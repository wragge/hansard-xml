<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce. I remind the Senate that the Minister told the Senate yesterday that `Immediately after the Channel 9 interview concluded' he realised he had made a mistake by casting doubts on the Budget's growth forecasts. I ask the Minister how this can be true when he then went on to repeat those same doubts in a second interview on the Ten Network half an hour later when he said, `whether those targets will be met is really too early to say'. Why did the Minister mislead the Senate?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Short wants to talk about misleading the Senate, he can do that very well by taking things out of context, which is what he has just done. As to the particular quote to which he refers, I said in the course of an interview&mdash;which was five minutes after I appeared on the Channel 9 program&mdash;that it was a question of when the Budget forecasts would be attained. That is quite consistent with what I said yesterday. I said:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>This is the test drive of the Opposition's low wage, high confrontation, low training, high taxation industrial relations policy. The $3 an hour plan does not work. It has proved to be a failure and, as a preview of a future wages policy, is a harbinger that the whole policy, if it ever had a chance to be implemented, would fail as well. This example proves that the labour market supports provided for youth training and youth employment do create work and an employer, a small businessman in Queanbeyan, says that that is the reason he has been able to employ young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That raises the question about the minimum rate that Mr Howard talks about and talked about last week at the National Press Club. What will be the minimum adult wage?  Last week Mr Howard could not say that. How would it be set? Last week Mr Howard could not tell us that. And what will be the transitional arrangements? Again Mr Howard was silent. None of these things are clear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But looking at the overall thrust of Opposition industrial relations policy, these factors stand out. It will be a low wage aimed at reducing wages; it will not be backed up, as our proposals are in wage fixation, with training and skilling up the economy; and it will create confrontation and disputation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I wish to pursue a little further the matter raised by Senator Short concerning the Government's prospects relating to forecasts of economic growth. I remind the Minister that in the Channel 9 interview he expressed the fact that he was not absolutely confident of the Government's forecasts in relation to growth. He then said to us yesterday that he realised immediately after the interview that he had not expressed it that well. But then he went on to Channel Ten&mdash;only a matter of minutes later, we understand now&mdash;and even more explicitly expressed the doubts that he had previously expressed in the Channel 9 interview, when he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . whether those targets will be met is really too early to say. I mean it's a sort of month by month thing.</PARA>

Senator Hill goes on to quote, `It is really too early to say, it is a month by month thing'. Of course it is because a growth rate develops over the 12 months of the year. Of course it is a month by month thing. Later on, again when I came back to that issue, I said, as I quoted a minute ago, `I'm not saying that it's impossible to attain the budget figures for a moment'. The Opposition's Peter Reith goes around the country dredging in every garbage can he can find in order to dig up a transcript which might have some ambiguity in it. This has no ambiguity in it. To try to make a bit of mileage out of this is really a desperate throw by the Opposition. Of course, that is what those opposite have done. They have selectively quoted from this transcript.

Yet later in the afternoon, he puts it straight by putting out a press release headed `Budget Forecasts Will Be Met Says Button'. Is there not a total inconsistency between what he said in the Channel Ten interview and what he put in the following press release; and, therefore, how can he say that he is putting the record straight by going into Channel Ten and simply reinforcing what he had said on Channel 9&mdash;and that is that he had real doubts about the ability of the Government to achieve its economic forecasts?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was also alleged that we lag behind the newly industrialised countries on automation in the car industry.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have trouble with the word `discriminate' in this question because, apart from half a dozen pilot courses which have previously operated, this is an entirely new initiative. We are introducing something here that did not apply before. In that sense, it does not discriminate; it confers an advantage on the community, particularly an advantage on people who, because of geographical isolation, do not have access to university or higher education, people who because of work and family responsibilities cannot attend or people who are in socially or physically disadvantageous situations. `Discrimination' is hardly the right word to apply to a new scheme that did not operate in Australia before.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be that the word `discrimination' is being used in this sense in relation to the fees. I do not think it can be said that the fees are genuinely a disincentive. There are 3,762 paid up participants in the pilot program at this stage. That exceeds the expectations of the Department and the Government when it first put forward this initiative. Broadly, the fees are no greater than the fees that would ordinarily apply under HECS. In that sense, there is a level playing field.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other questions that Senator Sowada raised are about quality. The quality of education in this case will be assured because we are using the existing universities. All of the existing universities are jealous, and rightly so, of their reputations for quality delivery and they have to protect those. It is not the same as the system that would have applied in the United Kingdom; so we cannot extrapolate from that example. We have also used the lessons learnt through the distance education centres in how to provide these services in a way in which they can be received and appreciated by the users.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, a major purpose of the initiative is to tap the economies of scale available from this teaching mode for the thousands of distance education courses currently available. The tendering process the open learning broker will use to purchase these materials will, by definition, ensure that the best courses are selected. Moreover&mdash;and I think Senator Sowada would be aware of this&mdash;last October the Government announced a quality assurance and enhancement initiative aimed at ensuring that all universities continue to seek to maximise the quality of their teaching provision. Since courses being offered by open learning will be drawn from the existing university sector, the Government's quality framework will be as relevant to open learning as it is to other aspects of higher education.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to marijuana, there has been no change in policy. Australian governments have a two-pronged approach, that is, to use law enforcement agencies to try to interdict supply to deal with the supply side. In particular, of course, the Australian Federal Police has a role in so far as there may be plantations, for example, in Papua New Guinea and there may be an attempt to bring marijuana products or cannabis products from those plantations across Torres Strait or from elsewhere overseas into North Queensland and then distribute them throughout Australia. State jurisdictions have their own responsibilities in so far as marijuana plantations might occur within their jurisdictions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the use of law enforcement and the criminal law is only a very small part of the effort to deal with drug abuse. Perhaps the more important part is the education and health rehabilitation side of dealing with abuse of drugs, whether legal or illegal. In that respect, Senator Reid may be interested to know that in Tasmania the gold medallist, Stephen Hawkins, the double sculls winner, has been appointed a drug offensive ambassador and is visiting most of the schools in Tasmania, encouraging our youngsters to understand that to smoke any product, whether it be tobacco or marijuana, would impair their health and their sporting performance and is therefore to be avoided.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is committed to ensuring that all Australians benefit from the Government's reform of the telecommunications system, not just those in highly populated areas. Tangible benefits of the Government's policy include a reduction in long distance call charges as competition is introduced. The Government has insisted that Optus extend its network coverage to the whole of Australia by the end of 1997 so that the competition provided by Optus to AOTC will be a reality no matter where one lives in Australia. The Government has also imposed a price capping regime on AOTC, which will mean that prices will be pegged to rise at 5.5 per cent below the CPI for a basket of services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AOTC has introduced a new pricing policy for the connection of telephones which will ensure that the vast majority of new customers will pay less. In rural areas customers on properties will save money by being able to dig their own trenches rather than having to pay AOTC to do it. Most importantly, the Government has imposed a universal service obligation on AOTC to require it to provide a basic telephone service and pay phones to all Australians. Austel has the task of ensuring that this obligation is met.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This arrangement was put in place following the announcement in 1990 that the Government's policy is based on the maintenance of community service obligations, particularly to rural and regional areas, pensioners, and people with disabilities. At present 94 per cent of Australians have access to the telephone. This is very impressive by international standards. But as Robin Davey, Chair of Austel, has commented, `Ninety-four per cent is only good for 94 per cent'. The Government is committed to ensuring that the remaining 6 per cent get access should they want it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to ensure that this commitment is being met, the Government has asked Austel to investigate whether and to what extent there are unmet needs in rural and remote areas in relation to the standard telephone service. The investigation is to provide an assessment of the current arrangements for ensuring the delivery of services throughout Australia, especially to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities which, of course, are amongst the most remote communities in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Austel has announced that it wants to hear from as many people as possible to assist in making recommendations to the Government. To this end it will conduct a series of public seminars in rural centres beginning in November. I have also asked Austel to conduct a separate investigation into the adequacy, location and accessibility of pay phones. Again, public comment is eagerly sought and seminars are going to be held by Austel for this purpose. Both of these inquiries will focus not only on ease of access but also on the quality of the service. It is no good having a phone if it is constantly breaking down and cannot be repaired. Both these reports are due to be delivered to the Government by the end of December this year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday the ABS produced the statistics for industrial disputation in Australia for the month of June and there are four quick points I can make about them. Firstly, the figures over the year show a continuing downward trend in industrial disputes in Australia under this Government. Secondly, the figures would have been better had it not been for the poor performance in New South Wales, particularly in October last year, when, because of the New South Wales Government's industrial relations legislation, there were major disputations in that State which pushed what was a low performance for Australia higher than it needed to have been had that Government adopted a more cooperative approach to industrial relations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the figures for Tasmania show a huge spike upwards in the graph, which indicates the massive dislocation in that State under the Opposition style industrial relations practised by APPM at Burnie; and, had that dispute not occurred, the figures would have been even better. Fourthly, it shows that the level of industrial disputation in Victoria&mdash;which is the point of this question&mdash;is off the bottom of the graph; that is to say, at record low levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point I would like to make in response to the question asked of me by Senator Cooney concerns comparisons with the Australian average. For Australia, the number of working days lost per 1,000 employees for the period was 194, the lowest since September 1990. However, Victoria reported 82 working days lost per 1,000 employees. Comparing the Victorian figure with the Australian average indicates that, certainly in the last months and generally over the last few years of the Kirner Government in Victoria, industrial relations was well handled, disputes were very low and there was a great deal of industrial harmony.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note those facts as there is now a change of government in Victoria and the new Government is embarking on what it calls, I think wrongly, industrial relations reform. One of the major differences between the two major parties in Australia is this: we have an ability to deliver industrial harmony and a peaceful industrial relations outcome; the Opposition has a high disputation, big confrontation industrial relations approach. In terms of foreign investors looking at this country, it is now becoming increasingly known abroad that Australia as a country is a good risk because industrial disputes are low. This could be jeopardised if the confrontationist approach of the Opposition were to be followed.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note the answer given by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Button) in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Hill on 13 October 1992 relating to forecasts of economic growth.</PARA>
<PARA>It would seem that the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Button) may well have misled the Senate in relation to his answers to Senator Campbell concerning tariffs on four-wheel drive vehicles. That is a matter that can be pursued. I can remember that when Senator Campbell asked the Minister whether any such letters seeking an increase in tariffs had been written, the answer was no, no, no. When the Minister was asked again, he was equally sure that there had not been any such letters. It now appears in fact that there have been representations. As I said, that matter can be further pursued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to raise another area of misrepresentation&mdash;that is, what the Minister said to us yesterday relating to his interview on Channel 9. That is of vital importance to the Australian people because, with nearly a million Australians out of work, the question of economic growth and what can be achieved in this financial year is absolutely vital. Even on the Government's published forecast, there is little hope for the one million people out of work. In fact, the growth figure must be considerably higher than the 3 per cent the Government estimated before the million people out of work can have any real chance of obtaining employment. And they are looking for that hope. The Government, particularly through the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, keeps trying to beat up their expectations. It is giving the unemployed unreal expectations from which the Prime Minister can cynically claim some political advantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister was more honest on television on Channel 9 at the weekend, and I readily concede that. In the light of the international situation and the depressing figures and indices that have been coming forward, he was not confident to stand up and support the Government's published forecast on growth. He said in relation to that forecast of 3 per cent, `I am not absolutely confident'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now find that the Minister went out of that interview into another one with Channel Ten, where he reinforced what he said in the previous interview. In other words, he reinforced his doubt about whether the Government would achieve its objective in terms of forecasted economic growth. I concede that he certainly said, `I hope we might achieve it', or words to that effect, but he cast doubt upon it and he demonstrated a second time that he had real doubts. He did it with the words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . whether those targets will be met, it's really too early to say. It's a sort of month by month thing.</PARA>
<PARA>As I said, in the light of what has been coming forward, it is quite understandable that he would reach that conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem for Senator Button, of course, is that that is not what the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, or Treasurer Dawkins want to hear, because that becomes politically difficult. What is politically difficult for this Government is, apparently in electoral terms, more important than facing up to its responsibility to the million Australians who are out of work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Button then had to cover his position. He subsequently put out a press release which was totally at odds with what he had said on Channel 9 and what he had said on Channel Ten. He headed that press release with the following words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Budget Forecasts Will Be Met Says Button.</PARA>
<PARA>That is not what he said on Channel 9; he said, `I cannot be absolutely confident'. On Channel Ten he said, `It is a month by month thing; it's really too early to say'. So his statements were inconsistent.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the afternoon, the Minister got into his political mould. He had responded in the way that Treasurer Dawkins and Prime Minister Keating required him to do. It is depressing that he would bend so easily. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is equally unsatisfactory is that, in order to provide a logical answer, he came into this place yesterday and misled the Senate by saying, `I realised after the Channel 9 interview that I'd simply not expressed it very well. I expected that there would be full employment, but I did not express it well. Therefore, I concluded immediately after the Channel 9 interview that I had said it badly and I therefore put out the press release'. We now know that that is untrue and this Minister should apologise. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support Senator Hill's remarks. There is no doubt that over the last two days Senator Button has misled the Senate on this issue. Yesterday he said that he had taken steps to correct a bad form of expression on the Channel 9 interview immediately after the Channel 9 interview had concluded. In response to a question from Senator Hill, he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I then took steps to put out a press release which reflected my view . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Then we discover, later in the day, that after the Channel 9 interview he had an interview with Channel Ten. That interview went even further than the Channel 9 interview. In that interview on Channel Ten, as Senator Hill has pointed out, he cast further doubts on the achievability of those growth forecasts contained in the Budget. I will quote the main parts of his Channel Ten interview:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the fact of the matter is it's all a question of timing.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . whether those targets will be met, it's really too early to say. It's a sort of month by month thing.</PARA>
<PARA>Then he went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'm not saying it is impossible to obtain the Budget figures for a moment.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Button, in his remarks here today, attempted to use the phrase `I'm not saying its impossible to obtain the Budget figures for a moment' to try to tell the Senate that he was supporting the growth figures and that that supports the view that he put out in his correcting press release late on Sunday, that `Budget forecasts will be met'. I put it to Senator Button and the Senate that there is a world of difference between saying, on the one hand, that it is not impossible to obtain the Budget figures and it is really too early to say whether those targets will be met, and saying, on the other hand, that the Budget forecasts will be met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Button misled the Senate, amongst other things, in addition to bucketing the Budget forecasts in the sense of walking away from them. That is what he has done; he walked away from the Budget forecast on television. That is a problem for the continuing disarray within his own Government and the division of views. The much more serious issue from the point of view of this matter in the Senate today is that Senator Button misled the Senate yesterday by saying that immediately on walking out of the Channel 9 interview he realised the mistake that he had made and he took steps to correct that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday Senator Button said that he had spoken to Treasurer Dawkins twice but today he said that he did not speak to any Minister until after he put out his press release at about 4 p.m. yesterday&mdash;more than six hours after the Channel 9 interview. If that was the case, I want to know&mdash;and I am sure the Senate wants to know&mdash;when were the two times that he did speak with Treasurer Dawkins and whether he is seriously expecting this Senate to believe that he did not speak to any other Minister of the Government or their staff in the six or more hours between his Channel 9 and Channel Ten interviews and the release of that press statement. It is simply unbelievable.</PARA>

<PARA>It is important to note that, in answer to the question on the constitutional conference in Darwin last week and a paper given to that conference by Senator Margaret Reynolds, Senator Collins today acknowledged that the Norfolk Island self-government situation cannot be used as a precedent for Aborigines or Torres Strait Islanders in any future application. That was an important acknowledgment. However, I was very concerned that Senator Collins weaved and ducked and shrugged when it came to answering how compatible Senator Reynolds's comments were with the policies of either the Federal Labor Government or the Australian Labor Party. Senator Collins had the opportunity, both in answer to the question and in answer to the supplementary question, to come forward with clear answers on that matter. We are all well aware that this is an important point because of the recent Mabo decision which has very important implications for the future. A number of initiatives are coming from indigenous people's conferences throughout the world and also, of course, from certain land rights and legal issues in Canada. A number of people are arguing very strongly for changes in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned that Senator Collins would not  dissociate either the Federal Labor Government or the Australian Labor Party specifically from Senator Reynolds's comments, which I have no truck with her holding as a personal individual, although I would disagree with many of her comments.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also take issue totally and fundamentally&mdash;and I took issue by way of a point of order&mdash;with the comments of Senator Collins when he said that I had denigrated Aborigines. I have certainly raised many issues in the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio that go to the heart of accountability and scrutiny&mdash;I do not give a damn whether a person is black, white or brindle; a crook is a crook is a crook&mdash;and I will conbtinue to ask questions in all circumstances where I believe there is a lack of accountability or proper scrutiny in the expenditure of money.

Certainly it is important that the issue be discussed in a constitutional conference context, but it is important to note that Senator Collins would not give the views of either the Federal Labor Party or the Federal Labor Government on this most important issue. </PARA>

<PARA>Senator Button came into the Senate after Question Time and finally admitted, after three questions and three denials of having received any representations or correspondence on the matter of four-wheel drive tariffs, that he had indeed received four letters during the past six to seven weeks.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This whole saga about the tariffs on four-wheel drives, and the `based on lies' phrase that Senator Button used with respect to certain elements of the mining industry and members of the Opposition, came out of a specific reference to a speech made by Hugh Morgan in Perth only a few days ago wherein Mr Morgan, quite properly it seems now, asserted that the Federal Government was giving consideration to increasing the tariffs on four-wheel drive vehicles. Senator Button said last week in the Senate that that assertion by Mr Morgan, the head of Western Mining Corporation, was `based on lies'. Senator Button has come into the Senate today and informed the Senate that he has received no fewer than four letters specifically dealing with the increase in tariffs on four-wheel drives. Indeed, one need now ask: who was the one who was lying?. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Button has today revealed that he has covered up the fact that this Government has received specific representations on increasing tariffs on four-wheel drives.

Senator Button has said that this assertion was based on lies, that the Government was not considering increasing tariffs on four-wheel drives. What the public now needs to know&mdash;and what I call on Senator Button to reveal&mdash;is who the companies are that are lobbying the Government to increase the tariffs. That is the question that requires an answer. </PARA>

Gee, I am sorry, Senator Campbell; even though I denied it and said that I had received nothing in the last six to seven weeks, I made a mistake'.

He has now come into the Senate and said that in the last six to seven weeks he has personally received four letters specifically dealing with that subject. The Senate is owed an apology.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The terms of this motion need little elaboration. Indeed, in many respects the facts speak for themselves. Perhaps the only criticism that one could genuinely concede is that we have understated the extent of the policy flip-flops that we have seen over the last four to five months in particular. Senator Collins of course, as probably the longest serving Minister in this portfolio over the last couple of years out of about four or five predecessors, is in a position to be acutely aware of many of those policy changes because he has been on the receiving end of most of them and in almost every instance has been comprehensively rolled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I go to the question which, as Senator Collins was kind enough to suggest, we should be debating now&mdash;and that was obviously why he declined to answer it when it was asked of him a short while ago. But all sides of politics, I suspect, would like to see digital compression introduced as quickly as possible; in other words, digital technology applied in the introduction of pay television. The only question, of course, that has always been around is: what would be the lead time? The purpose of my questioning Senator Collins was that he was on the record, in his usual mild and modest manner, comprehensively bagging anyone who dared to suggest that it might be possible to achieve it in the near term. Of course he was at that stage claiming that it was at least four to six years away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not have any quarrel with the proposition that, if it is around the corner, that ought to be the start-up technology. But I think it would be useful to all concerned if we could indeed have the correspondence, to which the Minister has referred, tabled in the Senate so that proper and objective judgments could be made about these matters. Senator Collins said, for instance, that Optus had recently tendered certain advice. Well, Optus of course was on the record several months ago in its submission to the Senate committee. What I think we would be interested in knowing is: what has changed since that time to persuade the Government from a position where, until yesterday, it had been resolutely defending the contrary proposition?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, the Department of Transport and Communications has been consistently tendering advice which has been very questioning of the proposal that digital technology was just around the corner and, if indeed this latest policy change is based on departmental advice, I would have thought we should hear about it in the same way that we heard from the Department during the committee hearings. Otherwise, of course, it simply indicates that the Government is making decisions to suit itself rather than trying to make policy fit the facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I invite the Minister to provide the Senate with a lot more information that would justify this decision. As I say, we are quite happy to support it, but we would like to be confident that consumers are not simply going to be asked to take another 12 or 18 months or even a couple of years breather before pay television comes along. As I recall, MPEG2 is not scheduled to be discussed until March of next year. No-one can assume that that will then result in the immediate adoption of a standard transmission technology and, therefore, I think we ought to know what the latest information is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One does not have to go back much beyond June to be horrified about the changes that have taken place in the Government's policy on pay television.

In other words, it has nothing to do with whether it is going to work, whether it really is just around the corner or whether those long suffering consumers who have waited since 1980 are going to be once more disappointed.

So I am grateful to him for his interruptions to that extent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us just look at some of the basic issues. The role of the ABC has been one in which we have consistently argued from the word go that the ABC ought to be mandated a place in the sun. Of course, if we were starting on analog, that would mean a transponder. For all intents and purposes, `channel' and `transponder' are interchangeable, are they not? But if one is talking digital, of course one is talking about a channel, unless one wants to give it at least four channels. We have always said that the ABC ought to get a channel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we go back and find out what position the Government has adopted on the ABC, it is quite extraordinary.

<PARA>The Prime Minister would not have a bar of it; over his dead body would the ABC get a guernsey. What did Senator Collins say? He was reported, as recently as the seventh of this month, as saying that while he supported the ABC's involvement in pay television, `you run into real difficulties if you think about mandating a role for the ABC'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government introduced its position on pay television in a very substantive fashion; that is, by way of legislation into this Parliament. Of course, this situation does not just apply to pay television. It applies to every single piece of legislation that the Government has in its program. We have a two-House system of parliament, a bicameral system of parliament, which I understood the Opposition supported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has said some very nasty things about people who want to abolish the Senate, but we started this debate with the absolutely nonsensical assertion by Senator Alston that the Government has committed a dreadful act in moving to make changes to its position on pay television in order to get the legislation through the Senate. That is what Senator Alston said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just point out to Senator Alston the blindingly obvious truth that that is indeed the very function of this chamber. That is what we do with Bill after Bill after Bill. We have a new system under which Bills are referred to special committees set up by the Senate&mdash;this Bill was in fact sent to a special committee&mdash;in order to seek common ground between the three major parties and the Independents so that legislation can be passed through the Senate. If we did not do that, none of the Government's legislation would be passed. I hate to point out that blindingly obvious truth to Senator Alston. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pay TV was excised from this Bill as a result of a motion moved by Senator Alston. As I said during Question Time, in terms of po-faced hypocrisy Senator Alston takes the cake. The Government is criticised in the matter of public importance proposed by Senator Alston for changing its position on pay TV. Yet the motion to refer this section of the Bill to a committee of the Senate in order to change the position of the Government was moved by Senator Alston himself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an absolute nonsense that Senator Alston is putting to this Senate. Indeed, as I have commented publicly, it is a fact that since part 7&mdash;that is, our position on pay television&mdash;was taken out of our Bill and removed to a Senate committee, we have been dealing with this matter assiduously. We have been dealing with this matter in a way which will produce a result which provides firstly, a viable pay TV model; secondly, one that is acceptable to the Government; and thirdly, if it is to see the light of day, one that will receive the support of the Senate. I did not think something as blindingly obvious as that would have to be restated for the benefit of Senator Alston. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot believe that Senator Alston ever actually appeared in court as an advocate. I will repeat for Senator Alston's benefit: `as long as it gets through the Senate'. That will not be the case, Senator Alston. I will repeat the three conditions: the first priority is to establish a model for pay television which is viable and which works; the second is one which is acceptable to this Government; and the third is one which of necessity has to get carriage in the Senate. They are the three criteria that the Government has used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts are that the Government has not been dealing only with pay television. Pay television in fact has been a relatively small part&mdash;it is certainly the one that has received most media attention&mdash;of the very substantial initiatives that this Government has taken in broadcasting legislation. We now have in place in this country a fundamentally restructured telecommunications regime where active competition is in place and more is on the way. I might add for the benefit of the Senate that the tenders for the third mobile licence for this country close tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have in place a complete revamp of broadcasting legislation for this country. A new authority has been set up under new legislation, the Broadcasting Services Act, and is now actually functioning. Pay TV was just a relatively small part of these initiatives in broadcasting. Pay TV was taken out of this broadcasting legislation by the Senate, not by the Government. But the other sections&mdash;the most important sections&mdash;of the Broadcasting Services Bill have not only been passed by the Senate and enacted, but also the new authority is now in place and is actually functioning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have just announced major reform of spectrum management by which the vast range of users will have better and more national access to spectrum. Spectrum management is unglamorous but it is the very fundamental base on which all broadcasting in this country is based. The spectrum management changes that the Government has announced are a significant part of its micro-economic reform agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So this Government can point to, firstly, an overhaul of telecommunications arrangements that dated back to Federation; secondly, a revamp of broadcasting regulation which was 50 years old; and, thirdly, reform of spectrum management arrangements which also dated unchanged from Federation. All of these areas have involved the Government having to deal with complex issues and conflicting interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pay TV is just one part of this very large package of reforms. It is an important part, but only one part. Notwithstanding the complexity, we are the only group of people to have worked out a pay TV regime. We tackled it after other people had dithered with it for 12 years. We are the ones who put the framework together. We are the ones who consulted manufacturers, the television and film industry, program providers and the rest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's framework was introduced into this Parliament as part 7 of the Broadcasting Services Bill and it was the Senate that took it out and insisted on changes. That is not a unique thing in the Senate. Despite Senator Alston's surprise, it actually happens every day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, as I commented on in Question Time today, the process involved the Leader of the Opposition, Dr John `take-no-prisoners' Hewson, sitting in the advisers box, hauling out poor old Senator Alston into the corridor and nailing his ears to the wall. He also hauled out Warwick Smith, the honourable member for Bass, who was also in the chamber. In order to accommodate at least six distinct shifts in policy changes by the Opposition from midnight till 2.30 in the morning, we agreed&mdash;the only time I have seen it done in here&mdash;to bring on the adjournment debate to allow them time to sort out their position. It was bizarre; it was straight out of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Monty Python's</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Flying Circus</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the almost 100 amendments introduced into this place by the Opposition, only eight were supported; and some of those were wrong and had to be fixed by the Government. We all remember&mdash;I know Senator Powell will&mdash;the amendment that the Opposition moved to protect journalists' sources. That amendment had the effect of ensuring that judges would be put in gaol for asking journalists to disclose confidential sources. As honourable senators will recall, the Opposition even put it in the wrong section of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to give the ABC a free transponder for pay TV were similarly ill-considered, appallingly drafted and totally unworkable. What this Government is about is producing good public policy in the interests of not just the industries affected but, more importantly and most importantly, the Australian consumer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the Opposition's policy on pay television? Is it reflected in the continuing stream of statements from the Opposition's spokesman on communications? No, it is not. The real agenda for the Opposition in referring this matter on the question of the ABC to a Senate committee and derailing it, was purely and simply to try to take attention away from the fact that it is committed in its Fightback document to emasculating the Australian Broadcasting Commission. I will have a bit more to say in a minute about the Opposition's illustrious Leader's amazing public statements about that. The Opposition is hell-bent on dismantling the national broadcaster of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to channels&mdash;Senator Alston talked about channels and transponders&mdash;as far as the Government is concerned, pay TV licences must be able to cater for any technology, be it satellite, cable or MDS. It is the service provided and not the technology used that is the concern of the Broadcasting Services Act and the consumer. The licensing of access rights to transponders was proposed in part 7 as a system neutral method that allowed the licensee to determine the transmission system and, hence, the capacity of the transponders. Optus has since said it will only offer channels, not transponders, for lease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Schacht interjected and said, `It is a fact that Optus has changed its position'. The very purpose of the meeting yesterday between Optus, myself and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was to enable Optus to tell the Prime Minister that it had fundamentally changed its position. It was the changed position and the advice that the provider of the satellite which is linked to this service gave to the Government that caused us to examine the current model that we are examining now. Despite contrary arguments, the model has great merit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To sensibly regulate licensed pay television, one must clearly define what is being licensed. The two transmission technology options for satellite services&mdash;digital or analog&mdash;could offer widely differing numbers of services. While a transponder-based regime could cope with either, the number being licensed would be uncertain. The Government therefore sees considerable merit in moving to license channels, as Optus wished, as a way of providing a flexible regime that is technology neutral and allows for the appropriate regulation of ownership capacity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as digital compression is concerned, I want to say this. Senator Alston said, `Table the document that has brought the Government to the position of making this decision'. We will table the report of the Senate Committee that Senator Alston served on. It is a fact, and it was agreed upon by every commentator whom I saw, that in terms of the disparity of the evidence given and the wide diversity of opinion in the reports that were being delivered, that Senate Committee report fundamentally took the debate back to square one. It fundamentally said to the Government, `At the end of the day, it is still your decision; make it'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the serious bidders for pay TV licences to whom I have personally spoken say that they intend to start their services with digital technology. Irrespective of whether one agrees or disagrees with the commencement of digital technology, it is a fact that we are reaching the end of the analog era and the beginning of the digital technology era. Like optic fibre cable to the home, CDV, as it is called in the business, is clearly the way of the future for satellite services. There are many advantages&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are advantages for Australia if digital technology is adopted from the outset. Australia would have the world's first digitally compressed, direct-to-home satellite pay TV service, as was recently pointed out by Bruce Gyngell. It would increase the number of channels per transponder on the Optus satellite fourfold and it would allow a more pro-competitive licensing regime. It would solve the problem of cost to the consumers for any transition from analog to digital technology, which was one of the matters that was of great concern to the Government and which we were trying to address in a number of ways. </PARA>

It would be a catalyst for upgrading the nation's communications infrastructure with state-of-the-art technology. More than one multi-channel operator could emerge to provide greater diversity and choice for the consumer of in-home entertainment. It would allow the networks to participate without dominating the service and to structurally adjust from the outset to this new medium and technology. Finally, it would allow the participation of the ABC in this service in a sensible way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, Senator Alston really takes the cake. The Government introduced its model for pay television as part 7 of the Broadcasting Services Bill. The Act came into force last week. The pay TV industry could have been well on its way now had the Opposition not chosen to block the passage of this Bill in the Senate during the last sittings. Who moved the motion to block its passage and refer it to a Senate committee? Senator Alston, the one who is now complaining that the Government has indicated that it is prepared to change its position on pay television in order to get this industry established and to get the Bill through the Senate. Why was the Bill hived off to the Senate Committee? As I said before, it is obvious to anyone that the coalition is anxious to allow the ABC into pay television so that it can cut off its funding. </PARA>

Four channels will be given to a current media operator within Australia. There are some real basic problems with that as far as the Democrats are concerned. First, it is very unfair to the ABC. If we give the ABC one channel and make sure that it is used for news, there will certainly be very good news and current affairs on that channel.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a lot of news channels out there waiting to get into the Australian market. Those news channels do not show Australian news. When I was overseas recently I looked at the CNN broadcasts and the BBC Asian broadcasts. There were two Australian stories on both of those in a two-week period. One was on dolphins on the north coast and one was on the Qantas jet which had been ordered to go back to where it was by Americans. Those are not substantial stories as far as Australia is concerned. They are not substantial enough to have an entire Australian news service based around them. I do not want do see that as my news. If the ABC puts up decent news, which it would&mdash;the Minister has agreed to that&mdash;it will have only that one news channel. If the ABC is to be mandated with this it should be given the same rights as any other station coming into this market right at the beginning. It should be given four channels and be able to do what it wants with them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a horror story. I do not want Australian subscription television to turn out like this. At the moment that is the way it looks like it is going.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a perfect pay TV world we would see several goals. The first of them would be digital. We would like to see everything go out in the beginning in digital. As the Minister said&mdash;I think he is completely right&mdash;there would not be any necessity for the general public to move from analog to digital. I think that is something that we all agree with and is the only positive aspect in what the Prime Minister announced last night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second goal is to see that the ABC is given a fair role. We do not believe that it has been given a fair role if what was announced last night is what is going to end up happening. The third goal is obviously cross-media ownership. We still believe, as I said, ad nauseam, that there is far too much power in the hands of far too few people. Foreign ownership is also important. We do not want to see too much foreign ownership; we want to keep it to the levels that are already established&mdash;that is, under 35 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Local content is very important. No comment was made on that. I hope the Minister can enlighten us. He is nodding his head. We would like to see local content in a perfect pay TV world not only on drama but on news and every channel. Anyone who wanted to have less than 20 per cent&mdash;I think 20 per cent is a reasonable minimum&mdash;would have to go to the Australian Broadcasting Authority and get an exemption to go under 20 per cent. I am talking about any channel; children's programs, drama, news, comedy, light entertainment and movies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Manufacturing content is another important aspect. That was certainly not mentioned last night. The report of the Senate Select Committee on Subscription Television Broadcasting Services has recommended that manufacturing content should be high, Australian, mandated and put into the legislation. That is something that we still maintain ought to be done. That was maintained by everybody. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Exclusivity is the other issue that we have been talking about. We still believe that if we start off with one player in pay TV, or even two, we will need some exclusivity period before everybody gets into it so that these people can actually get their act together, can get under way, can use Australian manufacturing and not have to go to Korea to get pieces and can actually get going and make some money. Everybody knows that the famous J-curve applies to pay TV. It has done around the world. We start pouring money in and then we get money back. That is why we need an exclusivity period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very pleased to hear the Minister support the work of the Select Committee on Subscription Television Broadcasting Services. I can recommend to him the tables in the report that show that the exclusivity period ought to be somewhere from three to seven years. I am referring to the ones on Australian content, which go from 60 per cent up to 70 per cent for manufacturing and 25 per cent up to 50 per cent for programming. I also recommend them to the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister made one very important point in his speech which has to be taken up&mdash;that is, the fact that the Opposition is saying that it supports the ABC but in its Fightback package it is saying that it would cut down on ABC funding by 10 per cent, which is outrageous. The Democrats could not possibly support that, would never possibly support that, and I am very encouraged by what the Minister has said that the Labor Party would not support that either. The ABC does a very good job on very little funds. It does not need to have them cut back any further. It cannot have them cut back any further. I am horrified to hear that that is what would happen in the Fightback package. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With such a diatribe against the Opposition, the government to be, I thought we were set for half an hour on that speech. This afternoon the Senate has before it a motion that was moved by Senator Alston. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's continuing policy shambles in the area of Pay Television as evidenced by yesterday's announcement of its fourth policy position in the last four months.</PARA>
<PARA>With the greatest of respect to the speakers who have preceded me, apart from Senator Alston, the point at issue is not the Government's policy on this but rather the great plethora of changes. We simply could not be precise in attacking a policy position of the Government because, frankly, we do not know what it is. It changes all the time and the Government  obviously cannot even brief journalists with the leaks in a consistent way so that one story can get in the press. It is no wonder we have a mess in the policy area when we have a speech like the speech we just had from the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins). He made a number of points which I will pick up in the course of my speech. I am glad for his sake he is going; he never likes punishment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He made a long diatribe about this being a bicameral legislature and somehow or other we did not understand that fact. I can assure him that the Liberal Party understands very well the position of a Senate in a bicameral legislature and the position and the importance of checks and balances on a legislature. We certainly never wanted to get rid of this chamber the way the Labor Party did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister was making the point that he was changing his position constantly because somehow or other legislation had to pass both chambers. That really is dissembling. He is saying that the Government is groping for a position which will be acceptable to this Parliament. It does not have any policies of its own; it is just stumbling along trying one theme after another, one change after another, so that it can try to get something through the Parliament. There is no fixed philosophic or technical position in what the Government is proposing. The great number of policies that it has run through this Parliament on pay TV is witness to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Alston made the point that there were four positions. I understood Senator Collins to say, by way of interjection at Question Time today, that there were only three. Having just looked at my file and found this great heap of papers outlining government policy over the years, I believe there were far more than three. But how many policies there are does not matter; the point is that there should have been only one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Government came into the chamber with its legislation it should have known precisely what it wanted to achieve. Instead, as I said before, it is just groping for a solution to a problem which I do not think it understands fully. Those opposite do not understand fully the technical ramifications of it, they certainly do not understand its implications in relation to industry policy and the Australian community, and I do not think they really understand its implications for the existing players in the field&mdash;the free to air television people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this is one of the reasons for the malaise in the country. It is not only in the area of television that the Government does not know where to go, but also I do not think it knows where it wants to go on any point. If there is one thing the community needs at the present time, having got into all of the difficulties we are in under the Labor Party, it is a clear direction as to where we are going and how we will get out of the mess we are in. We see right across the spectrum of the Government's activities a total inability to know where it is proceeding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is particularly important in relation to business. I do not carry a brief for business. I am no Engine Charlie Wilson, the head of General Motors in the 1930s, who said that what was good for General Motors was good for the USA. But I do believe business has an important place in the community and the Government cannot be negligent of its interests. Unless we have profitable business in the country we will have high unemployment and falling community standards. So the welfare of business is very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In dealing with business, the Government does not have to make commercial decisions on its behalf, but it does have to get rid of the fog of obscurity as to what its policies might be. Business is well able to cope with difficulties in the marketplace. What it cannot cope with is the uncertainty of not knowing what the rules will be today and what they will be tomorrow. Business needs to know whether it can invest money, go to the banks and underwrite loans so that it can see a way in which to carry on. Certainty of government is one of its key requirements. It is one of the fundamental failings of this Government that at the moment it is providing absolutely no certainty at all for Australian business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The television inquiry, which I was a part of, and the way in which the legislation has been handled is witness to the fact that the Government does not know where it wants to go or how it wants to get there. We were promised at the early part of this Parliament that pay television legislation would be introduced, and it only came in before the winter recess at the very last moment. The reason it came in so late was that, even then, the Government did not know where it wanted to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is not correct for the Government to view pay television as it does: as just a small segment of the entertainment industry. Quite clearly, the Government, the Minister or the Cabinet do not understand the importance of pay television in the scheme of things in the Australian community. It is not merely a matter of entertainment, as they see it; it is part of the whole communications industry which is one of the most central industries in a modern industrial society. So many things turn on this: the whole business of data transfer, information technology and transfer, the machinery of providing that, and the business of writing software programs. All of these are very high value added activities and there are many spin-offs in the communications industry other than the ability to sit down, throw a switch and watch a movie or a sporting event. In this decision the Government is absolutely blind to all of these other elements</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an area where very rapid and exciting changes are taking place. There is a possibility of linking houses and  buildings together&mdash;even units within the buildings&mdash;and being part of what is known as the interactive communications area, with people talking, transferring data and all the rest of it. This is all part and parcel of the larger picture and it is something to which Australia cannot close its eyes. We have to be part of it or we will be paying, and paying heavily, for other countries to provide those services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another thing the Government has not considered in its policy is the relationship of the free to air providers&mdash;the three established channels and the ABC&mdash;to the introduction of pay TV. We are a small country with a small population. While the introduction of a new format in the form of pay TV will clearly increase the number of people watching television, one can be quite certain that there will be a diminution in the audience which is at present watching free to air television&mdash;channels 7, 9, 10 and the ABC&mdash;because a competitor will be introduced into the pool. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That will have a marked influence on the profitability of the present free to air commercial stations. The days are long past when those stations had a licence to print money. Times are now pretty competitive for them and, while they should be making a profit, I do not think they have too much room to move in their commercial activities before they get into a great deal of trouble. Whilst I do not think it is the Government's business to guarantee their viability in any way, I think, having set up the legislative framework under which these channels were established, the Government clearly has an obligation not to do anything which makes precipitate change to their continued existence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to where we have gone with these policies. I have said that the introduction of the legislation was very tardy because the Government did not know where it was going with it. When the first announcements were made about the legislation, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), at the behest of his friends in the industry, made ex cathedra statements right over the top of his Minister at the time who was responsible for the legislation which was coming into the Parliament. The legislation was brought into the Parliament and the Senate simply could not agree on what was being presented. The Government then made overtures to the Australian Democrats and others around the place and tried to get something done. The Prime Minister came in again with further amendments to policies&mdash;all done on the run. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one goes through the files one will find that all sorts of positions have come from the Prime Minister. He has advocated a position whereby there would be no advertising on pay television, but he walked away from that. He then came up with the proposition that the first four transponders would go as a block, they would have 12 months breathing space and then the other two channels would go. We then had the Senate pass legislation which went to the House of Representatives. We had another position from Mr Keating and then we had the Senate inquiry. We then had a prohibition from the Prime Minister on the ABC being a part of the program. It now seems that all of that has gone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to deal for a moment with the claim&mdash;which was made falsely by Senator Collins&mdash;that there is a war between the ABC and the Opposition. The honourable senator made all sorts of allegations to the effect that we wish to cut off funding and drive the ABC out of business. That is not our intention at all. When we are in debt to the tune of $6 billion&mdash;I am not sure whether that is what it is this year; it is probably going up day by day and adding to our internal Budget deficit&mdash;we obviously cannot go on living beyond our means. There is nothing sacrosanct about the ABC. If we are going to cut back the defence budget, as the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) indicated in the Budget, and get rid of expenditures for what are fundamentally important departments, the ABC has to take its place along with the rest of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to quote a few things that, purely by chance, I have with me. I was not going to use them, but since Senator Collins brought the matter up I will. I have here a transcript of an interview with the Prime Minister by Maxine McKew on 3 June. She asked him something about the ABC getting into pay TV and he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well they are out of one to four, because I think everybody is tired of the old faded and jaded players, they want some new entrants in the Australian media. That's what the Caucus wanted, they wanted a new media player who has not had its antecedents in the newspapers, or in existing television networks, but a new set of players. And the arrangement the Government has now introduced, or will be introducing, is for the first four transponders, we'll see in a new medium of media&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is a strange phraseology&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a new set of players.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If anyone is opposed to the ABC, Mr Keating fits the said bill. There are plenty of views on this. I have here a quote from Mr Tom Burton in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>. I quote one paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The complete opposition by Mr Keating, who seems to have an almost obsessive hatred of the ABC, to any concession for the Corporation means that there is now a very real chance that the Government will not be able to secure passage through the Senate of its pay TV legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>That was earlier in the year. I have also found an interview with Mr David Hill, the Managing Director of the ABC, on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> program of 1 June. I would like to read one of the paragraphs which is in context to that which I am saying where Peter Thompson asked him about Mr Keating's position. Mr Hill said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Frankly, no. I must say in fairness to Keating, as a new Prime Minister, this communications policy is very complex. As a new Prime Minister, I think he has the right to feel comfortable about the way it's been developed. But if you think about this, the arbitrary five-year moratorium on pay expires in October; we've been debating the detail of this for at least two to three years; we've had six Cabinet Ministers; untold changes to the rules; and here we are at the 11th hour with, we understand, the proposal going into Cabinet today. . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is all very true&mdash;untold changes to the rules. I return to where I started. We have a situation where the Government simply does not know what it wants to do. It briefed a whole series of journalists last night. I have read most of those accounts. The inconsistencies of those accounts illustrate the fact that the Government still does not have a coherent policy. Until the Government knows what it wants to do, there is no hope of it being able to come into this chamber and put a clearly reasoned and coherent argument before the Parliament, and then the Parliament can decide whether to support those policies for the introduction of pay TV. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter of public importance brought before the Senate by Senator Alston concerns the Government's policy on pay television and the introduction thereof. I speak as a person who has been involved in pay television, as Chairman of the Select Committee on Subscription Television Broadcasting Services and as a member of the Labor Party's Caucus committee in this area. Pay television is an important issue, but it is obviously not the major or even one of the major issues before the Australian people. But it does attract an inordinate amount of interest amongst aficionados of the media in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over recent weeks and months, I would have thought that the amount of space given in the printed media in particular but also in the electronic media to discussion about pay TV has been extraordinary. I would like to have a dollar for every time any one of the following journalists have tried to ring me or have rung me for views about pay television. This is in no sense a list of honour, but I think they ought to be given a mention because they have often given me a mention, sometimes without even speaking to me. Joanne Grey, Tom Burton, Bina Brown, Peter Wilson, Deanie Carbone, Fred Brenchley and too many to even list from the ABC have all been persistent in wanting to write, discuss and talk about pay television. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, much of their interest is because it is in an area of their own employment, their own interest, and because of their own concerns about issues relating to the existing television networks, newspapers, the ABC, telcos and so on. I do not blame them for having that interest, but I reiterate that in my time here in the Senate I cannot recollect a specific issue that has attracted so much attention from journalists. I will not decry it; I think it is very good as part of the public debate because there are important issues about the structure of the operation of pay television in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to some of the remarks made by previous speakers and some of the general comments made in the community. First of all, Senator Alston quoted Mr Mansfield, the Managing Director of Optus, in his remarks some weeks ago criticising the Government's policy as announced and brought into this chamber on pay television, saying that it was a disgraceful way and it was inconsistent and so on. Mr Mansfield has never mentioned that, in Optus's first submission to the pay TV Select Committee, it argued for a restrictive form of pay television: one licence holder to have an exclusive licence for seven years in which to operate a very restricted system&mdash;mainly, I suspect, the best way, Optus thought, to get a return on its transponders in the satellite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then just two or three days before the completion of the Senate Select Committee's work Optus suddenly announced that it had done a 180-degree turn. It no longer argued for any exclusivity, it no longer argued for a limited number of licences; it said, `Let us go straight to digital and, in that, anyone who wants a licence to broadcast in pay television via our satellite will get one'. That is the dramatic change Optus made. It was a 180-degree turn in just 2 1/2 weeks from when Optus personally gave evidence before the Committee at the beginning of our hearings to that which it then announced at the end of the period in a document circulated to the press. So I am a little bemused by the criticism of Mr Mansfield in his comments on Government policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we come to the comments made by the Opposition. It has been criticising the Government on the structure of and the Government's discussions about pay television. Let us have a look at what the Opposition is up to. When the Opposition debated pay television in this chamber, we found Senator Alston sitting at the table being tapped on the shoulder every three seconds almost from the adviser's desk by Mr Warwick Smith, the shadow spokesman on telecommunications, changing their minds on any number of issues, particularly the role of the ABC, as they tried to work out an arrangement with the Australian Democrats to get the matter referred to a select committee. It seemed, certainly from this side, a very belated interest in the ABC from the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, when Opposition senators actually came to write their report, it was not surprising to the Government members of the Committee to find that they had put in a dissenting report. They basically dissented from everything. When we get to the bottom line in their dissenting report to the pay TV Committee's report, they basically have no policy at all. They have no industry policy. They have no policy on industry, on what participation there should be for Australian industry to get its share and to ensure that we can develop a manufacturing industry based on pay television in Australia. They do not want a bar of that. They do not want a bar of rules that establish a minimum level of Australian content for pay television. That has all gone by the board. So, again, another part of Australian industry is wiped out. They do not want to have any cross-media ownership rules. It does not concern them at all. They just raffle off, auction off, the six existing transponders for whoever is the highest bidder to do with them what it likes. They do not want any cross-ownership rules, content rules or industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, in their questioning in the Committee they showed no concern at all for any question of commercial viability. They did not accept any level of exclusivity. They were not concerned, in discussions with any of the people who came before the Committee to give evidence about how to establish pay television, that commercial viability, in any way, should be a concern of the Australian Parliament, the Government or anybody else. As far as they were concerned, if people want to make an investment and the whole thing falls apart, that is their problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite said here today that the Government does not have a policy. The Government did introduce legislation into this chamber, passed by the House of Representatives, outlining a model for pay television. The Senate did not carry it because the Opposition and the Democrats referred that section to the pay TV Select Committee. But we did come up with a model. The only model that we have before us from the Opposition&mdash;because we certainly cannot rely on what Mr Smith has said as being a model&mdash;is what is in the report, and there is no model at all in the report. The Opposition says, `We are not interested in any rules whatsoever'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The final thing about the role of the Opposition towards providing a mandated channel for the ABC is its own view towards the ABC. Senator Bourne said that they want to cut $50m off the ABC budget. That is a reduction from $500m at the moment to $450m. That will do much more damage to the ABC than providing it with a mandated pay television channel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was bemused the other day in Adelaide to be involved in a radio debate on the ABC with Alexander Downer, a senior shadow Minister for the Opposition, when he was questioned about the impact of the $50m cut backs for the ABC outlined in Fightback. He said, `But, of course, the $50m can be recouped by the ABC because of the money they are going to make out of pay television'. Nobody in any of the hearings we had or any of the evidence before us said that the ABC was going to make $50m a year from year one of the operation of pay television. That was the paucity of the argument and the knowledge the Opposition has about the ABC and, above all else, about pay television. Everybody believes, and gave evidence, that it would take a number of years for pay television to start making a profit, but Mr Downer says that from year one the $50m cut back in Fightback for the ABC can be covered by the profits from pay television. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issues still to be resolved in pay television are the basic issues that we have been debating for so long now. No matter how you argue or juggle them, there is always going to be an argument about the balance between the three basic issues. I have said this before in the Senate in previous debates. We have to balance exclusivity to help commercial viability, with diversity of ownership to provide a more diversified media in Australia, vis-a-vis providing competition so consumers get a choice. Viability, diversity and competition are principles that are in conflict with each other and we have to balance the three to get a workable model. In doing so, we have to make some concessions and compromises on the purity of each of those positions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final argument that has to be resolved is an issue that is vexing everybody&mdash;and I defy anybody at the moment to have the perfect answer&mdash;of whether we should start with an analog technology or wait a bit longer and start with digital. In the Committee that I chaired, we got absolutely conflicting evidence. Some people said start with analogue because digital is too expensive. Others said wait till digital, because it will provide a wider capacity and a more profitable system because it can provide more channels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we cannot get agreement from any of the experts as to exactly when the digital standard will be established world-wide. We cannot get any agreement on the cost of a digital decoder&mdash;black box&mdash;system to operate for the consumer. The general figures are agreed that an analog so-called black box would be around $200 to $300 for the consumer. Figures for a digital black box are now ranging between $800 and $1,400. Everybody says that that will affect the commercial viability for pay television to operate because that cost to consumers is such a substantial amount they may not be willing to make that investment. If the operators themselves want to provide it as a leasing option, the investment figure for them is so high that it still may make pay television in the opening years of digital such a loss making operation that it cannot even start. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is one of the arguments that has to be debated and carefully considered. It should not be done in an ideological manner or a point scoring manner. It is a matter of extreme technical complexity of whether we should start with digital or whether we should start with analog and migrate to digital. Even this afternoon, I have had further submissions put to me by interested people pointing out that digital will certainly cost in excess of $1,000 and will take more time to develop, but everyone agrees that ultimately digital will be the technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue that has to be dealt with is what level of encouragement we give to the manufacturing sector of Australian industry to produce the equipment that is internationally competitive in both price and technology. Then we can develop an industry that not only provides the equipment in Australia but can also get into providing equipment for the export market in the biggest expanding market of all for pay television, which is our own region, the Asia-Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I turn to Australian content. If we do not have some rules for Australian content in pay television, it will be overwhelmingly derivative from programming content from other countries. That will not encourage Australian producers to produce content&mdash;not only for Australian pay television, but also for sale to pay television in other parts of the world. In both of those areas I believe we need a model that establishes rules for manufacturing industry and for Australian program content. I believe that the Australian content rules should encourage individual production houses not in-house production, because in-house production is much harder to define and keep tabs on as to how much is being spent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debate on pay television has obviously gone on for a lengthy period. I believe that we will get a decision to come back into this chamber in the very near future where this Senate chamber will decide the issue politically about the model of pay television. The Government introduced a model here previously, the Opposition parties and the Democrats opposed it and it went to a select committee. We will have to deal again in the very near future with a model with further amendments to get a political outcome to a decision that this chamber created two months ago. </PARA>

It is happening because the Government, as part of its process of deregulating telecommunications and introducing competition to Telecom, took the opportunity to unload the massively indebted Aussat satellite to Optus Communications, the new competitor. The carrot dangled before Optus in the deal to purchase Aussat was a monopoly for satellite delivered pay TV. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a further problem from the outset in settling the eventual policy framework for pay TV because there was a succession of changes in transport and communication Ministers. There were Ministers Beazley, Kerin and Richardson and, finally, Minister Collins, who is right at the coalface of the introduction of the legislation. That led to a significant role in the policy process being taken by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) who, I do not think, makes any claim to be anything of an expert, as perhaps none of us do, in this highly technical area. But I think it changed the politics of the policy making process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That led to a further complication: the difficulty of the dilemma of having a Prime Minister whose inclination was obviously to include present media players&mdash;the `media mates'&mdash;and a Caucus which wanted them excluded. The eventual legislation saw the Prime Minister offer a so-called compromise, which was really very little of a compromise, whereby only 12 months separated the first new player from the open slather for the Packers, Murdochs, et al. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that point, the potential new players&mdash;people interested in getting into this new industry&mdash;and others seeking to enter in other areas to build a new industry in this country, in the manufacturing sector and in program production in particular, cried foul and, to my mind, rightly so. I agreed with them and I put their case in this chamber and in the public arena&mdash;a case for a longer exclusive period for the first new player in a new industry in this country, an industry coming in on the cusp of significant technological change. The crunch issue there was the question of viability. If we were going to have a new industry, it needed to be one that would work, not just for those with a commercial interest, but also for the consumers and indeed for the culture of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seemed at that point that no-one else could see the problem that was inherent in this initial policy as we saw it here in the chamber. However, the committee reference that I had sought on behalf of those interested in getting into this industry did come about, but it only came about because Warwick Smith, on behalf of the Opposition, discovered the ABC. As a result of the Opposition's last minute policy shambles, very well illustrated at Question Time by the Minister&mdash;and I do not have time to go through it again, much as I would love to&mdash;we did get a committee reference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I supported then, as I do now, a longer exclusive period for the first new player, the first new licensee, also with ABC involvement at the outset. That would allow what I think both the Opposition and the Government would want&mdash;good economic rationalists that they are&mdash;which is the market to decide what the technology would be, when the thing would commence and when the consumers would be properly protected. There is a great deal that one could say on this debate. I agree that digital start up is very important, but a new player could make that decision if he had the time in the commercial operation with an exclusive period that worked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, I have no objection to policy change where it brings better policy. At the moment it looks as though the policy the Government might be putting forward will, in fact, be Opposition policy and if that is the case, I hope there is another policy change yet to come. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">VISIT TO JAPAN, SINGAPORE AND CAMBODIA</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I take this opportunity to inform the Senate of the outcome of the visit the Prime Minister made to Japan, Singapore and Cambodia between 20 and 26 September.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This overseas visit was his third since becoming Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All three visits have been to Asia-Pacific countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All three visits have helped put a sharper focus on Australia's relations with the region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A primary objective of each visit has been to talk with other regional leaders about how we can work together to respond to the fluid outlook in the region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But just as importantly, the Prime Minister has also wanted to underline to both Australian and foreign audiences how much the Australian economy has shifted towards an international orientation, especially an Asia-Pacific orientation;  how much Australia has already achieved in the region; and how much our future depends on successfully carrying forward this engagement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More than is sometimes appreciated, the Asia-Pacific region is in the midst of a period of profound transition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The strategic consequences of the end of the Cold War are still working themselves out.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The regional security outlook is generally favourable, but less predictable than before.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The peace process in Cambodia, which involves an ambitious role for the United Nations, confronts a serious test of its sustainability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fluidity in the international trading environment is increased by uncertainty about the outcome of the Uruguay Round.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whatever the outcome of the Round, we shall probably see an increasing trend towards regional, subregional, and bilateral trade arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regional governments are now required to develop policy responses to what could well be a rapidly evolving pattern of trade alignments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Asia-Pacific countries also need to consider how international and regional institutions can better reflect the growing weight of the region in world affairs, and the increasing importance of intra-regional linkages.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister's visit to Japan was very worthwhile in consolidating with the Japanese Government the strong community of interest we have with them in responding to these important questions. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian public understands very well Japan's significance in our external relations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Japan is the world's second largest national economy, accounting for about 14 per cent of global output.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been our largest trading partner since 1970.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Perhaps more than is generally appreciated in this country, Australia is also an important regional partner of Japan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are Japan's third largest source of imports and sixth largest trading partner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bilateral trade relationship, now worth around 24 billion Australian dollars, is one of the principal sinews of economic interdependence in the Western Pacific.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The close dialogue between the two governments on regional and international issues reflects the habit of friendship and cooperation that has grown up between the two countries in recent years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Certainly, the warmth of the Prime Minister's reception by the Japanese Government and the quality of his discussions with Prime Minister Miyazawa and his Ministers attest to the maturity of the relationship that we now enjoy with Japan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The comments of Mr Miyazawa and his Ministers reflected, I think, a realistic view of the international scene.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was cautious optimism that the Japanese economy would return to a stronger growth path from the end of this year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was a determination, which the Prime Minister supported, that Japan should play a more active role in international affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister affirmed Australian support for Japan's permanent membership of the United Nations Security Council so that the world body can better reflect changed world circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He welcomed Japan's decision to participate in United Nations peacekeeping operations, and the opportunity this provides for our military and civilian personnel to work together in support of the Cambodia peace process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister discussed international and bilateral trade issues with both Prime Minister Miyazawa and International Trade and Industry Minister Watanabe.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They acknowledged an uneasiness in Japanese political and business circles about the increasing trend to preferential trade arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prime Minister Miyazawa expressed the personal view that an open and non-discriminatory multilateral trading system could be maintained despite these developments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He made clear his government's deep commitment to a cooperative relationship with the United States, and its support for an early and successful outcome of the Uruguay Round.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In underlining the importance of the bilateral trade relationship with MITI Minister Watanabe, the Prime Minister said that Australia would not be party to any trade arrangement which was directed against Japan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This commitment was reciprocated by Minister Watanabe's assurance that Japan would conduct its trade on a commercial basis without discrimination against Australia's interests in any arrangements with third countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Minister Watanabe reiterated this undertaking in the particular case of Australia's exports of automobile parts to Japan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In discussing the outlook for the Uruguay Round, the Prime Minister urged Japan not to hold back on the rice tariffication issue, because otherwise it ran the risk of being portrayed by others as a final obstacle to a settlement on agriculture.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Japanese Government acknowledged the responsibility it faced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister's discussions with Japanese Ministers also covered the need for expanded bilateral air services to cater for the expected increase in tourist traffic, MITI's support for Australia's trade promotion in Japanese regional centres, and Japanese involvement in the MFP project in Adelaide.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a general discussion of defence relations, the Prime Minister confirmed the Government's satisfaction with the current moderate level of activity which includes high-level visits and dialogue on strategic issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government attaches considerable importance to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation or APEC process as an essential mechanism for promoting open regionalism.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister explained to Prime Minister Miyazawa the thinking behind the Government's proposal for establishing over the medium term a process for periodic heads-of-government meetings based on APEC membership.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such meetings would add political weight and status to the APEC process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They would fill a significant gap in institutional arrangements in the region, enabling leaders to consult together in a way which has become familiar in European and trans-Atlantic relations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister was encouraged by a marked firming of Japanese support for the proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prime Minister Miyazawa welcomed the initiative and agreed that the idea should be pursued further in consultation with other members of the region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Former Prime Minister Takeshita also firmly supported the proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A special feature of the visit was the Prime Minister's agreement with Prime Minister Miyazawa to issue a joint statement setting out for the public record an account of the regional perspectives which figured prominently in our discussions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The statement demonstrates convincingly the extent of parallel interests we share with Japan in regional strategic and economic issues, and the potential we have for working together productively in the region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It also makes clear that the cooperative relationship we aim to pursue with Japan is by no means an exclusive one.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rather, it is directed towards broad-based cooperation with other countries in the Asia-Pacific region, including especially the United States.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to speak on the Cambodian element of the Prime Minister's statement. I was fortunate enough to spend six days in Cambodia immediately before the Prime Minister (Mr Keating); I left on the Tuesday morning and he was there on either the Friday or the Saturday. I went there on a private visit as the Deputy Chairman of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. I had an absorbing and fascinating visit to that country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cambodia is described in the textbooks as a very poor country, and that is certainly true, as one sees when one gets there. It is a country which has suffered very much over the years&mdash;over the millennia, in fact&mdash;because it is a buffer, in one sense, between the Vietnam state on the eastern side and the state of Thailand on the west. Over the last few thousand years, waves of invaders from either side have swept over it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does have a very rich core, running north-west to south-east. The Tonle Sap lake and river provide a very fertile rice belt. In earlier times, a very highly developed culture flourished there, to which the temples of Angkor Wat and the others in that region bear testimony. Cambodia was supported by an agricultural economy that placed a great deal of emphasis and sophistication on water retention and water management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The capital of the country, Phnom Penh, is described as one of the most elegant towns in Asia. It certainly would have been that but for the vicissitudes that have befallen it in recent years. The principal of those was the emergence of the Khmer Rouge regime under Pol Pot, which was one of the most barbaric regimes ever to control any country. While we have all seen pictures of the ossuaries and things like that in magazines and on television, until one goes there and sees the torture chambers, the torture instruments and the rest of it, one really does not appreciate the full significance of the barbarity of that regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other consequence of it was that the Khmer Rouge killed off anyone with any education at all. I do not mean only people who went to university; anyone who was literate or had any semblance of education at all was killed off. Anyone related to foreigners, anyone who spoke a foreign language, even anyone who had glasses, was killed off. The consequence of that is still with the country today. Every person with any skill in the country between 1974 and 1978 was killed off. It has left a terrible legacy. On Christmas Day 1978, Vietnam invaded Cambodia and displaced, but did not destroy, the Khmer Rouge. For the past 11 years, there has been a government there, the State of Cambodia Party, ruling the country with Hun Sen as the President. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout last year, after many, many years of negotiations, an agreement for several things to occur was reached. This led to the United Nations force going in this year to be a transitional authority. The four parties to that agreement agreed that there would be cantonment and disarming of the armies of the four relevant factions; that there would be border checkpoints set up at a number of places in the neighbouring countries of Thailand, Laos and Vietnam; and that voters would be registered for free and fair elections in May of next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence of that, UNTAC, the United Nations Transitional Authority of Cambodia, was set up. Today there are some 22,000 United Nations personnel in the country, of whom something like 15,000-odd are military personnel. Australia makes a very significant contribution to those and that is why I was in Cambodia. The Australian service contingent there has a strength of about 550 service personnel&mdash;men and women&mdash;providing all the communications for the United Nations force. Cambodia is a country where that facility is absolutely crucial because civilian infrastructure throughout most of the country does not exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian contingent in Cambodia is providing all the communications: the VHF/ HF radios, the data transmission, microwave links, facsimile and telex services, telephone services and even a courier service. The Australian contingent extends throughout the whole of Cambodia. The principal attachment is at a place called Pettea Australie, which is halfway between Pochentong, the airport for Phnom Penh, and Phnom Penh city itself. There are about 150 Australians there providing communications for the capital city. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next big detachment is at Battambang. The rest of the Australian contingent is distributed elsewhere&mdash;sometimes in groups as small as three soldiers living entirely by themselves and supporting themselves right out in very distant parts of the country. The general opinion of the Australian contingent is extremely high. Everyone to whom one talks in the United Nations is very praiseworthy of what the Australians are doing in Cambodia. Indeed, I was intensely proud to see them&mdash;they are well-disciplined, their morale is high and they are providing a very professional service. I think they are providing far and away the best service of any of the 30-odd nations that make up the United Nations military contingent. It is very rewarding to see members of the Australian contingent going about their job with great professional skill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cambodia is not an easy place in which to live. There is very little water in the country that is fit for drinking. The Australian contingent has a great advantage in this regard. Two patented water softener or water purification plants have been developed for the Australian defence forces. They have been a brilliant success. One at Pettea Australie and another one at Battambang provide a voluminous supply of fresh water. As a result, the troops have not only unlimited supplies of water for drinking and for cooking but also plenty of water for showering and for other activities. Every week troops in outlying posts, including the two or three personnel in the most remote parts of the country, get resupplied not only with food but also with drinking water in jerry cans. So that side of the exercise is very well handled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the best traditions of the Australian Army, the Australian contingent is cleaning up the campsite at the old barracks at Pettea Australie. Again, the Australian personnel are doing the best they can with respect to hygiene and building in creature comforts so that the camp can operate efficiently. Their service equipment, much of which is designed in this country, is all Australian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Great success has been achieved with the Raven radios with which the ADF is now becoming equipped. These high frequency radios have worked brilliantly well in that environment. They have worked as they were designed to do. The Raven series of radios, which are a world leader, were built to a specification drawn up by the Australian defence forces, and it is very pleasing to see them performing the way their designers intended them to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also using the Australian Perentie vehicles up there&mdash;the Landrovers and the Unimogs. Of course, the troops are wearing their DPC, disruptive pattern clothing, with the new webbing and they are equipped with the new personal weapons. It is all very impressive. As I said earlier, the Australian personnel are very highly spoken of, and well they might be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to put on the public record my thanks to Senator Ray, the Minister for Defence, who supported fully my visit to Cambodia. I was basically under the aegis of the Department of Defence, not the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade as would be the normal practice when visiting a country such as Cambodia. Senator Ray, as he has on all previous occasions, gave me the full cooperation of the Department. I have written to him privately thanking him for that. I would like to take the opportunity now of publicly thanking him for the support that he gave me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to thank the land commander of the Army, General Murray Blake, who is responsible for the Australian contingent deployed as part of UNTAC, and Lieutenant-Colonel Ayling, the CO of the signal regiment up there. When I said there were 550 Australians up there, I did not mention that that number includes 20 New Zealanders. As well as the Army signallers, we have about 20 signallers drawn from the RAN and from the RAAF. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My final word of thanks goes to Colonel Chamberlain, the defence attache at the Australian Embassy in Phnom Penh, whom I found to be quite an outstanding officer. He looked after my visit. There was not one wasted moment in the six days I was in Cambodia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) relating to his recently completed trip to Japan, Singapore and Cambodia. I want to say a few words regarding his visit to Cambodia. I also feel obliged to say something on the Prime Minister's discussion of Australian trade policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an unusual statement in that while certainly the first half of the document is in the normal form of relating his experiences and telling the Parliament what he contributed to the various bilateral relations, the second half seems to be an attempt to justify his Government's trade policy. By the time one reads that part of the statement, the result is greater confusion than before reading it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister, with respect, seems to be all over the place on trade at the moment. I presume that he decided that this statement was an occasion to raise the trade issues because he chose his visit to Japan to attack the United States trade policy, and in particular the initiatives of President Bush in Detroit when he was looking at ways in which NAFTA might be linked with other Asian states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some little time ago we decided that it was appropriate to speak in a critical way of certain protectionist policies in the United States, and in particular the EEP policy. We in the Opposition were condemned by the Prime Minister for taking that action. Interestingly, by contrast, at that time he welcomed the speech by President Bush in Detroit, which he said could have a liberalising effect upon trade. That is the position that we had pretty much adopted. But then, strangely, when the Prime Minister left Australia on this trip and reached Japan, he had completely changed his position and, as I said a moment ago, he decided that that was an appropriate time and place to attack the United States on its trade policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said at an earlier time, I cannot think of anything less appropriate for an Australian Prime Minister to do than to enter into what is a very difficult trade debate between Japan and the United States whilst in Japan. I cannot see, anyway, how that could contribute to good relations between Australia and the United States, particularly when we have got ourselves into some difficult trade issues with the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next step in the sequence was the United States expressing concern at the actions taken by the Australian Prime Minister in Japan. No doubt, when one reads this statement it becomes apparent that, reflecting upon those criticisms, the Australian Prime Minister decided that this was an appropriate time to seek to cement the Australia-US trade relationship. And, interestingly, he makes an incredible about-turn and even now speaks in reasonably positive terms about the possibility of bilateral agreements with the United States&mdash;something that until today he had been dismissing out of hand. He says in this statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Government would want to consider seriously any offer of a bilateral agreement with the United States which would reduce import constraints on those items of most concern to us&mdash;particularly beef, dairy products, sugar and steel.</PARA>
<PARA>Until today, he had condemned that approach.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister went on to say that he felt Australia would be unlikely to achieve these concessions. But the point is that unless we try we will never know. That is what we in Opposition have been saying to this Government&mdash;that particularly in the bilateral area the Government ought to be out there trying to gain concessions in a bilateral way. Of course, this Government has put so many of its eggs in the multilateral basket in the hope of achieving a satisfactory outcome in the Uruguay Round of the GATT. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Evans) has come into this place many times and said that that is the ideal and the best solution that is open to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the point is that, if that solution is not being achieved, surely a country such as Australia which so desperately needs to increase its trade should be looking at other less perfect options. As I said, until today the bilateral option&mdash;in particular, the discussions which have revolved around the United States&mdash;has been dismissed by the Prime Minister. But suddenly today we see that it is being embraced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly, the Prime Minister also goes on to look at the possibility of Australia being part of some regional trading arrangement. As far as I can recall, it is the first time that he has floated that idea. He said&mdash;and I guess this is to try to mesh this new approach of his with what the Government previously has been saying and, in particular, with what Senator Evans has been saying&mdash;that perhaps the way to do that is through APEC. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">APEC is already evolving into a regional trade arrangement with a useful agenda of trade-liberalising measures.</PARA>
<PARA>It finally has an agenda of trade liberalisation, but I would have thought that it was premature to be talking about it as a regional trade arrangement. In fact, he continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If thinking and practice in the region evolves towards the idea of a trade pact, we would very much prefer that it be APEC&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the APEC model. The implication in that is that Australia is giving some support to the notion of a trade pact within the Asia-Pacific region&mdash;although APEC, of course, covers an enormous geographical area, far beyond Asia, and, as APEC expands presumably to take in Mexico next year, it would include the whole of North America and Mexico. But certainly for the first time we see the Prime Minister speaking of the possibility of a regional trade pact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line of all this is that the current trade policy position of Australia is very confusing. In his typical style, the Prime Minister sought to attack us, because that is what he does best; in fact, to attack anyone who puts a different position is his preferred approach. But now, being forced into a situation where he has to address what seriously should be Australia's trade policy in a very difficult international environment, and an international environment where the multilateral ground is not achieving the perfect outcome that the Government has sought, he has been forced to look at the sorts of options that we previously had been talking about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I doubt whether an apology from the Prime Minister will be forthcoming, but it is important that this confusing situation he has created be clarified so that Australia, and particularly the Australian investing business community, can understand what is to be this Government's policy in relation to trade during its last few months in office. To the extent that we have at least provoked this Government to start thinking about some other options&mdash;rather than simply relying on, as I said, putting all its eggs in the multilateral basket&mdash;there is no doubt that, from opposition, we have made a worthwhile contribution to this important area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As I have said, that was not the principal reason for my rising. I wanted to address the issue of Cambodia and, in particular, the one page of this statement that the Prime Minister allows for the important question of Cambodia and the major commitment that Australia has made both in manpower, in the size of its defence force commitment, and financially to help the Cambodian people find peace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is disappointing that, on a major issue such as this and in a situation where the Prime Minister has been prepared to visit Cambodia&mdash;and I was pleased to see that&mdash;there is really no thoughtful analysis at all of what is occurring in the country or any detail at all on how Australia is reacting to the difficulties that have been confronted in the Paris peace process&mdash;or, in fact, on what is now the policy of Australia in a changed environment. That is not only disappointing, but it also seems to me to be a breach of an undertaking that was given to this Parliament by both the Prime Minister and the Australian Foreign Minister that we would be kept fully informed of changes that were occurring, particularly changes that might affect the position of our Defence Force commitment. The Government has not done that, and certainly it has not done it by means of this statement, in which, as I said, it allots only one page to the complex Cambodian issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With Senator MacGibbon, who spoke prior to me, I was pleased to have the opportunity to again visit Cambodia, with the support of the Australian Government and the Australian Foreign Minister, before visiting the United Nations some few weeks ago and, in fact, just before the Prime Minister visited Cambodia. I wanted to set foot again on Cambodian soil because I think it is fair to say, certainly from my perspective, that the principal issue that concerns us with which the UN is dealing at the moment is the Cambodian issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no better way to get a clearer impression of that country's affairs&mdash;compared with that which one gets simply from reading the mass media and in the light of the few statements that we get from this Government&mdash;than to have a few days to talk with the faction leaders in Cambodia; to meet with the aid organisations that I have met with before; to meet with the Defence Force people; to meet with Mr Akashi, the Secretary-General's special representative, and other UNTAC officials with various responsibilities; to meet with Lieutenant-General Sanderson, who is heading up the UN military force; and to try to understand the current state of the peace process and what might be the difficulties that it faces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I found those few days particularly worth while and, like Senator MacGibbon, I would like to put on record my recognition of both the professionalism and goodwill of the Australian mission in Phnom Penh. I visit many Australian missions abroad and I was most impressed with the personnel and their attitude in a difficult environment&mdash;and Australia is clearly well respected in Cambodia&mdash;and also the professionalism and dedication of the Australian Defence Force. I was privileged to see them at work and to meet many of them during my short visit to Phnom Penh. They are a credit to Australia in not only their professional standing but also the attitude that they display and the help that they willingly give the Cambodian people beyond the call of duty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, where is the Cambodian peace process at the moment? It seems that, as a result of meetings between the P5, Japan, Thailand, Indonesia, France, Germany and Australia in New York, the Security Council is expected to formally decide this week to proceed with elections no later than the May 1993 deadline as set down in the Paris agreement. I understand from what I read that it is likely to give the Khmer Rouge until 15 November to begin cooperating by outlining a series of measures designed to meet some of what are seen as the more reasonable Khmer Rouge concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These concessions, I understand, are likely to include more administrative power to be shifted from the Hun Sen Government to the UN administration and the SNC. I find it difficult to see how that is going to occur. It coincided with my visit that UNTAC in fact took over the national bank. That area of finance is just one of the five key portfolio areas, and clearly UNTAC is taking considerable responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are those within the states that I mentioned who clearly feel that more effort should be made to appease the Khmer Rouge. It looks as if some further steps might be taken in that direction. I understand that, if the Khmer Rouge does not cooperate by 15 November, the Security Council is then expected to pass a resolution formally declaring the Khmer Rouge outside the process. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister will have the opportunity to respond, because, as I said, the Minister tells us very little about the Cambodian process or Australia's role in it. We tend to hear what the Minister says offshore when briefing the press, rather than what he advises the Australian Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know whether or not sanctions will follow. I was told in Phnom Penh that our Minister&mdash;and this is the embarrassment of it all&mdash;Senator Evans is in favour of sanctions. In fact, Mr Hun Sen said to me that he was pleased at Senator Evans's position in supporting sanctions and hoped that Australia would go further than simply applying sanctions to the Khmer Rouge. He hoped Australia would actually encourage UNTAC to play some peacemaking rather than a peacekeeping or peace-enforcing role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think sanctions would work in relation to the Khmer Rouge. Sadly, I do not think that the application of force is a method to which the Khmer Rouge would positively respond. I understand that the door will be kept open for the Khmer Rouge to rejoin the peace process until about January of next year, being the last possible moment, because parties have to be registered, candidates accepted, roles finalised and so forth. It is my view that, consistent with the philosophy behind the Paris peace agreement that is based on a national reconciliation, that door should be left open as long as possible. I do not think that the Khmer Rouge will cooperate, and I have thought all along that it would not cooperate. However, if the philosophy of the deal is national reconciliation, then obviously the door has to be kept open. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The view seems to be accepted by everyone now&mdash;and it is also my view&mdash;that, with or without the Khmer Rouge, the election should be proceeded with, allowing those who wish to participate to do so and cover as much of Cambodia as possible. That is far from a perfect option, but one should look at the alternatives, one of which is to withdraw. After this commitment, I do not think that would be sensible in terms of the contribution that has been made by the international community, or fair to the majority of Cambodians who really do long for peace. I would rule out that option and there is the other option that I touched on a moment ago of giving the UN force some enforcement role to try to compel compliance with the deal. I do not think that option will work because it is philosophically inconsistent with the Paris agreement. As I said, one of the lessons of history is that the Khmer Rouge does not respond to that sort of force. The third option, and the only one that seems sensibly available, is to proceed with a far less than perfect outcome and at least give those Cambodians who do want to participate in a democratic process the opportunity to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, I understand that Japanese and Thai officials are expected to meet with the Khmer Rouge in mid-October to pursue further the idea of an administrative consultative body to overcome Khmer Rouge concerns about the administration. I do not think that will work. It has been suggested before and they have been working on it for some time. It has not been positively taken up. I have no concerns with the fact that States want to continue to try to find ways to meet the Khmer Rouge objections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that a ministerial level meeting is likely to be held in Cambodia or Thailand at the end of November. That is to be a meeting that will include the SNC, and France and Indonesia will sponsor that. The Minister might provide us with further information during his participation in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are the implications for this evolving situation, which is far different from what was anticipated in the Paris process? It seems that it will mean the UN peacekeeping force will have to remain at full strength up until the elections. We were expecting that the infantry would start to reduce from October to February down to about half its size, because the process of cantonment would have been completed and the need would simply not be there for the current large force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The total peacekeeping force is over 15,000 at the moment, which is tremendously costly. If the force has to remain, there is a further cost implication apart from anything else. The Minister might tell us about that. The original budget was eventually settled at approximately US$1.56 billion. The estimate that I have been given is that, if the full strength of the infantry has to remain, that will be likely to increase to somewhere between US$2 billion to US$2.5 billion extra&mdash;money which of course has not been approved. In fact, I do not think the UNTAC budget has yet been approved beyond October and the Minister might bring us up to date in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The function being performed by the force would also change and that is vitally important. Its role would change to that of seeking to protect the election process in an environment where cantonment has not been successful and, therefore, there are still forces in the field. Clearly, forces of the Khmer Rouge remain in the field. There are those who have not complied with phase two of the agreement and have not met the obligation that they agreed to in France. Also, most of the other forces that have been cantoned have been released on agricultural leave and everyone accepts in any event that only a fraction of their armaments&mdash;particularly their outdated armaments&mdash;have been handed in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We could well be looking at an election environment in which forces from various sections are still in the field who are armed. Whether any would seek to disrupt the process is something that we do not know. However, if they do disrupt the process, having the UN present to try to protect that process is obviously a very different security environment from that to which the Australian Government committed the Australian forces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only point I make in that regard is that I think we are entitled, as we were promised, to know exactly what the situation is from an Australian Government perspective, and so far we have not been told. If the role of the Australian force&mdash;although it is not an infantry component, nevertheless it is in support of the infantry components&mdash;has changed, then the Australian Parliament and the Australian people are entitled to know that as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, we are entitled to know whether the cantonment process is now to be abandoned completely, and whether those who are still within the camps will be released or whether they will try to retain those who have not been let out on so-called agricultural leave within the camps. We are entitled to know whether there is to be any further disarming and, if so, how that is to be carried out and what is to happen to the weapons which have been collected. For example, what if the SOC now seeks to take back its weapons which it has handed in? What is the UN's and the Australian Government's attitude to that? Again it ups the security risk for our forces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are entitled to know whether the SOC military forces will be allowed to play any role in protecting the electoral process. Already there are suggestions from the SOC that it should have that function. Even 15,000 UN forces will be insufficient to protect the electoral process Cambodia wide. Will the Government of Cambodia be allowed to play any role in that regard?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not long, but I want to touch upon some of the other problems that are developing&mdash;the question of refugees for a start. I have to concede that the program of returning people from the camps has been very successful so far. One hundred and fifteen thousand people have been repatriated, but many have not returned to the places it was intended they go and they have tended to rapidly move to the cities. This is creating further problems of urban stress. They are without work and that creates difficulties. So concerns are being expressed about what is happening to the returnees rather than the process of returning them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The law and order situation in Cambodia is deteriorating rapidly and that is a matter of distress. In fact, in many places political violence is now being replaced with what one might call civil violence, and that breakdown of law and order is affecting the whole process and morale. The environment is bad, particularly in the Khmer Rouge controlled areas. Enormous parts of the country are being exploited without any concern for the environment at all, and that is distressing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The economy is collapsing and that is perhaps the greatest worry of all. Now the UN is being blamed because it has developed a dual economy&mdash;the local currency and the dollar economy on top of that. Some estimates of inflation are up to 130 per cent, so we are moving towards an electoral process in which the Hun Sen Government is virtually bankrupt. Some are even wondering whether it can remain in office in the period up to the election, so bad is the economic position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What that means is that the international community is moving towards an election process not only in a situation inconsistent with the Paris agreement but also in an environment that has changed and deteriorated very rapidly&mdash;deteriorated in terms of the collapsing economy and the growing law and order problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we may well see is an outcome in which an election process takes place which is more or less democratic involving some Cambodians. A fragile coalition government is the most likely outcome of that process&mdash;between factions that basically do not get on, against a background of economic collapse and deteriorating law and order problems and with the Khmer Rouge sitting on the outside waiting for that collapse to occur and the opportunity, therefore, to seize power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not see any alternative to that, so I am not being unduly critical of it. The Minister raises his eyebrows, but what I am saying is that the Australian people are entitled to know what the picture is and the background against which we are making our commitments&mdash;and it is a very difficult background. It seems to me that the international community is going to be called upon for an ongoing commitment to nation building post-election. Any thought this would simply be a short term commitment on the part of the international community to help Cambodia through a difficult phase has now, I think, been demonstrated to be unreal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Cambodians are to have any hope of long term peace, any hope of stability, any hope of keeping the Khmer Rouge out and avoiding the atrocities that occurred in the past, then there is no doubt in my mind that the United Nations and the international community generally are going to be called upon for a long term commitment of nation building. No doubt this will be at great cost, but we should understand that that is going to be the reality of the matter and that this electoral process that is taking place should be seen as but a phase in the total development of peace and stability and greater hope for the Cambodian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very difficult picture. Certainly more of the country is at peace now than previously and that is something the majority of Cambodians commend. However, the picture for the future is highly uncertain and, in accordance with the undertakings that the Prime Minister and the Foreign Affairs Minister gave the Australian Parliament, it is time in my view that a full and comprehensive statement was again put down in this place setting out the background to the peace process and Australia's commitment in contemporary terms and what the role of the Australian force will be in the months between now and the anticipated elections in May. I thank the Senate for the opportunity to make those comments on the Cambodian matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to respond briefly to the parliamentary statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on his visit to Japan, Singapore and Cambodia. The Australian Democrats welcome that statement. It is clear from the visit, as it is from this statement, that, in contrast to his former overseas trip to Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, the Prime Minister did not call into question aspects of our national identity in front of non-Australian audiences. This time, he decided that it was time to talk Australia up rather than down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of the visit was concerned with vital issues of trade and the Australian Democrats are pleased to see that APEC has been given greater recognition in the region and that Japan is supporting it. Generally, we support the greater orientation towards Japan and the Asia-Pacific region that the Prime Minister has initiated, in part as a counterweight to the treatment we have received from the United States and from the European Community on wheat and other trade issues. If there was one message in those events, it was clearly that Australia needed to establish a different base from which to operate in trade areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there are also security issues involved in the Prime Minister's visit and in his statement. As the Prime Minister's statement says, the regional security outlook is generally favourable, but less predictable than before. As everyone knows, the region is no longer divided into two hostile camps each with its own commander. The Cold War has ended, leaving what some see as a vacuum of military power into which countries such as Japan and China might move. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would be amazed to find that any other country in this region wants another Big Brother to dominate with military power. That is why the Australian Democrats are convinced that there is no alternative but to fill the vacuum and provide predictability with some new security arrangements. We do not need more military alliances and a continuing military build-up which invites future conflicts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we do need is an all-inclusive diplomatic forum to oversee the development of a cooperative security environment in which the threat of substantial conflict is minimised. This is not a romantic wish for regional peace and harmony. It is instead a hard-headed recognition that the prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region depends on resolving conflicts without bloodshed and reducing the criminal waste of resources on military forces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot afford to let regional security take the path of arms races and nationalistic campaigns for access to marine resources such as the Spratly Islands. We need to take control and set new directions. The Government has responded to this need only in the area of trade, and APEC, as I have said before, is laudable as far as it goes but more is needed. We do need a regional forum concerned with resolving and preventing conflicts and with a reduction of military forces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government dabbled with this idea in 1990 when Senator Evans proposed a conference on security and cooperation in Asia. He was very firmly smacked on the wrist by James Baker, then President Bush's Secretary of State, and beat a hasty retreat with the help of the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke. In the Democrats' view, it is time to refloat the conference on security and cooperation in Asia. We cannot afford to go on drifting in this sea of unpredictability. If we do not seize the opportunity provided by the relative calm we are now enjoying, it will be too late to seek a safe harbour when the inevitable storm blows up. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The visit by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to Japan, Singapore and Cambodia was very successful. This can be measured by the statements of foreign leaders while he was there, the reporting in the media, both in the countries he visited and that which came back to Australia, and in the subsequent feedback that I have been receiving constantly through diplomatic and related channels about the reverberations that the visit has caused and the very positive response that has been felt in the region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of reasons for this. We have in Prime Minister Keating someone who both is and was perceived by his interlocutors to be someone who is very alert to the processes of change that are at work in the region. Both economically and in the larger security context that Senator Spindler canvassed, he is someone who is full of ideas about how to respond to these changes. He has very clear ideas about the role of both our country and the countries that he has visited in this respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, we have a Prime Minister whose personal style was greeted with great enthusiasm by the Asian leaders with whom he spoke, not only on this trip but on the preceding one to Indonesia as well. Mr Keating's rather legendary status as an aggressive parliamentary performer had undoubtedly created something of an advance reputation for him. But people were able to appreciate a side of Mr Keating that we in government in Australia are very familiar with but which has been perhaps less conspicuously reported in those countries, and that is of someone who is polite and deferential, who listens and who is very conscious of the very kind of personal relationships that are involved in developing not only a formal rapport but also a very genuine personal rapport with the leaderships of the country in question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A third reason for the success of these visits is that the Prime Minister has been speaking on behalf of a country which is no longer perceived in the region as some kind of observer of regional events with its heart and emotions elsewhere, but a country that is genuinely committed to and engaged in the region and with a mounting track record of performance to prove it. I guess that the most conspicuous recent examples of that are our initiation of the Asia-Pacific economic cooperation process and the role that we played in producing the UN peace plan for Cambodia and its implementation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will also mention, with particular reference to Senator Spindler's remarks, the role that we have been playing in recent years as a promoter of ideas about the kind of shape that regional security might assume in the post Cold War world. In that environment, superpower relationships do not have the same kind of overarching significance that they used to. It is a much more fluid and dynamic environment and there is a much greater need for cooperative, interdependent, common security approaches to emerge and prevail. Australia's role in promoting that kind of dialogue on these issues, in particular through the forum of the ASEAN ministerial dialogue conference, has been widely recognised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Japan, the emphasis was on the economic relationship, but by no means only on the economic relationship. I will return later to the question of trade policy as one of the themes that ran through the entire visit and which is the subject of some further explicit remarks by the Prime Minister in his statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More generally, in Japan, the message very clearly emerged of countries that have an enormous amount to offer each other, not only in terms of the traditional commodity trade relationship, where the Australian supply of raw materials has been an absolutely crucial factor in the modernisation and industrialisation of that country and is recognised as such, but also, much more generally, a more broad ranging, mature and diversified economic relationship combined with a political relationship that really has a synergy about it. Japan is looking for ways of playing a role politically in the region and, indeed, in the world that is more commensurate with its economic authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Japan has been subject to a lot of misunderstanding in the region and elsewhere in the world. It is a country that values the kind of relationship that a country like Australia can have with it in terms of a number of commonly shared values and a willingness to address global and regional issues in a way that recognises the significance of Japan's role. It is anxious to find a way to exercise that role in a constructive way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not go into all the chapter and verse of what this means in a specific policy context. I simply make the point that this theme is one that has been emerging, in my experience, in the dialogue process that we have been conducting at regular intervals with Japanese Ministers through the vehicle of the Australia-Japan Ministerial Council. This kind of theme was much more overtly on the table, as these things often are, as a result of the Prime Minister's visit. That is to be welcomed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have much to offer each other in terms of working together in multilateral forums&mdash;such as the United Nations conferences on disarmament and the OECD&mdash;vehicles, agencies and forums, both economic and political. We have much to offer by working closely with each other in regional forums such as APEC on the economic side and ASEAN-PMC on the security side. We have much to contribute to the health and prosperity of each other through closer bilateral ties. That is being increasingly recognised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Singapore, we have the consolidation of a relationship that has been traditionally one of the oldest and closest of Australia with the region, by virtue in particular of the Commonwealth tie as supplemented by arrangements such as the five-power defence arrangements, which have really created a very close working and policy relationship between the two countries. Mr Keating's visit symbolised the importance that we not only traditionally associate with that relationship but which we continue to attach to it in an environment where Singapore's growth and sophistication continue to be the real envies of the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, in Cambodia, the Prime Minister's visit, although short, served a very important symbolic purpose by demonstrating the degree of the commitment of Australia not only to try to resolve once and for all the appalling problem of Cambodia but also as a sign of our commitment to the region and our willingness to engage very actively in trying to help solve the region's problems. This is perhaps not the occasion to go into a very detailed discussion of the present Cambodian situation, as Senator Hill invites me to do, but I will try to respond to his invitation by summarising the situation in that country as the Prime Minister found it in his visit and as I would describe it following the very intensive series of discussions that I have had in the last couple of weeks in New York, in particular at the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consensus that presently exists in the international community or among those countries that are most closely involved in the resolution of the problem can be put as follows. In the first place, it is accepted that the UN already has a great many achievements to its credit in the operation of the UN plan. Notwithstanding some of the ongoing pessimism of the reporting about the situation in Cambodia, there are many good things to report. Senator Hill acknowledged some of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The repatriation program, which has now brought back 150,000, not just 115,000, people from the border camps into Cambodia, has been a conspicuous success. It is unfair to say that it has just resulted in people flooding into the cities. They have been going to many parts of the country, although certainly not to the outlying rural areas on the scale that had been hoped. That is something that has to be addressed over time if the balance of the whole economy is to be maintained, and that is acknowledged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The organisation for the electoral process has been proceeding very well indeed, with the process well positioned to meet the April-May timetable next year, subject to constraints that I will come to in a moment. The administration to particularly promote, advance and protect human rights values in the country has been working, by all accounts, very well. The civil administration component of the UN Administration, one of the unique features of this whole current exercise, has been working reasonably well, if not to the satisfaction of all the factions within Cambodia or completely to the satisfaction of the international community. My own view is that a little more might be able to be done in that respect by way of a more visible and substantial presence of UN experts in the key ministerial areas. That is a matter that is currently under further consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some aspects of the situation which are not so good. The economic situation is certainly very fragile, with inflation accelerating, and there are some very real concerns about the ability of the economy to hold itself together, particularly in the absence of major injections of funds from the international financial institutions which have been holding back, pending the resolution of some of the political problems that remain unresolved. There is an emerging law and order problem being dealt with very professionally by the civilian police, no more so than via the Australians of whom Senator Tate spoke today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is only a handful of them and there is a law and order problem of some emerging significance and that is a worrying aspect of it. Generally, none of this has dampened the general optimism that the Prime Minister felt when he was there and I certainly feel from continuing to talk to the key players involved. A lot has been achieved and much more can be achieved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Militarily, not anything like what we had hoped would be achieved pursuant to the peace plan has been achieved by virtue of the non-cooperation of the Khmer Rouge, the Party of Democratic Kampuchea&mdash;the so-called DK&mdash;in that process. There has been quite a deal of cantonment. There has been quite a draw down in the numbers of troops that are still visibly in the field or in the cantons, owing overt allegiance to one or other of the factions, but it is not to be assumed that that situation will continue in perpetuity with the end of the harvesting season and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, the military situation remains very uncertain, even though cease-fires have largely held. But more importantly, there is a reasonable degree of confidence that a full scale resumption of civil war or a full scale military assault by the DK as the ultimate way of expressing its non-cooperation is quite unlikely. That is the balance of opinion at the moment, based on an assessment not just of intention, which will always remain unclear, but also of capability. If that assessment is right it means that however else the process unfolds and whatever other hurdles we may have to jump along the way in keeping that process intact, it may be that we will not as an international community be confronted with the awful dilemma that would otherwise confront us if there were a full-scale military assault by the Khmer Rouge, raising the awful choice as to whether to simply pack up the UN peace plan and come home, there being no longer a peace to keep, or rather to seek from the international community a different kind of mandate&mdash;a chapter 7 Charter mandate in UN terms&mdash;which would enable the peacekeeping exercise to be turned into a peace enforcement one. It is not something anybody can contemplate with equanimity or confidence as being achievable. We simply have to continue to hope that the situation will not arise. I simply report to the Senate that at the moment, without going into details as to the basis of this assessment, there is a quite widespread and reasonable, in my judgment, degree of confidence that that situation will not arise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To continue with this summary of the present situation, there is a general recognition by the international community most often involved that the situation cannot be allowed to drift. If the election timetable is to be met in April-May next year a number of decision points will arise along the way. For example, as Senator Hill said, we cannot contemplate having an election take place in the Khmer Rouge areas of the country if there has not been a cantonment of the military in those areas, an opportunity for the UN to enter in its civilian administration and for there to be effective campaigning by the other parties. That, for all practical purposes, means that we are talking about not much later than January as the decision point, in effect, for the Khmer Rouge to return to the process so far as those areas are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At some stage the financial situation will produce another kind of decision point because of the need, obviously, to keep UN troops there in full force so long as the military situation remains unresolved and the cantonment, demobilisation and disarmament are incomplete. That will create financial burdens of an unforeseen kind and that problem will have to be addressed. It does not have to be addressed right now because there is a significant budgetary underspend so far as the first few months of the operation are concerned for one reason or another. Transitional funds are, in that context and for that reason, available to take us well into next year before a crunch point arises in that respect and decisions have to be made about the draw down of the second tranche of the already agreed funding and before decisions have to be made about any increase in the overall global funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While there is a recognition that the situation cannot drift and that decision points will arise, that is accompanied next by a recognition that the Khmer Rouge cannot and should not be allowed to hold the whole process to ransom. There is a real determination on the part of the international community to finish the job that has been started and to take the process through to elections at the scheduled time in April-May next year, even if that means that those elections will, if the non-cooperation of the Khmer Rouge continues, have to take place only in 85 per cent of the country and not in the 15 per cent or so that at the moment represents a Khmer Rouge no go area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time again there is certainly a recognition that it would be manifestly desirable if the original plan were able to be adhered to to its full extent. To that extent, the international community is minded to hold the doors open for the resumption of Khmer Rouge cooperation as long as is possible. In that context it is acknowledged further that there may continue to be some areas of grievance expressed by the Khmer Rouge which are legitimate, looked at squarely and only from the point of view of the language of the Paris settlement. To that extent, the Japan-Thailand exercise in trying to identify some ways of accommodating Khmer Rouge concerns about the civil administration side of the process has been thought to be worth some further exploration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is finally a recognition, however, given all of these considerations, that some strong messages need to be sent. There needs to be some formal process set in train whereby some of these threads can start coming together. With that in mind, I would expect the UN this week in its resolution of the Security Council to be, in effect, formally initiating article 29 consultations by the Paris conference co-chairmen. I would be expecting them to identify a further date, perhaps some time later in November, when the Security Council would meet again to reconsider the whole situation in the light of the report coming from those co-chairmen and in the light of the experience in trying to resolve through Thai and Japanese good offices such legitimate grievances as the Khmer Rouge has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would expect there to be some acknowledgment, perhaps tacit, that when the Security Council does meet to reconsider the situation it will need to have at its potential disposal a whole range of policy options and possible measures to deal with that situation. It is in that context that the question of sanctions could perhaps be further looked at, although there are obvious difficulties in making a really effective economic sanctions regime work so far as that Khmer Rouge area of the country is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, in the context of Cambodia, all of this is necessarily a step-by-step process. There is simply no point at this stage in trying to map out a complete blueprint of everything that might happen, every contingency, every fork in the road and every possible response to it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will conclude what I was saying on the subject of Cambodia with just these words. It is very difficult at this stage of the exercise, despite the invitation from Senator Hill, to lay out a full blueprint of everything that might happen in the weeks and months ahead. Australia has been very anxious to encourage a sharply focused exercise in thinking about those alternatives by the international community.  That, indeed, is exactly what I was doing in New York two weeks ago. But we do acknowledge that the process is uncertain. We have to feel our way. It has to be a step at a time, and I will do my best to keep the Senate informed of the steps that do unfold as we work our way, hopefully, towards a durable, peaceful solution in that country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, on the subject of trade policy, I will say just a few things in response to Senator Hill. The Prime Minister's statement very clearly spells out the trade policy issues confronting the country at the moment. It very clearly spells out also the options available to us. There is no real disagreement&mdash;I would have thought and hoped&mdash;as between the two sides of politics that those options are in fact multi-dimensional. We do have to be pursuing simultaneously a global approach to trade liberalisation and a regional or&mdash;that ugly word which is assuming currency&mdash;plurilateral, meaning simply more than bilateral, approach. We also have to adopt a bilateral approach, pursuing trade advantage wherever we can find it; pursuing trade access wherever we can find it; continuing to work away, whatever the larger regimes that might be potentially applicable, at getting access for particular commodities, such as beef, in Japan or Taiwan; and minimising the various restrictions or barriers of a tariff or non-tariff kind that might exist in the way of us achieving such access. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any sensible, rational trade strategy has to adopt all of those three approaches simultaneously. However, I do find it most unfortunate that the Opposition and some other commentators continue to repeat the canard that the Australian Government has been preoccupied with one of those dimensions to the exclusion of the others; that we have put all our eggs in one particular basket, namely that of the GATT round of multilateral or global trade negotiations&mdash;the Uruguay Round. The latest repetition of that line was in Mr Greg Hywood's piece in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> a few days ago. This is very well responded to by John Kerin in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> letter column this morning. In his opening paragraph, he makes the point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I am sure that your American correspondent, Gregory Hywood, is capable of driving down 51st Street, listening to the car radio, thinking about whether Bush or Clinton will win on November 3, scratching his nose, and chewing gum&mdash;all at the same time.</PARA>
<PARA>He then goes on to make the point that, unremarkably, we too are capable of pursuing those particular options. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I defer to Lyndon Johnson for the original proposition, and it was rather less delicately expressed than that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the point needs to be made over and over again that of course we are pursuing a multi-dimensional strategy. That element of multi-dimensionality is what clearly emerges from the Prime Minister's statement today. It is nonsense to say that there has been any degree of confusion or changing of tack in our approach to trade policy as the public debate has unfolded in recent weeks. Of course it is the case that the Prime Minister welcomed the Bush Detroit speech for what it said about trade liberalisation values and principles generally and what, in particular, it said about the virtue of that occurring in an Asia-Pacific regional context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where we took, and continue to take, issue with President Bush is with the notion that trade liberalisation objectives can be most sensibly pursued by a kind of hub and spokes approach&mdash;a multiplicity of bilateral agreements; in particular, bilateral agreements in which the United States is the single common party. We have made it clear over and over again that we do not think it is likely that Australia's national interests could be advantaged by such an approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reasons are set out very succinctly in the Prime Minister's speech. I will summarise them. First, we are not at all sure, given the realities of the trade relationship and the domestic lobbies on key commodities in the United States, that we could negotiate a bilateral agreement in which the benefits to us would outweigh the costs; secondly, there is the geopolitical concern that any embrace of the United States in this kind of context would be perceived very widely around the region as turning our back on east Asia, despite the fact, as the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that it accounts for almost six times more of our exports than the United States</PARA>
<PARA>and, thirdly, there is the concern that any kind of hub and spokes model, while it might unquestionably improve trade access in the region for the United States, may well create additional difficulties for the countries at the end of the spokes in question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Prime Minister has said is that we do have an open mind about the kind of trade arrangements which might have to evolve in a post-Uruguay Round or, worse, a post-Uruguay Round failure environment. We do acknowledge that there are options that we may have to consider in that context which are less desirable options when we look around us at the moment. We have an open mind about those options. We certainly think in a regional context that APEC is the perfect vehicle for trade facilitating agreements and we are actively encouraging the conclusion of such agreements. That is the very exercise which was set in train in Bangkok a few weeks ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to acknowledge that it is less easy to achieve a region-wide, APEC-wide preferential trade agreement of an extended NAFTA kind. Certainly, if such an agreement were to be in prospect, it is one which would have to satisfy a number of criteria&mdash;again, some of which are spelt out in the Prime Minister's speech&mdash;not least that it would not involve any kind of division within the region as between trade allies of Japan and the United States respectively. A region-wide agreement&mdash;whether of a trade facilitating or trade preferential kind, provided it was GATT consistent&mdash;is the preferred option. Sub-regional lesser groupings of individual countries or smaller numbers of them may be something that we have to look at. But there really are a number of considerations and criteria that we would need to take into account in any such exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would need to be satisfied of the sorts of things which Professor Snape is talking about in his report which is shortly to be released in its final form. We would need to be satisfied that such an agreement was genuinely trade creating rather than trade diverting; that it was open in character and capable of accession by other parties; that it had a large core of common, genuine free trade content; and that it was not simply a compilation of essentially restrictive, specific, difficult commodity arrangements between the countries that are party to such an agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are all complex issues. This is not the time to pursue them in any detail. It is the time, however, to make the point, as the Prime Minister does, that we are in a fluid and uncertain trade policy environment. We do need to keep our wits about us. We do need to keep an open mind about the kind of principled agreements that may be possible in our region and, indeed, in the world as a whole. What we do not need, however, is a puppy dog-like embrace of particular options which might be offered, or which we might perceive to be open, with particular allies&mdash;particularly those with whom we trade less than others. We do not want to roll over with feet waving in the air and pink tummy exposed in the way that Dr Hewson seems so inclined to do whenever he has opened his mouth in recent weeks on the subject of trade policy and a bilateral agreement with the United States. Our agenda is larger than that. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>This is the fifteenth report of the Standing Committee of Privileges, concerning a matter raised by a person under Privilege Resolution 5 of 25 February 1988. On 6 October 1992, the Deputy President, Senator Colston, in the absence overseas of the President, referred to the Committee a letter from the Honourable Paul Toose, relating to remarks made by the Minister for Justice, Senator Tate, in responding to a question without notice on 2 December 1991. As Chairman of the Advertising Standards Council, Mr Toose wrote to the President on 24 September, and the matter was referred to the Committee as a submission under Privilege Resolution 5.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Senate on Monday 2nd December, 1991, Senator Jones asked a question of the then Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator Tate, in relation to an article that had appeared that morning in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper. Headlined "Politicians `in the grip of lobbyists'", the article quoted comments made by me when answering the writer's queries concerning aspects of my report, as Chairman, contained in the Annual Report for 1990 of the Advertising Standards Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Apart from my surprise at the vehemence and tone of Senator Tate's answer, I was also concerned that his answer also contained many errors of fact which would have had the effect of seriously misleading the Senate. (See Hansard, pages 3730 and 3731).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 31st March, 1992, with the unanimous support of my Council, I wrote to Senator Tate setting out the correct facts and seeking a withdrawal of his remarks and an apology. The responses I made to the Minister on behalf of the Council and on my own behalf included the following specific denials of the views, actions and role which the Minister ascribed to the Council and to me as Chairman:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)I have not been cast in an adversarial role for many years, and did not make any caricature of lobby groups. I am not and never have been "hostile to representatives of the community view". My Council and I welcome expressions of genuine community views and also those of lobby groups.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)It is not my wish to "vet" those who might come from community groups and voluntary organisations as advisers and lobbyists to Ministers. I have always regarded the selection of Ministerial advisers as the sole responsibility and prerogative of each Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)I have not tried to veto the Minister's nominations for appointments to the Alcoholic Beverages, Cigarette, Slimming and Therapeutic Goods Advertising Code Councils. While the Trade Practices Commission's report referred to in the Minister's answer made some criticism of the situation concerning nominations, it was based on incorrect facts, acknowledged by the then Chairman of the TPC, Professor Baxt. Unfortunately, the necessary corrections were ultimately not made to the report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d)The TPC did not make scathing comments about the lack of accessibility and timeliness in respect of the ASC and Media Council. Indeed the ASC, which operates totally free of cost to the taxpayer, is far more prompt, productive and effective in its work than comparable Government agencies or the Court system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e)While I am Chairman and from time to time spokesman for the ASC and have certain special powers within the ASC, it cannot be said that I "supervise" it. All 16 members of the Council have an equal vote except in a tied vote when I have a casting vote. It is not my function to supervise the advertising industry through the Media Council or otherwise. I certainly have no supervisory role in relation to the Media Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senator's reply of 30th April, 1992 was not only inaccurate, inadequate and unsatisfactory, but it also showed his complete unwillingness to make a further statement in the Senate to correct his misleading comments on 2nd December, 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I was sure that Senator Jones would not wish to be a party to the continuance of this situation, I wrote to him on 9th July, 1992 inviting him to again raise the matter in the Senate "and to seek from Senator Tate a response appropriate to the facts as you now have them."  Senator Jones' reply of 3rd August, 1992 stated that "I have noted your comments and will take the matter up with Senator Tate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I consider that Senator Tate's answer to Senator Jones had the effect of misleading the Senate, as well as being a serious assault on the status of the Advertising Standards Council and on the integrity of myself as Chairman.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee's inquiry into the DNSDC and the Air Force aspects of DLRP focused in part on fire protection measures to be provided. The Committee was advised that all upgrading of existing facilities will, as is economically cost effective, comply with the fire safety requirements of the Building Code of Australia and the Defence Manual of Fire Protection Engineering (FACMAN 2). Some fire safety standards required by FACMAN 2 are more stringent than the BCA because they address the very pertinent issue of strategic risk.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AUSTRALIAN WINE AND BRANDY CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this Bill is to remove uncertainties about the enforcement of laws concerning truth in labelling of wine. In 1989, the Commonwealth Parliament amended the Australian Wine And Brandy Corporation Act 1980 to implement a wine Label Integrity Program. The wine Label Integrity Program was developed at the request of the wine industry and requires wine manufacturers to keep records to support labelling claims of the vintage, variety and region of origin of wine. These records and the stocks to which they relate must also be made available for audit upon request by the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation. The aim of the Program is to ensure truth in labelling and so increase consumer confidence in the reliability of wine label claims. The Program also aims to ensure that all winemakers compete honestly amongst themselves in the marketing of wine.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first Label Integrity Program inspections occurred in the Clare Valley of South Australia in 1990. No breaches of the record-keeping provisions occurred and no instances of fraud were detected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, practice in using the legislation where over two hundred audits have now been conducted has highlighted technical deficiencies which are likely to impair the enforcement of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1980 requires manufacturers to keep Label Integrity Program records, but there is no requirement that the records be accurate and complete. Further, where the Corporation under section 42 of the Act requests a manufacturer to provide Label Integrity Program records the manufacturer must provide the records, even if they are self-incriminating, but the manufacturer is then protected from prosecution should the records disclose false labelling. Thus, there is some doubt whether a successful prosecution concerning false labelling could be launched under the present provisions of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill aims to rectify these deficiencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill does four key things.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First&mdash;where Label Integrity Program records are required to be kept under the Act, clause 39ZAAA makes it an offence to knowingly or recklessly fail to make and keep such records, or to make and keep false, misleading or incomplete records.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Second&mdash;section 42 of the Act, which requires a person to provide information to the Corporation on request and indemnifies the person from prosecution where such information is furnished is amended. The amendment removes the Label Integrity Program provisions from the ambit of section 42 but otherwise leaves section 42 unchanged.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Third&mdash;clause 39ZAA of the Bill provides that where the Corporation requests a person to provide Label Integrity Program records, the person may with reasonable excuse refuse the request. The Bill provides that it is a reasonable excuse for a person to refuse to provide Label Integrity Program records where they are self-incriminating. The aim of these amendments is to enable the Corporation to instigate a prosecution where Label Integrity Program records, provided at the Corporation's request, disclose false labelling of wine, while retaining the right of a person to refuse to provide such records where they are self-incriminating. Where a person chooses, with reasonable excuse, not to provide the records, the Corporation may still exercise its inspection powers to obtain Label Integrity Program records and will be able to use those records to initiate a prosecution. Thus the original intention of the legislation will be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 39ZAC of the Bill enables the Corporation to retain Label Integrity Program records for 60 days or if a prosecution for a label offence is initiated within 60 days, until proceedings and appeals are concluded. A person will be able to inspect or copy the records provided to the Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fourth change in the Bill honours a commitment made by the Government in 1989 to the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. The first of the two amendments involved will enable a person to copy evidence seized by a Label Integrity Program inspector. The second reduces the period of validity of an offence warrant from one month to a maximum of seven days. The Senate Committee had argued that a person ought to be entitled to copy records which were seized by an inspector and that the period of validity of an offence warrant of one month was too long and could unfairly infringe a person's privacy. The Government had agreed to consider the Committee's recommendations in the light of experience in administering the Act and to implement any necessary changes when it was next amended.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will not have any financial impact.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The changes proposed in this Bill are aimed at safeguarding the integrity of our wine industry and have the industry's wholehearted support. The success of our wine industry is reflected in its motto of purity, integrity, quality and economy. This Bill furthers this objective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian winemakers have a 97% share of the domestic market for wine. Exports of Australian wine have soared from $20.5m in 1985/86 to $234m in 1991/92. The industry is aiming for $1 billion of exports per year by the year 2000. Continued export expansion is the key to future growth and prosperity of our wine industry and truth in labelling is the key to consumer confidence in our wines here and abroad.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our wine Label Integrity Program legislation has drawn praise at home and abroad for underpinning the integrity of our wines and for providing the platform for fair trading in wine. The Label Integrity Program is seen as a tough and effective deterrent to fraud. The amendments proposed in this Bill will ensure the legislation can be enforced in the courts and will safeguard our hard-won international reputation for high quality, value for money, true to label wines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to honourable senators and present the Explanatory Memorandum to this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">NATIONAL ROAD TRANSPORT COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill is to amend the National Road Transport Commission Act 1991 to give effect to the Light Vehicles Agreement formulated at the Heads of Government meeting on 11 May 1992. The Agreement involves a regime for vehicles weighing 4.5 tonnes or less, their drivers, other road users and related matters. This will expand the powers and functions of the National Road Transport Commission to include regulation of all motorised vehicles and not just those vehicles weighing more than 4.5 tonnes. In addition, the Commission shall exercise responsibility for policy development for light vehicles, excluding the determination of charges.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the National Road Transport Commission was formally established at the beginning of this year, it was hailed as a major step towards achieving fundamental and lasting reforms of road transport&mdash;reforms which would benefit all Australians as a result of a more efficient road transport industry sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the short time the Commission has been operating, it has achieved significant progress towards the development of uniform charges and technical standards for heavy vehicles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission has earned a reputation for its independence and fairness through extensive formal and informal consultations with industry and Governments. The first recommendations of the NRTC in relation to heavy vehicle charges have been considered and approved by the Ministerial Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The charging determinations have received support from a convincing majority of States. The charges have also received overwhelming support from the road transport industry, the Business Council of Australia and the Transport Workers' Union.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The addition of light vehicles to the terms of reference of the National Road Transport Commission is another significant step towards creating a single national road transport regulatory environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australians are one of the most mobile people on earth. The ability to move freely anywhere in the country is something we consider a fundamental right. Nevertheless, one of the most basic ways through which we enjoy our right of mobility on the ground is governed by a myriad of different regulations. Even to the basics of traffic rules.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In many places on State borders, such as in Albury/Wodonga, Tweed Heads/Gold Coast, and in the Canberra/Queanbeyan region, near neighbours and colleagues who have the same type of car, are subject to different registration requirements, different inspection requirements and differing on road requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The management and development of the regulations covering light vehicles has meant duplication of work amongst the States. The National Road Transport Commission will play a significant role in facilitating and ensuring continued co-operation among the States and Territories to reach a solution to these problems. It will create the basis for a nationally consistent legislative framework which will streamline administrative processes in government bureaucracies across the country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our roads constitute a major asset to this country, but it is also an asset which requires constant maintenance and upgrading. An important function of the Commission will be to assist in the development of indicators which can provide better ways of assessing how we, as a Nation, are coping with this task.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission will collect and publish information on important issues affecting road transport. Information will be assembled and published on the comparative assessment of the performance of road authorities and road systems. This will assist all levels of government by providing a better, more balanced view on the delivery of road funding programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the Commission will monitor the use of alternative fuels and publish information on road safety. The Commission will not pursue uniformity purely for uniformity's sake. In a number of specified areas, it must demonstrate that significant net benefits would arise before developing proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now turn to the individual amendments which are set out in the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principal amendment in the Bill will provide for the inclusion of the Light Vehicles Agreement in a Schedule to the National Road Transport Commission Act. The proposed amendments will expand the terms of reference of the National Road Transport Commission to include a range of issues relating to light vehicles. The Commission will also assemble and publish information on road funding, the taxes and road related charges applying to light vehicles, the performance of our road systems, the effectiveness of road authorities, and on road safety.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other amendments proposed within the Bill cover those areas which make specific reference to issues covered by either the Heads of Government Agreement on Heavy Vehicles or the Light Vehicles Agreement. These amendments do not affect the manner in which the Commission and the Ministerial Council operate, but are limited to clarifying which agreement is referred to.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission is funded through contributions by the Commonwealth and the States based on shares approved by the Ministerial Council. The Commonwealth contribution is 35%. In 1992/93 this amounts to $1.1 million. The financial impact on the Commonwealth of the expansion of the terms of reference of the Commission will be minimal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Successful and lasting reforms which facilitate a better, more efficient road transport environment has been a priority for this Government. The expansion of the terms of reference of the Commission to include light vehicles is certain to bring benefits to all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I expect all governments to continue to honour the commitment by Heads of Government to implement a uniform national road transport registration system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening we are discussing the National Health and Medical Research Council Bill 1992. The aim of this Bill is to establish the National Health and Medical Research Council as a statutory authority. Established in 1936, the Council has become Australia's peak advisory body on public health, health care, health and medical research and health ethics. I join with my colleague Dr Bob Woods in the House of Representatives in offering my compliments to the NHMRC for the work it has done, in particular its promotion of medical research which has put Australia at the forefront of medical research in the world. I believe this is quite a feat, given the size of Australia's population and the size of our medical and allied health research fraternity. We only have to look at the newspapers to see some of the breakthroughs that have occurred in Australia in the area of medical research.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Arguments have been put for and against the NHMRC becoming a statutory authority. In his second reading speech, the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Council deals with issues that are of direct concern to all Australians in one way or another&mdash;from the food we eat to the air we breathe. These issues should continue to be dealt with expertly and impartially, and all citizens should be comfortable in the knowledge that the peak body for advising on these matters is beyond interference. Only statutory independence can ensure that degree of comfort and confidence for the community.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the Minister's point of view, but I do not believe that in his second reading speech he put forward a convincing case for that point of view. On the other hand, those who advocate for the status quo being maintained put forward the view that the NHMRC has operated as an Order in Council for over 50 years and has survived and served the country well; that the NHMRC has maintained a strong independence; and that it is very accountable, more so than many statutory authorities. It reports to Parliament twice a year through its session reports, and the sessions are open to the media. The NHMRC reports annually to Parliament on medical research activities as well. The flexibility of the Order in Council has allowed the organisation to evolve over time and to adapt to deal with new issues as they emerge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NHMRC in 1990 undertook an internal review of the Council and its activities. On page 2, under the heading `Organisation and Structure', the committee carrying out the internal review states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the request of the Minister for Community Services and Health the review paid considerable attention to the question of whether NHMRC should become a statutory authority. Proponents argued the needs for accountability and independence of a body such as the NHMRC could be met properly only through legislation. The review committee was not convinced that this was the case and considered disadvantages associated with becoming a statutory body, such as inflexibility and increased costs, outweighed the advantages.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the view of the internal review committee. I bet it laboured hard and long over the phrasing of this paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accepting the Minister's intention to proceed with legislation, the review committee has proposed a model with the following main features:</PARA>
<PARA>One of the committee's roles was to review the whole body, and it was hamstrung by the fact that it had to operate within the constraints of accepting the Minister's intention to proceed with the legislation. I would love to have been a fly on the wall while they drafted that little paragraph. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the view of the internal review committee. But no, the Minister seems to think that it is much better if the NHMRC becomes a statutory authority. As I said, the internal review committee was not convinced that it should become a statutory authority, the Minister did not convince them, nor has he convinced the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Council will still be dependent on the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services, and it will still be subject to government intervention. I do not believe that the establishment of the NHMRC as a statutory authority will change this. The coalition is not convinced that legislation will lead to a stronger body. We believe it will lead to the continuation of potential conflicts of interest and other problems, especially in terms of the ethical committees of the NHMRC, and we believe that this issue needs to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Health Ethics Committee is responsible for the ethical review of medical research and clinical practice and the formulation of related guidelines. There is a concern that there is a potential for conflict of interest in having an ethics committee as part of a body whose major function is to promote research. I do not think it takes much to understand that a body which is promoting research will have problems if the Ethics Committee has concerns about a particular approach to or direction of research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might just say here that I was undertaking some research at the Queen Victoria Medical Research Centre measuring foetal movements in pregnant mothers&mdash;I do not suppose you would measure them in anything but pregnant mothers, if you were doing human research&mdash;looking at the ways in which we might be able to detect foetuses at risk.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I happened, by chance, to be at the Queen Victoria Hospital when some of the early IVF research was being undertaken there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> With my background in psychology I was concerned with the research on some of the projects that were being undertaken that really had not been scrutinised totally by the public. The person with whom I was working there, Professor William Walters, and I had long discussions about some of the research projects. His concern was such that it led him to write a book jointly about the ethics of IVF, and to raise some of the issues in the public arena. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I still have mixed reactions to some of that research. I think it is important that those issues, which are very complex, are not impeded by a conflict of interest. That debate should go on free and unfettered because it is really right at the cutting edge of our concept of what we see of ourselves as human beings. I saw people wrestling with that in that program at the Queen Victoria Hospital. In fact, some of them who are involved were challenged to argue to the roots of their intellect with themselves and with others about the direction that their research was going in. It was interesting to be there at that time, seeing that research starting off in its embryonic stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister. Seeing the hassles and the challenges that they were facing in being at the forefront of that research, was a valuable experience for me. I could see the challenge that it also posed to the newly formed ethics committee at the Queen Victoria Hospital, and again, the problem with the hospital being involved in judging the research of its own researchers. I believe that it is vital for that process to be separated so that the debate can go on, as I said, as free and unfettered as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Select Committee on the Human Embryo Experimentation Bill also called for the separate establishment of the Human Ethics Committee as a statutory authority. I believe Senator Tate, the Minister responsible for the passage of this Bill in the Senate, chaired that Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have referred to the Senate Community Affairs Committee the question of the separation of the ethical component of the NHMRC to a separate body, and whether it should be a statutory authority or whether it should take some other form. The coalition at this stage is of the opinion that it should be separate and completely independent. The Committee will be seeking information and evidence from a number of people who will make submissions to it on Friday. I guess that leaves that aspect of the Bill to the committee stage after we have met on Friday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before concluding my short speech on this Bill this evening I cannot pass over an article that appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> yesterday, when we are debating the NHMRC. It is headed `Lab Labours Lost'. It is about a problem that has been identified in the current Budget where the Government thought it was granting a rise to medical research. I do not know whether the figures are right here&mdash;one should never believe everything one reads in the newspapers&mdash;but the article claims that because of the changes to employer-funded superannuation, the NHMRC has had to contribute an extra $1m for researchers, and that that money has had to come from the research budget. Mark Ragg's article also claims:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But far worse than that, a miscalculation in last year's allocation meant that the NH&amp;MRC received more money than the strict formula used by the Department of Finance said it should. The NH&amp;MRC, like both government departments, was unaware of the error. It allocated the money and committed scientists to ongoing projects.</PARA>
<PARA>One has to understand how the NHMRC works. It may grant a project for so many years, so you get all the researchers on line, employ the staff&mdash;especially young postgraduate research students&mdash;and the project is up and running. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now that money has been withdrawn from this year's allocation, leaving the NH&amp;MRC obliged to support last year's grants and with significantly less money to distribute to new projects than in previous years. The result, according to eminent medical researchers, is a disaster.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Professor John Chalmers, a former chairman of the NH&amp;MRC, past president of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians and currently dean of medicine at Flinders University, estimates that almost a third fewer new projects will be funded this year than in previous years.</PARA>
<PARA>He also says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But because of this cut in funding, about 100 new research projects in heart disease, cancer, molecular biology, AIDS, infectious diseases, mental health, women's health and Aboriginal health are going to miss out.</PARA>
<PARA>Mark Ragg goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Efforts to obtain a response from the Minister for Health, Brian Howe, for this story have been unsuccessful. But Howe is known to have written to the Minister for Finance, Ralph Willis, in an attempt to sort out the error. The letter is said to have been along the lines of "There has been a mistake and what should be a rise is actually a cut in funding. Can we sort it out?" It is believed that the NH&amp;MRC will get an answer by the end of this week.</PARA>
<PARA>I hope the NHMRC gets an answer by the end of the week. We cannot afford to tinker and have errors like this amongst our medical research community. The calls to other countries, especially the United States&mdash;the lures that are held out to them&mdash;are very, very attractive. We are seeing some of our best medical researchers leave our shores because they cannot continue their research; because there is uncertainty in funding; because there is a lack of continuity; and because of these sorts of errors; and because of the lack of thinking through of the implications of the employer superannuation guarantee. It has left the NHMRC and the funding of medical research in a parlous state unless the Minister gets an appropriate answer from Mr Willis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I call on the Minister here, the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button), to ensure that something is done to correct the problem that seems to have existed. I am sure that medical researchers and all of those of us who benefit from the outcomes of Australian medical research are concerned about these issues, and more concerned about them than whether or not the NHMRC is a statutory authority. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The National Health and Medical Research Council Bill 1992 provides legislative recognition for the National Health and Medical Research Council and makes it into a separate statutory authority. At present the NHMRC exists by virtue of an Executive order, which is a fairly precarious basis for existence. Giving the NHMRC a legislative basis as a statutory authority puts it on a more secure footing but, perhaps more importantly, it also improves the ability of Parliament to scrutinise the Council's operations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find the Opposition's attitude a little confusing. On the one hand, it is arguing that there should be greater parliamentary scrutiny of the conduct of the Council&mdash;especially in the ethics area&mdash;but on the other hand, it does not seem to want to support legislation which provides the opportunity for that scrutiny. Certainly, the NHMRC should be independent and I cannot see that this Bill threatens or undermines that independence in any way. However, it is surely desirable for the Council to operate under an Act which can be scrutinised and, if necessary, amended by the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have certainly been many concerns expressed over the years from a variety of quarters about the way in which the NHMRC conducts its affairs. It is probably fair to say that the major criticism has been about the Council's lack of public accountability and also its unwillingness to accept that, alongside its medical research role, it also has a  responsibility to the broader community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the climate at the NHMRC has changed and is changing.For a start, as this Bill confirms, representation on the Council is much broader and is no longer quite so heavily dominated by medical researchers or the medical and scientific professions. We now have nominees on the Council from: the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission; the trade union movement; tertiary education bodies specialising in health care training; business organisations; the nursing profession; consumer groups; social welfare organisations; and the environmental movement. In addition, following representations from the Public Health Association of Australia, the Australian Democrats advised the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services that we would move amendments to put on the Council a representative of organisations with expertise in broad public health issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister, as he stated in his closing remarks in the House, indicated he was prepared to accept our amendment. However, I note that a very similar amendment was moved and passed in the House of Representatives and, accordingly, we will not be proceeding with our amendment here. So, basically, we now have a wide range of interests represented on the Council and this appears to be having the effect of ensuring that the NHMRC does not confine itself only to narrow medical and scientific concerns. Further, having such a broad range of experience on the Council also brings a much higher degree of community scrutiny to its work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill also contains provisions for a basic consultation process prior to the Council making any recommendations or issuing any guidelines. It also sets up a complaints process, including the establishment of a Commissioner of Complaints, in relation to decisions the Council makes about funding medical research. What all this means is that the NHMRC is becoming a much more accountable organisation. It is more open to input from the general public and community and consumer organisations and is no longer under the dominance of medical researchers. It is more receptive to broad public interests and ethical concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am aware that there are still critics of the Council who feel it remains beholden to industry, economic and medical research interests at the expense of wider community concerns. But I think it is also clear that the old days of the NHMRC are well and truly gone. We should acknowledge the changes that have taken place and congratulate the NHMRC on its progress towards improved accountability and better understanding of its community responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to three specific concerns that we have. No doubt these will be covered in far more detail on Friday when we reach the Committee stage. It has been suggested to me by several organisations and individuals that the Bill really falls down in providing adequate parliamentary scrutiny of the Council's activities. There is, of course, a need to allow the Council to function independently, set its own goals, make its own plans and develop its own strategies. However, there is also a need to ensure that the Council is accountable. After all, its work is of critical significance and it frequently deals with issues that are of great community concern and enormous community interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, there has been a great improvement in the way the Council operates, but I think we should examine whether there is a need for more formal parliamentary scrutiny within this legislation. For example, I note that any ministerial directions to be given to the Council under clause 9 of the Bill are not disallowable. Similarly, the Council's strategic plans are not disallowable, although they must be tabled in both houses of Parliament. Any guidelines the Council issues are also not subject to parliamentary approval or disapproval. There is a fine balance to be struck between giving an organisation like the NHMRC the capacity to operate flexibly and independently and subjecting it to parliamentary scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is, of course, true to say that Parliament&mdash;although in theory representing the community&mdash;is not necessarily an accurate reflection of community attitudes and it is certainly far from being the fount of all wisdom when it comes to medical and ethical issues. However, there is cause to look at improving the parliamentary scrutiny of the Council and this is an issue that I will be pursuing when the Committee examines the Bill on Friday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second area of concern I have is with the complaints process. It is certainly a step in the right direction, but it deals only with decisions about funding and I think there is some scope for widening the grounds for complaint. For example, it seems to me that it should be possible for the subjects of the NHMRC funded research to make a complaint about the way the research was carried out or how they were treated, or how the information they were given was relevant, and so on. I ask the Minister whether he will give consideration to that suggestion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third area of concern covers what probably is the most controversial area, that is, the ethics component of the NHMRC. The Bill confirms the Australian Health Ethics Committee as a principal committee of the NHMRC. The AHEC is charged with drafting broad ethical guidelines on matters which it can either initiate itself or have referred to it by the Minister, the general community or the Council. At present, we have a two-tiered approach to ethics, with the NHMRC Committee operating on the national level and various institutional ethics committees operating locally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the years, there have been numerous calls to separate the functions of the ethics committees from the NHMRC and establish an independent ethics authority. I accept that there is some potential for conflict between the NHMRC's roles and I see that there are some very genuine concerns. However, I also feel very strongly that we should not eliminate the in-house ethical scrutiny of NHMRC projects. Even if we do establish an independent ethics authority, we still need to have an ethics body within the Council because there is quite clearly a need for medical and scientific research to maintain very close ties with ethical issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I must also say that it is far from clear to me just what people mean when they talk about an `independent' ethics authority. I suspect that some of them are just after a body that will represent their own views. Some of those who have not been happy with the AHEC and its predecessor, the National Bioethics Consultative Committee, are after something that reflects quite a different approach to ethical issues&mdash;perhaps on religious grounds, perhaps from some philosophical viewpoint. That is fair enough. I am not arguing that that is in any way improper. But we surely have to ask: who would be on such an independent body if these groups and organisations were to have the say as to who was to be appointed? After all, the calibre of the decision making of any authority or committee still relies upon the quality, beliefs, experiences and values of those people who actually make up its membership&mdash;the expertise of its members. There is absolutely no guarantee that a so-called `independent' ethics authority would be any better or any worse than what we have within this Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have to recognise that many ethical issues are simply not resolvable. The debate about them continues on and on, and we will not get to a situation where everybody is happy. They may be issues about which people have very strong views, based perhaps on their personal philosophy or, as I said before, on specific religious beliefs. These people will not change their views and they will not change their behaviour just because any ethical body tells them that they have to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people who have commented on this Bill have also called for an independent authority to be subject to very close parliamentary scrutiny and control. Again, I understand this point and I accept it. But I have to say again that there is no reason to suppose that parliamentarians either have any better understanding of the issues than anyone else or, in this case, will accurately reflect the views of the community. It could be argued that medical research matters are running ahead of the community's understanding of ethical issues, and some issues would be far better looked at and more appropriately addressed by far greater community participation in the decision making process within ethics committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, generally, I am far from convinced that the establishment of an independent ethics authority would take us any further towards a satisfactory resolution of the difficult ethical dilemmas facing us. However, I think the concerns being raised are valid ones and that the issue certainly deserves some more examination and exploration. As I said earlier, I think this Bill should be passed. The NHMRC should have an in-house ethics committee. I also believe that the Standing Committee on Community Affairs should look at these issues when it examines the Bill on Friday. It should also take into account the way in which appointments are made to the in-house ethics committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats believe that Parliament should be taking a closer look at the whole issue of the need or otherwise for an independent ethics authority. Therefore, I intend to move that the matter be referred to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. I will not read out the entire motion. Very briefly, the motion asks the Committee to look at the current relationship between the Australian Health Ethics Committee and the various institutional ethics committees throughout the country; the particular requirements for ethical guidelines in relation to the conduct of medical research involving humans; and the optimum legal structure for any such independent ethics authority, the membership of and the method of appointing people to such an authority, and the relationship between that authority and Federal Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the Government and the Opposition to support this motion when it comes before the Senate. I shall defer moving the motion for a few days to give honourable senators time to look at the precise wording and to make sure that we have something that all parties are happy with and will agree to support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the Australian Democrats believe that this Bill correctly gives the NHMRC legislative backing. While we do want further exploration of the need for an independent ethics body, we feel that there also has to be an ethics body within the Council itself. For these reasons, although we do see that there is a need for some improvement to the legislation, the Democrats will be supporting the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The key issue that is confronting this Parliament in respect of the National Health and Medical Research Council Bill 1992 is: do we believe that the ethical guidelines governing medical research promoted by a body named the National Health and Medical Research Council should be determined by that same Council? That is the key question that we are confronted with in this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any thinking, reasonable person&mdash;irrespective of religion, as suggested by Senator Lees&mdash;would say, `No, that is a conflict of interest'. It is not proper, it is not ethical, for the body which promotes medical research to be the same body that determines the ethical guidelines governing that research. Yet, it appears that Senator Lees is prepared to vote for this legislation, which does precisely that. That, in my view, is unethical; in my view it is undemocratic; and in my view it challenges the whole concept of equity and fairness in human endeavour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like Senator Patterson, I want to say that the National Health and Medical Research Council has done a number of very fine things. Much of its research has been properly and effectively targeted. Hundreds of people have been engaged over a long period in assessing applications for research funds. It must be borne in mind that the NHMRC is responsible for about, I think, only 25 to 30 per cent of the funds allocated for medical research in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been occasions, however, when the National Health and Medical Research Council has seriously bungled and promoted certain types of research which were neither medical research nor research appropriate for that body to fund. I refer, of course, to the occasion on which the National Health and Medical Research Council funded to the tune of $450,000 over a three-year period a project at Monash University for the development of a philosophical approach to experimentation on human embryos and gametes. Might I say&mdash;and Senator Lees should listen to this&mdash;that that project failed to meet the scientific benchmark for the approval of applications that year; it failed to meet that standard. What did the National Health and Medical Research Council do on that occasion? It said, `We will fund it anyhow; we will fund it on a special initiative grant'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In those years there were something like 300 applications which met the scientific standard, but were not provided with the funds. However, the project to which I referred was provided with $450,000 of taxpayers' money. The average amount of medical research grants is, I suspect, around $12,000 to $15,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is most important to understand what we in this chamber are faced with. We are faced with the need to acknowledge that a conflict of interest arises where a body which promotes medical research determines the ethical guidelines for that medical research. On the one hand there is a commitment to the technological imperative and, on the other hand, there is the need to sit back and assess independently whether that medical research should take place. I will quote from Robert Moser, MD, who in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Technological Explosion in Medical Science</EMPHASIS> had this biomedical credo, which is what we are faced with:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">[The technological imperative] is the unquenchable spirit and relentless desire to explore and expand knowledge to the ultimate, to invent the uninvented, to discover the undiscovered, to create the uncreated. And the devil take the consequences. No power on earth can stop the mind of man. . . The single-minded dedication to pursuit of truth most often casts aside or ignores all external considerations. . . the scientist hot on the trail of new knowledge. . . is not inclined to reckon with the social or political or economic implications of his potential discovery. . . the Manhattan Project was accelerated by momentous historical events, but many scientists were fascinated by the chase, per se. For them the potential for a nuclear Armageddon was thrust aside as a momentary dark reflection. . . In similar vein, a like phenomenon is occurring in genetic engineering. The scientists who entered the fearsome lists of hybrid creativity paused only momentarily to reflect on the social, moral, and political implications. Then they. . . plunged ahead in their relentless pursuit of new biologic forms. Now the research is continuing with unprecedented rapidity. Efforts are abroad to sever all regulatory restraints. A few nervous religious ethicists continue to scratch their heads in concern, but. . . I suspect that even those anxious individuals. . . had ever joined forces to create laws to inhibit genetic engineering, the intellectual imperative would have prevailed; the laws would have been circumvented or violated, and the research would have continued. . . We can tether the giant of technology,. . . but we will never stop the inspired investigator. . . . He will defy politics and economics and threats of physical harm. He will work in basements and garrets. He will plead for or purloin equipment to pursue his star. . . to others he whispers: `We have no time for your puny politics or social concerns. . . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do we do when faced with that situation? Should we continue the situation whereby the Australian Health Ethics Committee is a subcommittee of the National Health and Medical Research Council?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, that cannot continue one moment longer.

The issue of guidelines by the National Health and Medical Research Council for the establishment of registers of persons and families with genetic disorders is a very important one for the disabled. A person's family name can be on that register without his or her approval. Does anyone in this chamber think that is correct? Does anyone in this chamber deny that that is a violation of the individual's human rights? Given the rapid rate of information and research in this particular area, are we not on the verge of the brave new world?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How many of us read recently of a newly developed test to detect genetic disorders in human embryos merely days after conception? The test carves cells from four- or eight-celled embryos, to identify genes for cystic fibrosis, for the purpose of discarding individuals deemed to be imperfect. That was announced in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New England Journal of Medicine</EMPHASIS> only last month. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This system of genetic screening is an ethical minefield involving questions of the genetic composition of future humans, questions of privacy, destructive experiments on human embryos and the status of the disabled. The disabled in fact have fought long and hard against discrimination and to be recognised as equal. We have recently been debating the second reading of the Disability Discrimination Bill. That Bill has been to a Committee. Would it not be ironic if we were to allow to continue the situation whereby the National Health and Medical Research Council can approve, without reference to Parliament, guidelines for the establishment of registers of persons and families with genetic disorders in such a manner where an individual can have his or her family name on that register without his or her permission?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The test to which I referred, and indeed which would be authorised by the National Health and Medical Research Council's guidelines on human experimentation, was done in America but could be done in Australia by scientists funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council under its own human experimentation guidelines. It can be done here. The development of that test to detect and eradicate the genetically unfit is an insult to the disabled. It has grave ramifications for their status in our society. It is about genetic discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a small group of powerful medical elite&mdash;I am certainly not tarring all with the same brush&mdash;who are about weeding out those that they deem imperfect. Where will it end? Will those deemed as having a genetic disposition to being fat or short-sighted be eliminated? Who will decide? It hit me when I read in an overseas report that a further investigation was being made to develop DNA probes which would be able to be used to detect in the early human embryo susceptibility of that individual to a whole range of disorders ranging from Alzheimer's disease to cancer. That really hit me because my first wife died of cancer and my mother had Alzheimer's disease. Once it is brought down to those specific individual examples, one sees how it can affect us all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people might say, `It would be better off if he wasn't here'. That may have been a possibility if that particular test was developed a little over 50 years ago. So it has everything to do with the people of Australia and each individual person in Australia. Therefore, it is one of the key and important questions to be dealt with by this Parliament. We can deal with all sorts of things in this Parliament, but this is one of the key issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this legislation we are now saying that the Parliament has no say at all.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe we would be failing in our duty if we were not to challenge this and not amend this legislation or throw it out. It has been said by Senator Lees&mdash;echoing what Minister Howe said in his speech in the other place&mdash;that this Bill makes the NHMRC more accountable to Parliament. It does no such thing. Senator Lees can say, `If this is an Act of Parliament we will be able to amend the Act'. After 30 June 1993! She must be kidding. It would need the support of whatever Government is in power at that stage because no matter how we amend the legislation in this place, it has to be passed by the House of Representatives where the Government has the numbers. If the Government does not see fit to do anything, the legislation will not go through and Senator Lees knows that. It will not do anything to make that body accountable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now foreshadow certain amendments to this legislation. I will ensure that Parliament has a say and that the Australian Health Ethics Committee is made accountable to this Parliament.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second amendment that I will move is in respect of the last two clauses of the National Health and Medical Research Council Bill. The penultimate clause in the Bill entrenches in legislation the unsatisfactory guidelines established by the National Health and Medical Research Council in respect of human embryo experimentation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are debating the National Health and Medical Research Council Bill 1992. This Bill raises some important and very complex issues, as my colleagues Senator Patterson and Senator Harradine have just laid out. It is a view of the Liberal and National parties that, firstly, the establishment of the NHMRC as a statutory body falls well into the category of failing a test that should be applied here to all legislation&mdash;that is, whether it achieves any necessary general benefit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the Opposition believes, and it is supported in this attitude by many thoughtful and concerned people who are involved in the question of medical ethics, that it is essential for the Australian Health Ethics Committee to be separated from the National Health and Medical Research Council. That is basically the area that I want to address my remarks to tonight. There are grave concerns not just by some of us on this side of the chamber but by people in the community who are very much concerned about ensuring that there is a separation of the two. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Too often, more legislation is placed on the statute books and more statutory authorities are created for no necessary reason, with the inevitable consequence that eventually there is a greater demand on the public purse. Throughout this debate, the Opposition does not intend to cast any aspersions on the NHMRC, on its general record or on the competence and integrity of its personnel. That is far from the question that we are looking at this evening. I certainly want to make that point clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This in itself begs the question as to why this structural change is considered necessary, when the NHMRC has operated under an Executive order since 1936 and reports regularly to the Parliament. The onus is strongly on the Government to justify change when the review of 1990 concluded that the NHMRC should continue to be maintained by an order of Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The change to a statutory authority does not convey any real enhanced independence for or from government&mdash;the NHMRC will continue to be financially dependent upon the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services&mdash;nor will it have any greater accountability to the Parliament. While the NHMRC has worked well, there has been argument raised to the effect that, in the allocation of finance for research, there is a bias against originality because of decision making within a peer group. This argument may not be valid, but if there is a need for any restructuring of the NHMRC, it makes sense to delay any reconstruction as a statutory authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For these simple and pragmatic reasons, the Liberal and National parties oppose the main object of this Bill. Once again, in advocating that the Australian Health Ethics Committee become a separate institution from the NHMRC, we are not stating that this body has sought to act other than in accord with proper medical ethics; there is no question about that whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, serious questions have arisen as to whether there is not an inherent conflict of interest in having the regulation of medical ethics continue under the umbrella of the organisation that decides on medical research funding. That really needs to be clearly defined. It may well be the necessary function of the AHEC to apply some general brakes on aspects of research rather than simply guide it along agreed channels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very relevant to this debate that the Senate Select Committee on Human Embryo Experimentation, chaired by the present Minister for Justice, Senator Tate, advocated such a separation of the peak body governing medical ethics from the NHMRC. Senator Harradine has already made mention of this Committee and its findings. Certainly there can be questions raised as to the effectiveness of the two bodies that preceded the AHEC when it was formed in 1991. The Medical Research Ethics Committee was formed in 1982 and the National Bioethics Consultative Committee was established in 1988 by the Australian Health Ministers' Conference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The former came under criticism in January 1987 by Professor Hiram Caton for its attitudes towards the question of embryo experimentation, with a dogmatic denial of the humanity of embryos and for the fact that one member expressed indignation that parliamentarians should presume to somehow intimidate IVF researchers. The MREC was seen as having an underlying belief that it must not frustrate research. I suppose that is quite understandable. But the arguments so criticised by Professor Caton are entitled to be expressed within the medical and scientific world but should surely not be enshrined as accepted wisdom in determination of ethics. That is another area of concern and the basis on which a number of these decisions are made. It underscores the point that however well-intentioned, a medical ethics body that is closely tied to medical research will inevitably reflect the priorities and assumptions of researchers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, the NBCC has failed to inspire confidence that it encompasses the full ethical range of the problems raised in genetic research. Thus, in its surrogacy report in April 1990 the NBCC actually dismissed the notion of core ethical values and stated that personal autonomy was the common goal of our society. To say the least, this is a debatable standpoint for any peak body in medical ethics. That is also of great concern to many people in the community. It is a valid point of view but, once again, I do not believe that it can be treated as accepted and received wisdom and therefore must certainly be questioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NHMRC should be commended for its role in sponsoring medical ethics, and can point to the fact that in 1986 it insisted that funds would only be provided to institutions unless their research had been approved by an institutional ethics committee. This led to the institution of 120 such committees. It is not, however, denigrating this achievement in any way to say that it cannot stand as the end of a necessary process. Such in-house committees are inevitably limited by shared goals, assumptions and priorities and also cannot be expected to answer the big questions, even though their personnel will include people from outside the institution. We are looking at a much broader thing now than that which was looked at in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Equally, a peak ethics body under the NHMRC umbrella will reflect certain assumptions of that body, praiseworthy as many of them will be. It simply makes sense for a greater distance to be set between the two. Whatever our own opinions, we must acknowledge that Australian society has come to grips with major ethical questions in the field of medical research. If one were to look back 10 or 15 years I believe that many people in the community today would never have envisaged what is going on in medical research. These include setting possible limits to reproductive technology and asking whether funding genetic engineering for the purposes of enhancement rather than the avoidance of major disabilities is ethical. Once again, I think there are many people in the community who have little problem with the question of the disability aspects of the research into biotechnology but they really do have serious and grave problems with just trying to get better and smarter people out of the process or whatever other type of formula or criteria they are trying to use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is well to remember that the science of eugenics, the breeding of superior human beings, was considered morally acceptable and desirable in the early part of our century, an opinion held by many leaders of quite intellectual opinion in Western society. But I believe that that has now changed. It took the experience of Hitler, strangely enough, to teach the civilised world what happens when eugenics are taken to their conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It therefore remains proper that strong independent ethical bodies should be in a position to sound the alarm should medical research, perhaps for the best of motives&mdash;I do not question that&mdash;take us down any such road. While it is true that modern society does not have the same corpus of shared values as occurred a couple of generations ago, there is still a consensus that Australia ought not disregard basic moral assumptions. There are tens of thousands of non-churchgoing Australians who have far from discarded the Judaeo-Christian ethic. Their beliefs should also be considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia needs a body to search for and state fearlessly ethical truth because that is particularly important in regard to medical and scientific research. They should be able to do that without fear. To do its job, it must be independent of other bodies, no matter how well-respected, and it must be directly answerable to the Parliament. I believe that those questions are the questions that we must be focusing on as we further consider this Bill. It is for those reasons that I believe it is essential that this Bill be examined thoroughly by the Senate Standing Committee with the assistance of informed witnesses and not proceed in its current form. I look forward to the contribution of those witnesses later this week. </PARA>

I ask Senator Knowles how she supposes it has been constructed since it got established. If it has been okay to have an in-house ethics committee up until now, what on earth will happen when it is turned into a statutory authority? It is a puerile argument and probably a tedious point that I score. But she cannot possibly say it has been doing all right until now and suddenly the world of ethics must be separated. </PARA>

The ethics committee of the NHMRC is not the only ethics committee addressing ethics in this community. It is also separately constructed and it is also properly able to address these issues. Senator Harradine mentioned reasonable thinking people. They are the people who will be on the ethics committee. He also said there is no way it is open to public scrutiny. He clearly has not read the legislation either. The committees and the council have to come to the public as a process; they have to indicate and outline what they are proposing to do. They have to publicly consult at the outline stage. Having heard those submissions, and even given advice and advertisements on how to actually make the submissions, there is no way they could overlook allowing the community an opportunity to speak. Having done all of that, they take account of what the public has said. For the first time the NHMRC is seriously going to the public, and Senator Harradine wants to say that the ethics committee cannot be in there doing the same thing.

The ethics committee of the NHMRC has been carrying the responsibility of trying to define what are the ethical considerations for concern for medical researchers or the NHMRC. It has also come up with guidelines over time and they have been modified as public view changes and as other information comes to bear. It is important to note that it is not the only ethics committee under which medical research is done. It is not the only ethics committee under which ethics in our community are talked about. For the record, I am pleased to say that I was on that aforementioned committee. I also note, Senator Harradine did not say it, that I was certainly one of the two dissenters.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Harradine would only be quiet, I will come to that in just one minute. Talking over him is like shouting over broken glass. He should give me a go. The ethics committee of the NHMRC has drawn up guidelines over time. It has taken references from itself, the community or the Minister to look at the need to modify those guidelines from time to time and indeed was tackling the very challenging issues of ethical guidelines for medical research before it became a matter of serious public debate. One of the reasons that I am very interested in looking at this matter is that when I chaired the Senate Select Committee on Health Legislation and Health Insurance, although we took our terms of reference very seriously, we realised that we could not properly examine them without putting the whole debate about the costs of health in the proper context. We realised that it was time for the community to address the ethical questions of how much health costs. We recommended that the NHMRC take responsibility for a public debate about the ethics of health costs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If everybody in the community knew that it cost $75,000 to maintain a baby in a humidicrib, would the community say we need more of them, fewer of them, or about the same number? If the community knew how much it cost for major surgical procedures and highly technological health care, would the community want to have a say about it? By and large I discovered that the community does want to have a say about it. There are different voices, and how one actually concludes what might be the reasonable outcomes of those deliberations, I think, is a matter of great sophistication. But I believe that the ethics committee of the NHMRC has done it in the past, and it has been challenged to do it. Indeed, if one reads the report of the 113th session of the NHMRC, which was tabled in this place last week&mdash;and I spoke to it then&mdash;one sees that it actually refers to the responsibilities given to it as a result of the recommendation from our Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to genetic registers and such things, Senator Harradine sort of stretches his eyes and sucks his breath in and that somehow seems to be a kind of argument. I do not find it persuasive at all. If we did not have genetic registers, Senator Harradine would be in here recommending them. If we had no ethics guidelines for the NHMRC, Senator Harradine would be in here recommending them, too. I do not know why Senator Harradine would possibly want to take issue with a structure that has dealt very honourably with the challenge of trying to define the parameters for medical research and suddenly say `This is an appalling process; we must get rid of it'. It has been behaving itself very well over time, it has been given a different set of definitions, it has a different responsibility to consult with the community and to take submissions, it has a different set of definitions to deliberate on all of those things before it actually proceeds to make its recommendations, and it is set up separately from the other committees. I do not quite know how much more difference Senator Harradine wants spelt out for him. This is a form, a design, that continues the importance of having ethical considerations as part of medical research, but it is strengthened in terms of this separation, its requirement to consult with the community, and the reports to this place that will be required either independently or under the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The register of genetic disorders may be one thing that people would want to discuss, but the question is: where will the registers be held? Senator Harradine is wonderful at leaping into the future with fear and loathing and absolutely no sense of what the facts or the conditions are. If Senator Harradine were to ask me what people in the community are concerned about, he would find that they are concerned about genetic disorders&mdash;massively so. What we are trying to do is set up genetic counselling. I would not have thought that it was unreasonable to suggest that there should be a proper list or understanding of where those genetic disorders exist in the community so that, with the proper respect and privacy that have always pertained to things in the medical arena, they will have that extra knowledge and the benefits of it.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to go into all of those things. We are addressing this legislation here. Senator Harradine is introducing very spurious points of fear and worry when they are of no real worry to the legislation or to the point that he has raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no reason why an ethics committee, as constituted under this legislation, could not properly deliberate on all of the issues and many more that we have not even thought of yet. But, if registers of genetic disorders are the only concern, I am quite sure that the medical ethics committee, the bioethics committee and the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in this place can look at that. Any number of bodies can look at those. Senator Harradine knows that full well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interesting question is: what constitutes ethics for Senator Harradine? Over the years I have been much more worried about the sexism of medical research. This is a matter of major ethics. In one of the health journals in this country&mdash;I note that Senator Harradine did not cite my article&mdash;there were some instructions as to what to do to help a spouse returning home after a heart attack. It was stated that this person returning home would be ably assisted by his spouse. She would see that he had the right amount of rest. She would see that he had the right amount of exercise. She would see that he was properly fed and that his food was adequately cooked and so on. The question is: what happens to her when she goes home after a heart attack?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think Senator Harradine could rely on the honourable gentlemen of the community up until that time to necessarily provide all the care that the journal judged as good health care.

I do not know what the correlation is, but it would have to be a very clever one! Senator Harradine has never raised the ethical considerations of sexism in the allocation of the medical research dollar. I would have thought that it is equally a matter of ethical consideration.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of issues of major concern. There is a proper need for an ethical deliberation about the allocation of research dollars to NHMRC, the sorts of inquires it makes and the research it does. Indeed, there has been a very big fight within the NHMRC over the years to get any allocations away from so-called hard, scientific medical research and into the arena of public health where the broad considerations of promotion of good health and prevention of disease were not getting the allocation that certainly the sponsors of that research felt were justified. I think the newly constructed membership of the NHMRC reflects an agreement that at last those are valid areas of inquiry too. Is that an ethical question? I think that the good health of the community certainly is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the question of the allocation of medical research dollars along sexist lines is an ethical consideration; certainly an equity one, which is another of Senator Harradine's points. I find that I cannot possibly be persuaded by his arguments because of his selected morality and because the principles of an ethics committee, separate from but charged with reviewing the questions of the allocation of research done by the NHMRC, seems to me entirely proper. As I say, I am quite sure that, if the committee was not there, Senator Harradine would be standing up to amend the legislation to set one up. I think the arguments are insufficient and very limited.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is considering the National Health and Medical Research Council Bill 1992, and the question is how it ought to be established and how it ought to function within Australian society. There is no doubt that in its continuing role as a peak advisory body to the Australian community in relation to matters of public health, health care, health and medical research, and ethical issues relating to health it is a body of great significance whose various decisions&mdash;whether it be as to funding a specific type of research or a particular project, or as to the ethical guidelines which it considers to be proper to require funded institutions to abide by&mdash;are of extreme importance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is because of the great importance of the National Health and Medical Research Council that the Government has considered it proper to give it a statutory base and therefore an independence from executive government, and to give its members from time to time, whoever they may be, an assurance that the Parliament considers that the task which is undertaken by the Council on behalf of the community is indeed very important and deserving of special recognition as to its status by its creation by parliamentary statute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the various functions of the National Health and Medical Research Council have been well canvassed during the debate and, indeed, are a matter of very common knowledge. The real issue is about the way in which ethical guidelines are to be promulgated for the conduct of research within various institutions&mdash;or not merely research, but also I suppose the practice of medicine within various institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been a mark of the work of the National Health and Medical Research Council that in so many of the institutions which provide health care and medical research throughout Australia there have been established institutional ethics committees which have a role in ensuring that within a particular institution consideration is given to the ethical parameters which should accompany the care or research being offered or undertaken. This has been a very significant move within the Australian community and, whatever its limits, I believe it is to be greatly welcomed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, the question of who or what body ought to issue the sorts of guidelines about which we are speaking will be of critical interest to those who engage in the debate in the committee stage of this Bill's passage through the Parliament&mdash;whether in the Friday sitting or the Committee of the Whole. I believe it is important to the Australian community that it be able to have great confidence in the body which issues the guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not persuaded at first blush&mdash;although I have not had the benefit of a consideration of any actual terms&mdash;by Senator Harradine's proposal that, in general and as a matter of course and as a matter of the common operation of the issuing of the guidelines, that be done by the Parliament by way of affirmative vote&mdash;that is, that both chambers of this Parliament should, in effect, become the issuers of the guidelines covering a vast range of matters. That is the way in which the guidelines are to be issued, as I understood Senator Harradine to be suggesting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would not&mdash;and would never&mdash;deny that there must be occasions where this Parliament or a State or Territory parliament, depending on the jurisdiction involved, ought to take responsibility in relation to a particular matter. I do not think that can ever be excluded from the proper deliberation and consideration of a body of elected representatives of the Australian people when it is asked to decide a question of the ethical parameters within which certain research or care ought to be undertaken or offered. I do not think there can be any permanent abdication of that role; that would be a grave dereliction of our duty. But I believe that would be an uncommon situation rather than the general way in which guidelines ought to be promulgated. I think the Australian community would lack confidence in that sort of process. It would think that it could become very highly politicised in relation to a whole range of issues and I think it would prefer to see the issuing of guidelines in the general way being the work of a committee of eminence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has structured this Bill so that the Australian Health Ethics Committee is such a body which, as a principal committee within the National Health and Medical Research Council structure, obviously has a very persuasive and critical role in the formulation of the sorts of ethical guidelines which should govern the matters with which we are concerned. I believe that in going in that direction the Government's Bill, as presented to the Senate, indicates the way in which this matter ought to be resolved&mdash;that is, by an eminent committee issuing the guidelines. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1992. The coalition is not opposing the passage of this Bill, which makes amendments to a total of eight different Acts. However, there are three of concern to the Opposition that I wish to refer to: firstly, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975; secondly, the Freedom of Information Act 1982; and, thirdly, the Judiciary Act 1903. Amendments relating to the other Bills in this omnibus package are, in our view, of a minor policy or technical nature.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dealing first with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975, the Bill inserts a new section 27A which provides that, subject to some specified exceptions, a person who makes a reviewable decision must take reasonable steps to give notice to all persons affected by the decision of the making of the decision and also of their right to have the decision reviewed. It is also provided that failure to take such steps to give notice will not affect the validity of the decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The exceptions where notice need not be given are set out in proposed subsection 27A(2). They include a decision not to impose a penalty, a decision to adjust the level of periodic payments to a class of persons, and a decision which determines a person to be in the most favourable of several categories of entitlement to a monetary benefit. Notice of the decision in these cases need not be given provided it does not adversely affect the interests of any other person. Nor need notice be given where another piece of legislation provides for notification of the right of review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`Reviewable decision' is defined in proposed new section 27A as a decision that is reviewable by the AAT or those decisions which are made in the first and second instances which would ultimately be reviewable by the AAT. Proposed new section 27B empowers the Attorney-General to write a code of practice to facilitate the giving of notice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the Government is to move an amendment to address concerns raised by the Australian Securities Commission, which apparently fears that proposed new section 27A would impose on it an unduly onerous obligation. The coalition intends to support that amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second Act is the Freedom of Information Act 1982. This Bill inserts new subsection 7(2)(2AA) into that Act to provide that corporate bodies established under legislation listed in part III of schedule 2 are exempt from the operation of the Act in relation to documents about their commercial activities. The legislation listed in new part III of schedule 2 is primary industry related and includes the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1980, the Australian Wool Corporation Act 1991 and the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989. Corporations so exempted are in fact already exempted in respect of their commercial activities in part II of schedule 2. The Bill deletes them from part II and inserts them in new part III.

I understand that there will be further Government amendments to its own Bill. The first amendment to the Judiciary Act 1903 is to include a reference to the Attorney-General of the ACT under subsection 40(1). This will mean that he or she will have the same power to seek the removal of a cause of action involving constitutional issues to the High Court as the other Attorneys-General.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate tonight is debating the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1992. The Bill is an omnibus Bill which proposes to amend a number of Acts falling within the Attorney-General's portfolio. The proposed amendments are of a minor policy nature. However, some of the amendments will have an important effect upon existing and future legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, there is an amendment to the Freedom of Information Act 1982 which has been initiated in order to obtain the agreement of the States and Territories to supply data from their land titles registers to the Commonwealth. This data will then be stored and accessed through the proposed Law Enforcement Access Network, commonly known as LEAN, which is to be operated by the Attorney-General's Department. There has been some concern over the establishment of such a network and I will return to this issue a little later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are four main pieces of legislation which this Bill seeks to amend. These are the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975, the Freedom of Information Act 1982, the Judiciary Act 1903 and the Sex Discrimination Act 1984. There are also some minor amendments to the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. I was pleased to see that today both parties rejected the statements by Mr Morgan who thought that this particular Act should be repealed, otherwise we might have had cause to debate that a little more tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main amendment to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act is to insert a new section 27A into the Act to provide, subject to certain exceptions, a requirement that persons affected by decisions which are reviewable by the AAT be notified of the decisions and their rights of review. This amendment substantially gives effect to the recommendations contained in the Administrative Review Council's Report No. 27 entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Access to Administrative Review Stage One: Notification of Decisions and Rights of Review</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats have always argued that individuals should be afforded adequate protection of their rights within the legal system. The introduction of this notification process ensures that persons affected by administrative decisions are notified of the decision and of any further review process which they are entitled to pursue. It reflects a recognition that a review is of no assistance to a person who does not know that such a right exists. The only disappointing aspect of this amendment is that it was not introduced way back in 1975. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also seek clarification from the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) on a matter related to this amendment. It concerns proposed subsection 27A(2)(c)(ii) which is one of the exemptions to the section 27A(1) notification requirements. Proposed subsection 27A(2)(c)(ii) exempts a person who makes a reviewable decision from complying with section 27A(1) notification requirements if it is a decision adjusting the level of periodic payments to be paid to a person as a member of a `class of persons'.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would appreciate clarification as to whether this exemption would have the effect of excluding, for instance, a group of AIDEX demonstrators. Would they be grouped as a class of persons or are they simply a group within that class, and will every member of that group receive notification?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the drafting of the Bill, the Chairman of the Australian Securities Commission, Mr Tony Hartnell, has publicly raised concern over proposed section 27A and its effects upon the ASC. This concern was reported in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> on 10 August this year. The article reports that Mr Hartnell wrote to the Attorney-General on 3 August complaining that the proposed section 27A would force the ASC to reveal confidential applications made during company takeovers.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Acting on this concern, I understand the Government will be moving an additional amendment to this Bill to overcome any possible adverse consequences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The thrust of this amendment will be to defer the application of section 27A to decisions under the corporations law for six months to enable an assessment of the extent to which permanent exemption from the notification of decision and review rights requirements may be justified. After that time, the ASC will be required to comply with those requirements unless the regulations provide that particular decisions should be exempt.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats will be supporting this amendment. I add that the Australian Democrats and, possibly, the Scrutiny of Bills Committee may not be totally happy with the regulatory framework which allows for exemptions to be created by regulation. However, as these are subsequently disallowable, we would agree that this is desirable at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next piece of legislation to be amended by this Bill is the Freedom of Information Act 1982. An important amendment to this Bill is a proposal to insert a new subsection 12(1)(ba) into the Act which extends the categories of documents which a person is not entitled to obtain access to under the Act by including documents forming part of land titles registers maintained by each State and Territory. The reason for this amendment was explained by the Minister, and obviously is designed to protect the revenue of the States and Territories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The establishment of LEAN arose as a direct consequence of the Government's acceptance of the 1987 recommendations made by the paper entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Review of Systems for Dealing with Fraud on the Commonwealth</EMPHASIS>. The Government argues in the LEAN briefing paper dated 12 June of this year that it has a responsibility to protect the community from those who break the law and attempt to rip off the taxpayers through welfare cheating, tax evasion and other fraudulent means. The briefing paper goes on to say that it is recognised that there are privacy implications of the program. However, all governments have to balance those interests with the very clear benefits to the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The LEAN briefing paper states quite clearly that LEAN will only contain data publicly available from company and land records. This is fair enough. However, the concern must be that in other situations the material that is available on record and can be accessed has been excluded. We only have to look at the extended use that is being made of the tax file number to realise that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties has questioned the value of creating this LEAN database on the ground that its cost to operate outweighs any benefit obtained from the consolidation of publicly available information onto a single database. Ministerial comment on this point may be appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I have very strong reservations about the adequacy of the Privacy Act 1988 and the Commonwealth Crimes Act 1914 to effectively deter any illicit trading of the confidential information contained in the LEAN database. My concern is highlighted by the recent findings of the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption which confirmed longstanding anecdotal evidence of the multi-million dollar trade in confidential government information. Again, the Minister may wish to address that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another amendment to the Freedom of Information Act 1982 is a proposal to exempt both the Attorney-General's Department and the Australian Government Solicitor from the operation of the Act in relation to documents in respect of commercial activities they undertake. I understand that the coalition is concerned about these proposed exemptions being used to restrict bona fide FOI applications and views the exemptions as too broad in their scope when considering the other exemptions already available under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 42 of the Act exempts documents which are subject to legal professional privilege. In addition, there is provision in section 40(1)(d) to exempt documents where their disclosure would have a substantial adverse effect on the proper and efficient conduct of the operations of an agency. The Australian Democrats have prepared an amendment which seeks to narrow the scope of these proposed exemptions to documents relating to the terms, conditions and charges applicable to the provision of legal services by the Department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, following further discussion with the Government, the Democrats have decided not to move that amendment. In particular, we acknowledge that there is a need to permit information relating to specific clients which does not attract legal professional privilege&mdash;client profiles, client needs analysis and other matters of this type&mdash;to be not disclosable. The same can be said about information on the expertise of particular staff, opinions, legal research that is prepared and similar information. On that basis, as I said, the Democrats will now not be moving that amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third piece of legislation to be amended by this Bill is the Judiciary Act 1903. The amendments to this Act will enable all lawyers who carry out work of a legal professional nature within the Attorney-General's Department to deliver legal services under a user-pays system. The amendments will also enable the Department to recover the costs for legal services which it has provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister has stated that the user-pays system will enable the Department to consolidate its existing in-house expertise by making it available to all clients so that the Commonwealth's expenditure on counsel's fees will be constrained. There might also be the hope&mdash;and it may be a forlorn hope&mdash;that it might work generally to contain the charges made by the legal profession. However, if we look at the two-airline policy we can see that that sort of constraint by a government corporation operating in the market certainly did not have that effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been some concern that the proposed changes to section 55E of the Judiciary Act 1903 do not ensure that all lawyers in the Attorney-General's Department who carry out work of a legal professional nature&mdash;and not just those lawyers performing work for the clients of the Australian Government Solicitor&mdash;have the rights and obligations of a legal practitioner and can charge for the provision of legal services. I understand that the Government will be moving additional amendments. The Democrats will not be opposing these amendments. However, we will oppose Government amendment No. 4 and we will move an amendment to remove a minor inconsistency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final piece of legislation to be amended by this Bill is the Sex Discrimination Act. The amendment proposes to substitute a new subsection 41(4) into the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 to require insurers, where requested by a client, to provide access to the actuarial or statistical data on which sex discrimination in an insurance policy is based. Obviously, this is a useful and necessary provision. The Australian Democrats will support the second reading amendment moved by the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA>These amendments, which I foreshadowed in my speech during the second reading debate, relate to the Freedom of Information Act and concern the exemption proposed for the Attorney-General's Department and the Australian Government Solicitor from the requirements of that Act in respect of their commercial activities. As I touched upon earlier, we are concerned that this exemption could be used to restrict the provision of information in response to bona fide applications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we appreciate that the exemption would apply only to documents with respect to the competitive commercial activities of the Department and the AGS, it seems to us that it is simply too broad to make the exemption available to the whole Department and the AGS. This view is reinforced by the availability, through section 42 of the Act, of an exemption for documents which attract legal professional privilege and also by the provision in section 40(1)(d) of an exemption for documents where their disclosure could reasonably be expected to have a substantial adverse effect on the proper and efficient conduct of the operations of an agency. There can remain few types of sensitive documents which could not be withheld under one of these existing provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the Government is concerned that a document such as a tender for the provision of legal services would not be covered and would therefore have to be released to a person who made an FOI request, even if that person were a competitor in the tender process. There is also a concern that the commercial operations of Auscript could be jeopardised by people trying to avoid paying Auscript's commercial rates for court transcripts by seeking to obtain transcripts through FOI applications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We accept that these examples would produce undesirable results if the Government's concern were valid, but we would prefer to see an amendment designed specifically to remedy such problems if the Government is seriously concerned by this possibility. However, it seems to us that in any case it would arguably be proper for such requests to be denied under the existing paragraph 40(1)(d) of the Act that I mentioned a moment ago, as the release of such information in both circumstances outlined would certainly have a substantial adverse effect on the proper and efficient conduct of the agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The broader provisions which make the exemption available to the whole Department and to the AGS seem to us unnecessary and to overlap with existing provisions of the Act.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I have chosen to make a contribution on the adjournment debate because a number of issues have been raised in the last 24 hours which need some clarification. The first relates to a speech that was given yesterday by Hugh Morgan at the Australian National University in which he slammed the Mabo decision of the High Court.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of us know Hugh Morgan's philosophy. He is entitled to his views in this society. However, there are a couple of points that require very definite clarification. First of all, he is talking about the law and about the High Court. It would be wise for him to get his facts right. Firstly, he makes the claim that the High Court decision somehow affects individual property rights in this country. I suggest he gets some legal advice about that matter and a formal description and analysis of the High Court decision. If he does he will find that in no way are individual property rights challenged by the recognition of native title within the common law of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, it might be wise if he had a look at the precedent of recognition of native title. The recognition of native title within Australia may be only a few months old, but native title has been part of the common law in North America since 1763. It has been part of the common law in New Zealand since 1840. I am sure that you would agree, Mr Deputy President, that we do not see a great wave of protest from North America about the fact that their property rights have been taken from them, nor indeed from New Zealand. That is the second point I wish to clarify. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next thing that really disturbs and disappoints me&mdash;whilst recognising that Hugh Morgan's philosophy and mine are somewhat different&mdash;is that his statements relating to Aboriginal culture were very insulting. I would not even repeat them in this place. Hugh Morgan should remember that he is insulting perhaps the oldest and most sophisticated culture yet studied by anthropologists. He should think twice about making sweeping statements about that culture. It is one thing to ignore the High Court; it is another to dismiss Aboriginal culture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, he fails to know anything about international law and international precedent. Perhaps the best thing Hugh Morgan could do&mdash;if he wants to continue to represent elements of the mining industry in Australia&mdash;would be to go to Canada quick smart. He will discover that in Canada the mining industry has readily accepted native title, because it is not something new in Canada. It has accepted a whole range of decisions relating to the rights of ownership of the land by Canada's indigenous people and it works closely with indigenous people and takes it as a fact of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Eventually we will have a similar position in this country. Indeed, I have great faith that various sections of the mining industry are already perfectly prepared to work with Australia's indigenous people and negotiate what is appropriate within that industry. I do not believe that Hugh Morgan's statements of yesterday are at all typical of the mining industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This brings me to a question asked by Senator Tambling today of Minister Collins in my absence. I left the chamber a little earlier than I perhaps should have. I wanted to clarify what my position is in relation to self-government for Australia's indigenous people. Forms of self-government already exist in regard to community councils in Queensland and the Northern Territory. Forms of self-government are already accepted by governments&mdash;this Government, governments in other States and governments on both sides of the political spectrum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not quite sure why certain people get so nervous when one talks about self-government in relation to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. We already have a form of self-government at the local level. It was certainly recognised in the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody that if we are to seriously address many of the social issues which were focused upon in that report, then we have to take seriously the rhetoric that we have used for a long time, but have been less vigilant in actually implementing, in regard to this question of self-determination or self-government&mdash;call it what you will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not talking about sovereignty or secession from Australia; we are talking about people in this country having the right to self-determination and appropriate forms of self-government, yet to be determined in terms of debate and consultation over the coming years. There are particular parts of Australia&mdash;the Torres Strait is a classic example, but also perhaps the Kimberleys and Arnhem Land&mdash;which do appear to lend themselves to a greater degree of control by the indigenous people, in negotiation, consultation and all those words of consensus with other Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this sounds a little different or even a little radical to some people, I suggest that precedents exist overseas and they exist in Australia. In Canada the House of Commons Special Committee on Indian Self Government of 1983 recommended that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government establish a new relationship with Indian first nations and that an essential element of this relationship be recognition of Indian self-government. The Committee recommends that the right of Indian peoples to self-government be explicitly stated and entrenched in the Constitution of Canada. The surest way to achieve permanent and fundamental change in the relationship between Indian peoples and the Federal Government is by means of a constitutional amendment. Indian first nation Governments would form a distinct order of government in Canada, with their jurisdiction defined.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the Committee has concluded that the surest way to lasting change is through constitutional amendments, it encourages both the Federal Government and Indian first nations to pursue all processes leading to the implementation of self-government. . . </PARA>
<PARA>In recent years Canadian debate has focused more directly on constitutional reform. At the present time a Canadian Royal Commission is examining, firstly, the history of relations between Aborigines, the Canadian Government and society as a whole and, secondly, the recognition and affirmation of Aboriginal self-government, its origin, content and strategy for progressive implementation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had the good fortune to visit Canada and talking about self-government for Canada's first nation peoples is as normal as asking, `Would you please pass the salt?'. People do not get upset and start screaming about black rule or takeovers or say, `What is this going to mean for us, the majority?'. Australians will have to face these issues with a greater degree of maturity&mdash;dare I say&mdash;than that exhibited in Hugh Morgan's speech yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Noting that that kind of debate has been going on in Canada for some time now and that that policy direction seems well ahead of Australian thinking, perhaps we should have a look at a Queensland Government discussion paper. It is only a discussion paper but, nevertheless, it raises a number of these issues in an informed way for debate and consideration. It was released in August 1991 and advocated self-government legislation consistent with the following four principles:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There be a recognition of the pre-existing rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to self-government in the preamble, and the body of the proposed legislation;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minimum powers should be provided to Aboriginal and Islander communities to control their local and internal affairs, their physical and cultural survival and development, and their economy and resources;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These powers and their exercise should not be subject to government, ministerial, or departmental veto except according to clear and precise criteria stated in the legislation, and any such veto should be subject to review; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unless a community indicates otherwise, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community should have the jurisdiction to resolve disputes between themselves.</PARA>
<PARA>This was a discussion paper not to implement legislation tomorrow, next week or next year, but to highlight the fact that these issues are on the agenda. The momentum for change is there and I believe we have to address these issues with a degree of intellectual sophistication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people would dismiss both these examples and say, `Canada can do what it likes; we have to concentrate on what we want', and that is fair enough. I would never suggest that Australia has to slavishly follow a Canadian model, a United States model or a model from anywhere else. But I think we can learn from them, adapt and adjust according to what overseas experience presents us with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, of the Queensland discussion paper people will say, `It is only a discussion paper and there is certainly no sign of it going into legislation in that State at the moment'. But let us look at something that happened back in 1979&mdash;the Norfolk Island Act of that year. I am sure Senator Bjelke-Petersen will remember that Malcolm Fraser was Prime Minister at that time. This Act was the initiative of a Liberal-National coalition. The Norfolk Island Act gave a mere 1,500 residents the right to elect their own Government with many of the powers of State and Federal governments including education, health, taxation, immigration, law and order and social welfare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Norfolk Island Act noted that there was a good reason for this legislation. It was not establishing a precedent; there was just a very special reason. The reason was `the special relationship of the Pitcairn descendants with Norfolk Island and their desire to preserve their traditions and culture'. Speakers on both sides of the chamber advocated that there be a special status for recognition of self-government because of that distinctive feeling that the people of Norfolk Island have&mdash;that uniqueness and that sense of belonging to Norfolk Island. That was recognised in 1979. Another speaker said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We cannot avoid the question of Norfolk Island being part of Australia, yet at the same time we cannot be seen to be preventing the people who have lived there for so long from continuing to live in the way they have for so long.</PARA>
<PARA>If we are not very careful we will be guilty of an enormous double standard. If we can so readily accept self-government for 1,500 residents of Norfolk Island&mdash;I do not begrudge them their self-government; I would vote in favour of it if the proposal were to come before this chamber in 1992&mdash;why is it different for the indigenous people of Australia in certain parts of Australia? I am not proposing it for the heart of Sydney or in the country towns of Queensland, but in quite distinct, specific areas of Australia where it may be very appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are no signs to date from either of the major political parties that these sentiments and action of more than a decade ago are about to be redirected to the Torres Strait, the Tiwi Islands&mdash;Elcho, Bathurst and Melville Islands&mdash;the Kimberleys or Arnhem Land. However, the momentum for reform is gaining strength. For the time being we are focusing&mdash;by `we' I do not just mean government, but all parliamentarians&mdash;our attention on a 10-year reconciliation process leading up to the centenary of Federation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation has already acknowledged that the High Court decision has brought forward that particular debate. Constitutional reform is already being discussed with suggestions that the rights of indigenous people could perhaps be enshrined in an amendment which recognises the historical and cultural rights of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders in determining their futures. Power and decision making will need to be shared if reconciliation is to take place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a recent conference on the impact of the Mabo decision&mdash;it was a conference held by the Cape York Land Council at Yarrabah&mdash;one of the speakers said that it was time for Australians to put their brains into reverse if they were really going to come to terms with the implications of the High Court decision. I very sincerely hope that we can put our brains in reverse, that we can think afresh on a number of these issues related to the rights of indigenous people, that we can think creatively and keep an open mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need not feel that just because there might be some new ways of addressing these issues we have to have screaming, threatening headlines such as those Hugh Morgan has unfortunately introduced into this debate. That kind of polarised debate will get us nowhere. I believe it is unfortunate that someone like Hugh Morgan has bought into the debate in such a way, not because he does not have the right to buy into the debate, but because he has done it without his facts and without a real knowledge of the very significant issues involved. I believe it does not assist the reconciliation process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that next time the issue of land rights or self-government for indigenous people in this country is debated in this place we can debate it calmly, coolly and without feeling threatened. Why should we, representing as we do indigenous people and a population that of course is primarily non-indigenous, feel so threatened by Aborigines reclaiming their history and culture? We do not have anything to feel threatened about. We should be able to go into the debate in a mood of tolerance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I very rarely speak in adjournment debates in this place, but this evening I want to raise what is considered a matter of urgency by a number of parents in the Toowoomba region. They are concerned about the increasing use of pornography in our electronic media.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been approached, as have my colleagues Senator Ron Boswell and Senator Bill O'Chee, by St Theresa's Parish Council in Toowoomba. The Council writes that it has had complaints from people of all ages who feel that, primarily, the Australian electronic media is acting to destroy all forms of decency and morality. I will quote from their letter, which is a direct plea to politicians to act now to stop what they see as the decay of moral standards in our society. The letter reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are writing to express our disgust, horror and sadness at the endorsement of promiscuity that continues to decay our society.</PARA>
<PARA>The letter goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The electronic media has an enormous power over the public, especially the young and impressionable. The escalating problem of unemployment of our young people leaves them very little self respect and decency;</PARA>
<PARA>In these days when there is a lot of unemployment perhaps young people might have too much time to sit at home and watch a lot of television. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When they see that the Australian media paint a picture of an immoral society it is seen by our young to be the accepted standard. Recently, television was advertising a newly released cassette/compact disc&mdash;all the tunes on the disc were very suggestive and each one supplied accompanying vulgar visual clips. This was advertised on prime time which we find is unacceptable. The moral standards of our young are being undermined in an effort to sell the particular product.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Nine Network screens the weekly series "Sex with Sophie Lee" at 8.30 pm. Firstly, we feel that the time slot should be 9.30 pm. The visual displays are disgusting and the fact that most people interviewed appear to be teenagers, promotes out of control promiscuity amongst our young adults.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When our society has been crippled with the AIDS epidemic which is spread by promiscuous irresponsible lifestyles, television stations, advertising censors will then realise that events have escalated out of control.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>say the writers from Toowoomba&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">our sexuality is a gift from God and the sex act expresses commitment and love which is essential for a happy family life. However, television shows such as "Chances" depict sex as temporary and lustful. The pornography market flourishes in Canberra, condoned by the irresponsible attitude of our current Government to such material.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The permission granted by the Minister for Communications to telecast X rated pornographic and R rated violent material on the proposed "Pay T.V." in Australia further adds to our anxiety for the declining moral standards within Society.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Surely&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>they add&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">there must be a number of politicians, T.V. producers, programme co-ordinators with young families who share the same concern for our families and young people. We want you&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>they say&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to . . . Respond to our concerns, change the worrying focus of pornography and reduced family emphasis in television and this will provide moral leadership for families into the 21st century.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a mother and a grandmother, any issues which affect women and families rate the highest priority with me. This issue should be of the highest concern to all women and, indeed, families throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government has made a sham of looking after families. It has given in to yet another minority, the peddlers of pornography, in an industry which makes money out of exploiting women and which caters to the more perverse elements in society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators opposite talk about civil liberties&mdash;the rights of people to do what they wish and to pursue a normal successful life to the best of their ability. I ask honourable senators&mdash;not that there are too many here at present, but what could be a greater infringement on the rights of the majority of average Australians than the sort of dangerous material that we are talking about this evening? What could be more harmful to the pursuit of those aims?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Decent families, church groups, women's groups and many other organisations have been crying out for firm action to be taken to stamp out this smut. All these organisations feel very concerned that action has not been taken to stop the proliferation of pornographic and sexually explicit material. I am sad to say that Canberra is the porn capital of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is evidence readily available to show that this type of material has a detrimental effect on our society. I dispute the spurious arguments put by supporters of pornography that a ban on such material would drive it underground. That is a hoary argument put up by people who deliberately do not want the best for the community. We should remember that murder is done in private. Does that mean that we should legalise murder so that it can be brought out into the open?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of us here this evening are parents. We realise that, as parents, it is difficult to control what our children watch and see during their daily activities. I am very concerned that many young people watching explicit sexual material as well as violent material may come to believe that such behaviour is acceptable. They might think that, because they have seen it on a television show or on a video, it cannot be all that bad. I sometimes wonder whether so much violence in our society today is due in no small measure to the R-rated videos and even the violent films shown on television. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sometimes when we watch the news at night time, we find that the first three or four items on television contain violence. This is also a real problem. More recently, we have been seeing the abduction at gunpoint of people sitting in their motor cars. One just begins to wonder where the young people who do these things get their ideas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While one can have some form of control in cinemas, control of access to television and video viewing is impossible. Governments have a responsibility to protect minors and others in the community from seeing material of a violent or sexual nature that would disturb them. I accept that parents have a responsibility as well, but parents, regrettably, are not always there to exercise control over television or video viewing. We cannot be too sure that those people over 18 years of age who see these videos are not adversely affected by them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude my contribution by saying that I am concerned at the proliferation of what can only be described as anti-family behaviour and material in today's society. I have stood up for the family many times in this chamber, but I do not think that I have ever been more worried about the future of families in Australia than I am today. Families are the cornerstone of society. They form the basic structure on which we build our lives. In order to maintain our way of life, health, safety and order, we must protect the interests of the family. That is why I have brought the concerns of the council members of St Theresa's parish in Toowoomba before the Senate in this adjournment debate tonight. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In June this year I drew the attention of the Senate to what I termed a longstanding and outrageous abuse of human rights that was perpetrated by Australia Post on one of its employees. In that speech, I detailed a catalogue of actions that are a public disgrace. Shortly after I left on a parliamentary delegation to Brazil, Senator Knowles found it necessary, in my absence, to comment rather forcefully on some aspects of what I had said, to condemn me for abusing parliamentary privilege, as she saw it, and exaggerating a case against somebody she held was merely doing his job.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It gave me no personal pleasure to say what I did at that time, but I believe it had to be done. Subsequently, proof of both the justice and the content of my remarks and of the necessity of making them was contained in a letter I recently received from the Commonwealth Ombudsman. I have obtained the permission of the Ombudsman's office to quote the letter in full tonight. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Bell,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You will recall your speech to the Parliament on 3 June 1992 in which you referred to the case of Mr "Y" and his difficulties with Australia Post in relation to his employees' compensation entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We recognise the case, of course. We had been investigating Mr Yeatman's complaints about a specialist's video-taping an interview with him, and Australia's Post's refusal to provide certain documents to him on the grounds of legal professional privilege. However, when I read your account of Australia's Post's dealings with Mr Yeatman I placed the investigation on a formal basis, widened it to include the full scope of Australia Post's actions in the matter, and required it to provide all the relevant files to me.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The files bore out your criticism. On 3 September 1992 I wrote to the Managing Director to voice my grave concerns about Australia Post's treatment of its former employee, and I asked for urgent action. I am pleased to report that the Managing Director responded very promptly; Australia Post has apologised to Mr Yeatman and has paid him a substantial solatium; and Mr Yeatman has been assured that there will be no further reviews of his entitlement to compensation.</PARA>

<PARA>My office is still in regular contact with the aforementioned Mr Yeatman. Although the events following my speech in this place have gone part way to vindicating his longstanding complaint, Mr Yeatman nevertheless remains deeply scarred emotionally, as well as being financially disadvantaged by this experience. Having followed this case myself, I can understand his distrust, suspicion and continuing distress. As I quoted, the Ombudsman has reported that a substantial solatium was paid to Mr Yeatman as a gesture of apology. Nothing could begin to recompense him for the emotional pain and the financial hardship he has suffered over a considerable period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I trust that Australia Post will review its actions and properly compensate Mr Yeatman for the damage that has resulted from its callous and wilful wrongdoing. I wish to draw to the attention of the Senate the assurance contained in the letter that there will be no further reviews of Mr Yeatman's entitlement to compensation. Copies of correspondence that I have received make it easy to be less than convinced of such assurances from Australia Post. I can well understand why Mr Yeatman remains fearful that in a year or so somebody in Australia Post will find an excuse to revisit that assurance. There has been at least one previous occasion when a similar assurance to another employee was overturned a few years later, despite stating in previous correspondence that it had not proposed to take any further action then or in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The General Manager of Australia Post in Western Australia appears to have given a firm undertaking that no further reviews of Mr Yeatman's entitlement will take place. That manager's letter quite clearly gives this undertaking. I wish to note this assurance on the public record so that Mr Yeatman may also be able to accept it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, I would also like to acknowledge and pay tribute on the public record to the actions of the Commonwealth Ombudsman. This is one occasion when his role and function have been spectacularly demonstrated to be essential for achieving justice and fair play. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, this is an all too rare instance of a very unpleasant and distressing story having at least the possibility of a happy ending. This possibility comes about in great part as a result of the care and persistence of my staff and of the Democrats in general. In bringing this matter to the attention of the Senate, I point out that the role of the Senate as a forum for the airing of these kinds of issues has been vindicated and, I hope, strengthened. We can only hope that the injustices perpetrated against this man that I have raised in this place are speedily addressed and, further, with the watchful eyes of other honourable senators, Australia Post will never again behave in this way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes, The Department of Primary Industries does conduct a national survey for pesticides and other residues. The survey is known as the National Residue Survey (NRS), a broad based monitoring program for chemical contaminants in agricultural food commodities. A pilot survey for fisheries products, prior to their inclusion in the NRS, is also currently underway. The NRS is administered by the Bureau of Rural Resources within the Department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to part (a) of the question during the period 1988 to 1992 the NRS included export produce from within the following commodities; meat and offal, grains, fruit, vegetables, dairy products, eggs and honey. The meat program included samples from cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, deer, buffalo, horses, kangaroos and rabbits. The grains program included wheat, barley, oats and sorghum with some testing of miscellaneous grains and grain products. A diverse range of fruit and vegetables were also included.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The frequency of testing, in response to part (b) of the question, is outlined in the following table:</PARA>
<PARA>[TABLE OMITTED FROM DATABASE - SEE HARD COPY PAGE 1744]</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The results of the NRS are published in reports available to the public. In response to part (c) of the question the results for 1987 and 1988 were included in a report published in January 1990. The report for the results for 1989 and 1990 are now being printed and should be available on 12 October 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report for 1991 results is currently being prepared and the report for the 1992 results will be prepared in 1993. It is also important to note that in the context of export products, the results of the NRS meat program and the proposed program for the forthcoming year are made available to importing countries such as the EC and the USA for their approval. This is considered to be the most important part of the NRS reporting process as our continued access for Australian meat to these markets is dependent on the relevant authorities approving Australia's NRS forward program and acceptance of the NRS results for the previous year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such reporting arrangements do not exist for non-meat commodities at this time but may become essential for some markets should international concerns about the residues in food increase.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The value of imports of crude oil and other refinery feedstocks for the last five fiscal years is shown below.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as producing petrol and diesel, these feedstocks are used to manufacture a range of other products such as aviation gasoline, aviation turbine fuel, fuel oil and, in particular, lubricants and bitumen.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although part of our domestic petrol and diesel is manufactured from imported feedstocks, a principal technical reason for their use in Australian refineries is to meet domestic demand for bitumen and lubricants which are not available from Australian crudes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In presenting the information above, it should be noted that the Australian refinery system is technically about 100 per cent self-sufficient in our petrol and diesel requirements. That is, current levels of indigenous production of oil and condensate in Australia, and the refinery capacity needed to process these, are sufficient to meet domestic demand for petrol and diesel without the need to import either the finished products or the basic feedstocks for their manufacture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the commercial and technical environment in which the Australian oil market operates takes account particularly of the de-regulated crude oil market that now exists, as well as principles of economic efficiency and practical considerations, and these are reflected in an overseas trade pattern in which both the export and import of crude oil and refined products occurs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The value of exports of crude oil and other refinery feedstocks, as well as the value of exports and imports of petrol and diesel, are shown below for the same five fiscal years.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Currently, less than 13 megalitres per annum of ethanol is used as a substitute for petrol and diesel in alcohol/petrol and alcohol/diesel blends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The effect on the balance of payments of the substitution of various proportions of ethanol for petrol and diesel would be to release crude oil for export. The current value of such exports is estimated in the table below:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">[TABLE OMITTED FROM DATABASE - SEE HARD COPY PAGE 1745]</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Note: Assumes value of Australian crude oil exported is $A30 per barrel, fob, and that the crude oil would have been refined into petrol and diesel with 5 per cent losses in the refinery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The net effect on the economy would, however, be negative, since the cost of producing ethanol in these quantities (estimated to be between $A0.55 and $A1.20 per litre) is considerably higher than the cost of production of petrol. The cost of producing ethanol at an average, say, of 85 cents per litre, at the 10 per cent substitution level would be around $A2,300 million per annum compared to the export value of $A508 million for the crude oil saved (with no 5 per cent loss).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The uneconomic production of ethanol would have diverted investment from areas where it has better potential to earn additional income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Significant levels of ethanol production could also raise land use issues. A 1979 CSIRO study indicated that if land not then in use was used to grow crops for ethanol production it could supply up to perhaps 20% of petrol and diesel requirements. Use of a similar area of land today would</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">raise a number of land use issues including conservation and biodiversity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Diversion of existing farming lands for ethanol production would mean the loss of production in other areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If waste materials, eg starch effluent or forest residue, could be used economically, there would be essentially no impact on existing land use. However, the quantity of ethanol available from these sources is limited, perhaps less than 5% of petrol and diesel requirements. Furthermore, the technology for producing ethanol from forest by-products is not well established and raises other questions about increasing use of forest resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) No funds have been allocated for research into ethanol substitution in the past five years. Between 1978 and 1985 $A7 million was allocated by the Governments of the day to ethanol research and development. A 1985 review found that further research was unlikely to reduce costs and that the barriers to ethanol use as a transport fuel were economic rather than technical. Little has changed to alter that view.</PARA>
