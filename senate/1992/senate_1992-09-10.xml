<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. I refer him to the ANZ Bank report yesterday, reported in today's press, that the rundown in national savings, both private and public, for the last five quarters has been the most severe for almost 20 years and that national consumption is exceeding national disposable income by no less than 2.2 per cent of GDP. Does he agree that the increase in our national savings is essential for investment, job creation and stronger economic growth? If so, why does the Government persist with policies which deliberately accelerate the fall in public savings? I also ask whether it is correct that the Government brought on the recession which commenced in 1989-90 because consumption was far outstripping production. If so, why does the Government continue to pursue policies which lead to increased consumption without doing anything to provide the necessary climate for increased production?</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It will turn around, Senator. I know he is dismayed about that prospect, but it will turn around. The fact is that private savings fall because of falling incomes. So far as public savings are concerned, we had a bit of a debate about this following the Budget, but we believe the Government's budgetary position is sound because the structural Budget position is correct. The Budget deficit for 1992-93 is estimated to be 3.3 per cent of GDP&mdash;less, of course, than the 4.1 per cent we inherited in 1983-84.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, that is true. I understand the Opposition's reluctance, bent on narrow ideological commitment, to acknowledge facts. The fact is that in 1983-84 the Budget deficit as a percentage of GDP was 4.1 per cent. It is now 3.3 per cent. The Australian Government's Budget deficit as a share of GDP is lower in 1992-93, at 3.3 per cent, than that of the United States, which is 4.4 per cent, the United Kingdom, which is 4.2 per cent and Canada, which is 3.6 per cent, to take three relevant examples.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the years of Liberal-National Party Government Budgets, deficits averaged 2.4 per cent of GDP. Between 1984-85 and 1992-93, the estimated outcome is one per cent of GDP&mdash;around three-quarters of one per cent&mdash;and that includes the current year's estimate of 3.3 per cent, averaging it out over the period of this Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By international standards, as I pointed out, that is a very modest deficit outcome. That is because this Government is the only one in the last 30 years of the history of this country to run four Budget surpluses successively. In that circumstance, we can afford increased expenditure to help boost the economy and the productive sector of the economy, to which Senator Short referred in his question. In the context of a recession, that is an appropriate policy to adopt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's proven fiscal record has resulted in Australia having the lowest general government gross debt. In terms of the private sector, we hope for a recovery in that situation as we come out of the recession.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Senator Button in his answer said that the drain on national savings the Government has produced will be cyclical and will turn around. If so, why has the Keating Government drawn on public savings by almost $30 billion in the last two years and, on its own forecasts, will draw down national savings by a further $30 billion to $50 billion by the middle of this decade?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One can use those figures in a variety of ways. The Government has run deficits in the last two Budgets simply because of the recession. I would shudder to think that we were getting back to the situation of regular deficits which the Liberal Government used to run. We are not getting back to that at all. In terms of Budget outcomes, we have a commitment to get the Budget back into balance by the middle of the decade, and that is what we have said in the Budget Papers, as Senator Short knows.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First of all, I consult the industry all the time and have for a long time. I rather resent the fact that Dr Hewson and former National Party Senator Stone have described this as some form of collusion with the car companies. The decisions by the Government in relation to the automotive industry were based on a report from the Industry Commission. It recommended a 15 per cent tariff at the end of the century. It recommended the continuation of export facilitation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>that is Nissan&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">as an integral source of supply of aluminium castings and we are an extension of the . . . Nissan Motor Co globally.</PARA>
<PARA>I commend the reading of this article from a company which was once a manufacturer here, and will be until October, but which will become an importer of cars into this country. It highlights the importance of stability in tariff policy for this industry and the importance of linking this Australian industry with the global automotive economy. If we do not do that it will not survive. If honourable senators note that the automotive industry exported $1.2 billion last year, and that figure is growing, then they will understand the importance of those connections with the global automotive industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decisions by the Government were based on an Industry Commission report. Some of the Opposition's principally zealous spokesmen go around the country saying, `We are going to save industry $20 billion. Look at the Industry Commission report which identifies all these savings. We are going to screw our courage to the sticking place and save industry all these costs economy wide&mdash;all costs based on the Industry Commission report.' When it comes to the automotive industry, because of mindless zealotry, the Opposition says, `The Industry Commission report is not good enough for us. We are tougher than the Industry Commission on this issue. We are pursuing a National Farmers Federation 1970 agenda and we are going to have zero tariff for everybody'. That is what the Opposition is saying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to the Industry Commission report, it is not only that fact but also the fact that the Leader of the Opposition misreads the report and goes to Adelaide and says, `We will create 5,000 more jobs in the automotive industry in Australia.' That is the most loopy statement I have ever heard about industry policy by any leader in this country. How does he do that? He reads selectively an Industry Commission report which says that if all the changes are made to industry generally across Australia then more jobs would be created in an industry like this. But he ignores the Commission's estimates of the many more thousands of jobs that would be lost as a result of a zero tariff option.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services. I refer to the study that the Department had conducted by Harding and Landt which showed that most Australians have suffered a decline in living standards since Labor came into power in 1983. In particular, it showed that a two-income family with average weekly earnings and two children suffered a real decline of $1,000 per year, which was 3 per cent. Why has the Government allowed this disastrous situation to continue?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find it incredible that this question is directed to me in my capacity as representing the Minister for Health when it is about the purported decline in income available to two-income households in Australia. It seems to me to have nothing to do with any particular portfolio responsibility that I represent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is quite clear that the effect of the Federal Opposition's policy in the area for which I do have representation in this chamber would be to create a situation where those who are involved in providing for their households the medical and health services that are essential in the case of a particular illness or disease or traumatic automobile or industrial accident would be in a far worse position than they will be under the newly announced Medicare revamping that has been undertaken by this Government. I am quite sure that the Australian people and the householders to whom Senator Reid refers will want to have the assurance they can have from this Government that, in particular, the public hospital system will receive a huge injection of funds to ensure that all Australians can receive the medical and hospital attention they need to deal particularly with chronic illnesses and traumatic accidents, which otherwise can lead to tremendous expenditures falling on the household.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's answer to that is to require householders to pay increased private health insurance premiums. In order to shield some of the low income earners from the increased private health insurance premiums, they will transfer money that would otherwise go to the public hospitals in this country&mdash;they are cutting funds to the States by 5 per cent and that must impact on the public hospital system&mdash;to subsidies for private health insurance premiums. Under the Opposition, private health insurance premiums will increase because those opposite will leave an unregulated market where the private hospital system, and particularly the AMA and the doctors who belong to that union, will be able, according to Dr Hewson when he visited the AMA, to charge whatever the market will bear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian households of the sort Senator Reid purports to be concerned about will be faced with increasing costs to visit their general practitioner in order to get that vital primary health care, the primary way in which they receive medical attention. I believe that Senator Reid has misdirected her question. However, in so far as households will be affected by our various policies on the provision of health care, it is quite clear that Australian households will be far better off and less financially penalised under the Federal Government's proposals than they would be under the Opposition's.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right, Mr President. These figures are about absenteeism. Dr Hewson's comment attacking Australian workers for being lazy is relevant to the findings of the survey. The survey was reported by the National Institute of Labour Studies in Adelaide. It was reported most recently in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> under the headline `A nation of sickie takers? It's just an Aussie myth'. I will just summarise the report, which stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australians invented the term `sickie' but new research shows our reputation for taking them, which is said to have endangered our productivity and international competitiveness, is undeserved. We are not a nation of malingerers after all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The research found that most Australians use only half their entitlement.</PARA>
<PARA>The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Mark Wooden, an associate professor at the National Institute of Labour Studies in Adelaide, who has recently completed one of the biggest studies undertaken of absenteeism, found that despite a runny nose, a sore throat or a stiff back, most people drag themselves out of bed and into the workplace.</PARA>
<PARA>Those are the findings of the research. The findings show that absenteeism in Australia is less than in most OECD countries, that most Australians take, at most, only half of their entitlements, and that we are ranked in the middle order in the OECD.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That has to be contrasted with the allegations that Dr Hewson makes about lazy Australian workers. There is another report, referred to in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> in Queensland, by an Australian consulting group, Towers Perin, which compiled a national study entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Day in the Life</EMPHASIS>, to find out attitudes and views in the Australian workplace. The article quotes the report as stating:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`Australian workers are a cheery, hard-working lot&mdash;but they want a pat on the back for it.' That's the finding of a report released today, the most extensive ever compiled in Australia on the attitudes and opinions of the workforce.</PARA>
<PARA>The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The findings contrasted markedly with Australia's image as a nation of lazy and indifferent workers.</PARA>
<PARA>I conclude this quote with the statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Employers' groups, surprisingly, endorsed these survey's findings yesterday, admitting that managers could do better to foster closer relationships between themselves and their staff.</PARA>
<PARA>I think it is true that Australian farmers are hard working; certainly Australian miners are amongst the most productive in the world. In my recent tour of Australian manufacturing industry, employers said that their most important asset is their workers and they wished that they could pay them more. There is a general recognition, at real industry level, that the Australian worker is productive and hard working. But this continual knocking by Dr Hewson&mdash;knocking of the economy, knocking of the dollar and, now, knocking of Australian workers&mdash;is shameful and is an indication of his erratic behaviour and his immaturity.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce. I refer him to today's media reports that the Bush Administration intends to grant Mexican sugar producers preferential access to the US market under NAFTA, which, after six years, could totally replace  Australian sugar exports to the US. Does the Minister agree that this development will adversely affect the Australian sugar industry, which has already been hit by successive tariff reductions and which last year exported 120,000 tonnes of sugar to the US for an estimated return of $60m? Is this not a further sign of a world trend towards greater protectionism, at a time when both the Government and the Opposition are hell-bent on further reductions in protection? Finally, will the Government consider emergency measures to protect the Australian sugar industry from further damage arising from this US decision?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will answer the last part of the question first. The Government announced a policy of an effective tariff level in respect of the sugar industry in June of this year. It has an Industry Commission report before it for consideration, which the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Crean, has already indicated the Government does not intend to adopt in the totality of its recommendations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the second last part of the question, there are all sorts of fears, probably legitimate, in respect of both North America and a move towards higher protectionism for the NAFTA group of countries. There are fears about that, but those fears have to be considered in the hothouse environment of a United States presidential election in November in which it would seem, from reading the pronouncements by various political figures there, that almost anything goes. We have to take that into account in assessing the course of the American election and what might follow after it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fears are sometimes expressed about increased protectionism in Europe. It is very difficult to draw conclusions about that at present, but it may be so. If one looks at the European Community's agreement with Japan about the automotive industry, one can see that there is a highly protective regime in place until the year 2000, which effectively limits Japanese car imports into the European Community to 16 per cent of the market. The Europeans say that after the year 2000 it will be a free market, but we have heard all those things before. So there are concerns about those sorts of issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the point that 60 per cent of this country's trade is now conducted with the countries of the Asia-Pacific region. For example, the ASEAN countries are committed to lowering protection. In some countries within ASEAN, such as Singapore, there is pretty well a free market, as there is in Hong Kong. In various parts of the region there are different regimes in place. The things Senator Coulter talked about in North America as growing trends towards protectionism are not so apparent in the area in which we conduct something like 60 per cent of our trade and where our largest trading partners are Japan, Taiwan, China, Korea and so on. A very small percentage of our trade is conducted, for example, with the United Kingdom or Europe, relative to what it was 30 years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the sugar industry is concerned, the trap in NAFTA and the illusions that have been floated around about NAFTA and Australia becoming a member of NAFTA are simply these: it is quite apparent that in terms of imports, of free trade with Australia, as a member of the NAFTA group we would be beneficiaries&mdash;I hope the way I am using that word is understood&mdash;of computers, motor cars and things of that kind from the United States. Our industries such as sugar, wheat, steel and dairy products would not be beneficiaries of any such arrangement. It is quite clear that our exports to the United States would not be allowed in on a free and fair basis in the context of the NAFTA agreement. That is why they do not want us. That is why they have never asked us to join NAFTA, and it is most unlikely that they ever would. Our more competitive industries would do a lot of damage in their marketplace, and that is something the United States clearly will not tolerate, whether it be from Japan or anywhere else.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask a supplementary question, Mr President. I did not imply at all in the question, nor would I, that Australia should become a member of NAFTA. So the last part of the Minister's reply was really quite irrelevant. The fact remains that last year we exported 120,000 tonnes of sugar to the US, and the projected imports from Mexico are 150,000 tonnes after six years.

Of course, I make these comments as someone who actually worked in Kakadu National Park for eight years before I got into politics. Parks do need to be managed. As usual, only half the story has been told. I am pleased to advise the Senate of the other half. The park's plan of management, which is legally binding on the management of ANPWS, explicitly forbids events such as car rallies being held in the park, which is not surprising. Therefore, there was no discretion at all for the park management, under their plan of management, to have allowed this rally to occur in the way it was proposed, anyway.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things the inquiry will have to do if it decides that there should be a further investment in a new reactor is to determine where that new reactor should be, whether it should be at Lucas Heights or somewhere else.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This particular issue has been under consideration by the Australian Government for some time. It does underline the difficulties of getting trade liberalisation from the United States in a bilateral agricultural area. Really, the problem will not be great in the first six years, I think it must be conceded, because in that time it affects only a fraction of the Australian trade. The tariff reduction period for sugar is the longest phase-out period of any product in the NAFTA area, being 15 years. Also, there are other arrangements which are contingent and conditional with regard to this matter. It is not easy to try to predict the trade consequences with regard to NAFTA and sugar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment Mexico is a net importer of sugar and it has an undeveloped sugar industry. The US sugar regime applies a tariff quota to all imports. Naturally, once one gets outside the quota area, as Senator Boswell would know, the tariff makes any exports to the United States virtually impossible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's allocation for the 1992-93 marketing year is 96,786 tonnes of sugar. The Mexican quota is 7,250 tonnes. Under NAFTA, over the first six years the Mexican quota can increase from 7,250 tonnes to 25,000 tonnes. One would have to say that is an exceptionally marginal change. The crunch point comes after the six year period because then the quantity allowed from Mexico would be 150,000 tonnes. Clearly, in six years time, this would trigger a major difficulty for Australia. After that, the quota can continue to grow at 10 per cent per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of this is dependent on Mexico being a net exporter. However, what will probably happen, as I think Senator Boswell has indicated in his question, is that corn sweeteners from the USA will probably pour into Mexico, in turn have an import substitution effect and in turn make it more likely that Mexico becomes a net exporter of sugar products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At every stage in the formulation of the NAFTA concept, through our congressional lobbyists and others in Washington, we have pressed the Americans on this point. We will continue to do so. We will also continue to try to protect our access to the Canadian market, which is far more substantial than it is to the US market. The real crunch point, though, comes when Congress looks at these proposals. That is when we will have to put in our maximum effort. The crunch point down the track comes in six years time.</PARA>

Does the Government consider it desirable for public policy to ensure that mothers with young children not be forced to stay in the paid work force or to re-enter it before they really want to? If so, why is it that, as a result of government policy, a one-income family of husband, wife and three children in receipt of an income just below average weekly earnings has suffered a 13 per cent drop in real disposable income over the last eight years? Do the most recent ABS employment statistics reveal that even more pressure is being exerted on those mothers to unwillingly enter the paid work force? What is the Government doing to reverse the disastrous situation which has seen, over the last 12 months, a quarter of a million full time, mainly male, jobs disappear?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This question has been raised here on numerous occasions&mdash;that is, the question of the sad and unfortunately high level of unemployment. We have commented on that on a number of occasions. The Budget was very much directed towards trying to alleviate that problem, as indeed was the One Nation statement in terms of the cost of business taxes and major structural projects which the Government intends should go ahead and which are designed to help with that problem. But the particular point of Senator Harradine's question, of course, comes back to the question of women in the work force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that Australia has a high participation rate of women in the work force compared with, for example, the United Kingdom, a country which has very high unemployment levels, and Canada and North America, which have high unemployment levels. We have a higher participation rate of women in the work force. The argument really is whether that is due to the reasons which Senator Harradine suggests or to a variety of social changes which have taken place in Australia over the last decade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In so far as the question about the particular change in real disposable income is concerned, that is a matter of considerable argument on the statistic.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. The question was not about women in the work force&mdash;that is a matter of choice by a large number of them. That is not the issue at all. I want to know whether the Government believes that it is desirable public policy to force women against their wishes&mdash;mothers with dependent young children&mdash;into the paid work force.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters I present the Committee's report entitled The Conduct of Elections: New Boundaries for Cooperation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no doubt that the conduct of elections is a matter of great interest to all members and senators.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is an unfortunate tendency to take for granted the fact that we have an electoral system which is:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">reliable, professional, free of corruption and independent of government or political influence;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">an electoral system in which the community can generally have confidence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is not so in many countries, and it is interesting to note how highly regarded our Australian electoral officers are when they are employed as advisers or observers in the conduct of elections in newly democratic systems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So the inquiry and its report The Conduct of Elections: New Boundaries for Cooperation should be seen in the context that both the Australian Electoral Commission and the various State commissions run consistently highly professional elections.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But we should always strive for better and more efficient ways of doing things and this is what the report is about.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While electoral systems as individual systems are efficient this cannot be said of the constitutional structure in which they operate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is much talk currently of the need for micro economic reform. One prominent figure went so far as to say that "every galah has an opinion on the subject". One of the areas most in need of micro economic reform is the Constitution. From an electoral standpoint there is something slightly absurd about the presence of eight electoral systems in a country of seventeen million people&mdash;with a ninth currently planned for the Australian Capital Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The inquiry set out boldly and perhaps over optimistically to look for sources of reform in one area, the conduct of elections. Despite the early fears of some, the Committee did not see this as a one way process. They were not obsessed, as some seemed to believe, with a Federal takeover of State sovereign rights. There was just as much discussion about proposals that the States run Federal elections as there was about the proposal that there should be one national electoral system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Perhaps Professor Hughes, the former Chief Electoral Commissioner was correct when he said in evidence:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The possibility of having only one set of electoral authorities, the States, was lost shortly after federation, when the Commonwealth chose to set up its own machinery on the ground that differences in the Federal and State electoral systems required different electoral officials to administer them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee became aware very early that a long history of tensions, mistrust and rivalry both between Federal and State institutions and, for that matter between State institutions themselves could not be overcome easily.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So the report is a compromise but a practical document containing 59 recommendations which the Committee believes are possible of achievement even given the seemingly impossible obstacles and antagonisms between the eight administrations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee found it difficult to make a comparative analysis of the costs of conducting elections across the eight electoral administrations, because of their different accounting and reporting procedures. However, it does appear that the costs incurred by the Australian Electoral Commission are relatively high. In this regard the impact of maintaining a permanent office in each Federal electoral division on the AEC's costs is significant. The cost of supporting the divisional network in the AEC's State head offices and central office add further to the total cost of a permanent divisional structure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The divisional network has been subjected to scrutiny on several occasions, but has managed to survive the `rationalisation' which has been the lot of the public service generally. The Committee believes that the interests of the electorate are best served by retaining a dedicated returning officer for each Federal division within a reorganised divisional network. Savings in infrastructure costs would result. Several recommendations in the report address how this might be achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Grouping some divisional returning officers and their support staff in regional offices, or collocating two or more divisional returning officers and support staff, would be a sensible reorganisation in metropolitan and major provincial centres. Decisions on how to reorganise particular offices ought to be based on costs and on benefits and convenience to electors. The operational requirements of particular divisional offices are more relevant to the concept of reorganisation than the development and application of a set staffing entitlement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The topic of resource sharing between the State electoral commissions and the Australian Electoral Commission did not produce as much excitement as the divisional returning officers and the electoral rolls did. Nevertheless it was a most productive term of reference in relation to suggestions for improvements aimed at making voting more `user-friendly'. Twenty-seven of the report's fifty-nine recommendations relate to increasing and enhancing resource sharing between State commissions and the AEC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee addressed two main issues in considering how resource sharing between the Commonwealth and the States might improve voter convenience.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the first is the confusion that many voters experience when they discover that Federal and State elections are conducted by different electoral administrations. This confusion is apparent when voters at State electoral events expect assistance at Federal divisional returning offices. The confusion is exacerbated when people attempt to cast pre-poll and postal votes across electoral systems. The number of people being denied assistance or information on the grounds that they have visited or phoned the `wrong' office will be significantly decreased if the Committee's recommendations are adopted.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the second area of resource sharing which could enhance voter convenience is that of polling procedures. Within the limits of differing relevant electoral acts there is scope for some standardisation. This would be more convenient for voters and for polling officials who often work for both Federal and State administrations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other resource sharing recommendations address administrative procedures; the use of common returning officers and polling staff; staff training and development; and electoral research and education.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee gave serious consideration to the possibility of establishing a single electoral body to conduct all Federal and State elections. The concept was favoured by many of the AEC's divisional staff. Their support reflected the fact that they are in the front line of attack when would-be voters experience the confusion and inconvenience caused by the existence of separate electoral bodies in Federal and State jurisdictions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite the fact that many of the arguments in favour of a single electoral body were persuasive, it was obvious that the concept could never command a level of acceptance necessary to introduce it, even on a limited or experimental basis. Most States were implacably opposed to the idea of a single body, though some offered to conduct Federal elections on behalf of the Commonwealth within the particular State.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The electoral roll and the dissatisfaction of some of the States with the roll maintenance service provided by the Australian Electoral Commission, were dominant issues in the inquiry. A fourth term of reference was added after the initial advertising of the inquiry, in order to accommodate the States' concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From the beginning of the inquiry it was obvious that there was intense interest in both the costs and methods of maintaining the electoral roll. For all States and Territories except South Australia, the Australian Electoral Commission collects the data and compiles the roll using a computer roll management system called `RMANS'. The fact that the `user pays' principle is now being applied to electoral roll maintenance, and the increasing sophistication of computer technology has put RMANS under close scrutiny. Some States expressed concern at the lack of consultation about roll maintenance issues, including the development of RMANS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee took these concerns seriously and gave much attention to them as it considered its recommendations, designed to improve the national management of our rolls.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends the establishment of an Australian Joint Roll Council, to consist of representatives from all electoral administrations, to oversee roll management. The council could also address other matters of concern to more than one electoral administration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To complement the Australian Joint Roll Council the Committee recommends a ministerial council of Ministers responsible for electoral matters in each legislature.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee stopped short of recommending that the Australian Electoral Commission be expanded to include one of the State electoral commissioners in rotation, although we have recommended that this be placed before the ministerial council. If approved, this expansion of the AEC would provide a substantial voice for the interests of roll users.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The unfavourable views some States hold regarding the AEC's divisional network were raised in relation to the cost of roll maintenance. As the States have been asked to pay half the direct costs of maintaining the roll, some of them placed on record their concern about the roll's reliance on the network of divisional returning offices in each Federal electorate. Some States see the maintenance of a permanent field structure as an unnecessary and costly administrative practice&mdash;one which they decline to support financially, even if the support is indirect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effectiveness of `habitation reviews' or as they are now called&mdash;`electoral roll reviews' in cleansing the roll also came in for some criticism from the States. The Committee recommends that the proposed Australian Joint Roll Council consider alternatives to habitation reviews. For the present, the timing of roll reviews should reflect the electoral timetable of the States as well as that of the Commonwealth. The funding of electoral roll reviews should reflect the purpose of the particular review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the outset of this inquiry the Committee had no idea that it would wander through such an intricate labyrinth of administrative and technical detail. Particularly in relation to the costs and methods of maintaining the roll, what appeared on the surface to require a review of policy in fact demanded investigation of major questions of personnel management, intergovernmental relations and detailed technical information. The Committee trusts that the inquiry has provided a useful forum for these issues, and that the resulting report will contribute to workable solutions to existing problems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee was assisted in its task by two expert advisers&mdash;Mr Mike Duff, the South Australian Deputy Electoral Commissioner and Mr Tim Glanville, the Deputy Australian Electoral Officer for Victoria. I would like to place on record the Committee's appreciation of the contribution made by both advisers to our understanding of the intricacies of electoral administration. We thank them very much.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thanks should also be directed to Laurie Brereton the former Chairman of the Committee and to Bev Forbes the former Secretary for the work they did during the early days of this inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would also like to thank the current Committee staff, the Secretary Judy Middlebrook and her assistant Frances Coates for their skill, dedication and willingness to help, and the Chairman Arch Bevis who managed to weave his way through a complex web of claims and counter claims to achieve a bi-partisan report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I commend the report to the Senate.</PARA>

My main reason for proposing this Bill is that it is a measure which has the potential to considerably improve the health of Australians. It also has the potential to reduce the cost to the community of providing medical care to the victims of tobacco-related illnesses. It is not appropriate that tobacco and alcohol be included in the basket of goods and services that is used to calculate the index of prices that are paid by the average Australian consumer. The majority of Australians do not use tobacco, and alcohol usage is incidental to daily sustenance. If these products are removed from the CPI calculations, a major immediate effect would be to liberate the taxing authority from any concerns that increasing excises or taxes would be inflationary.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The primary purpose of this Bill is to amend the Australian Industry Development Corporation Act 1970 to extend the Commonwealth guarantee until 30 June 1998, as announced in November last year. This Bill will also clarify issues relating to the AIDC's trading powers and reduce the size of its Board. The extension of the Commonwealth guarantee to 30 June 1998 will have no net effect on revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Background</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AIDC, the Corporation, is a Government Business Enterprise which was established in the early seventies. In 1989 the operations of the Corporation were changed: a new company, AIDC Ltd, was floated on the Australian Stock Exchange. The Corporation retains an 81 per cent interest in AIDC Ltd.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AIDC Ltd has taken over the investing operations formerly carried out by the Corporation. It operates in a commercial manner without Government direction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under a management arrangement between the Corporation and AIDC Ltd, the Corporation is the borrower on behalf of AIDC Ltd. The AIDC Act allows for AIDC borrowings to be guaranteed by the Commonwealth. At 30 June 1992 the amount of borrowings guaranteed by the Commonwealth stood at around $2.7 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Guarantee</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AIDC Act currently provides for the Commonwealth guarantee on AIDC borrowings to expire on 30 June 1994. This Bill amends s35 of that Act to implement the Government's decision to extend the guarantee to 30 June 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is also a need to clarify the Commonwealth's obligation to AlDC's borrowings made during the operation of the Commonwealth guarantee, but which are subsequently rolled over into a further investment. These amendments ensure that the guarantee does not continue on moneys reinvested after the statutory limit on the Commonwealth guarantee has expired.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reduction in AIDC Board</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present the Board of AIDC is composed of a Chairman, the Chief Executive of the Corporation, the Secretaries of the Departments of Industry, Technology and Commerce, and Primary Industry and Energy. At present the statutory minimum number of other directors is between 4 and 8.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AIDC is now basically a holding corporation with the AIDC Ltd as the operating company of the group. Indeed, since 1990 AIDC has been managed by AIDC Ltd under an agreement between them. Accordingly, the requirement for a large Board is no longer appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is proposed that the number of `other' directors who may be appointed be reduced to one.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Power of AIDC to enter into swaps and other financial transactions</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A UK court ruling has called into question the power of statutory corporations to enter into certain financial arrangements such as interest rate swaps, foreign exchange agreements, forward rate agreements, options, futures, or hedge agreements. Given AlDC's role as a corporation operating in financial markets it is important to have its powers clearly defined. These amendments make it clear that the AIDC has these powers.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF PROCESS BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 5 March 1992, the Honourable Peter Duncan MP, Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General, introduced a Service and Execution of Process Bill in the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Second Reading speech introducing the Bill, the Parliamentary Secretary said that the Bill was an important law reform measure and that Honourable Members, the States and Territories, the legal profession and other interested persons should have an adequate time to examine it before debate. He welcomed comments and suggestions on the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comments were received on that Bill from State and Territory agencies (with whose operations the Bill is most concerned) and from other persons and bodies. As a result of these comments and consultation with State and Territory agencies some changes to improve either understanding of the Bill or its operation were identified. While the changes were few many amendments, mostly consequential or drafting amendments, would have been needed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has decided it would be simpler to introduce a new Bill rather than amend the Bill introduced in the House of Representatives in March. Accordingly, this Bill has been introduced in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will replace the Service and Execution of Process Act 1901. That Act was one of the earliest enactments of this Parliament, in fact, Act No.11 of 1901, showing the importance accorded to provision for interstate service and execution of process on the creation of the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill largely implements recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in its report on Service and Execution of Process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Act now provides for&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">interstate service of court and other process;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">interstate service and enforcement of subpoenas;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">bringing prisoners interstate to give evidence;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">interstate enforcement of civil judgments of courts;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">interstate arrest and return of persons to face criminal charges; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">interstate enforcement of lower court fines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reference to the Law Reform Commission which led to its report was given by the Hon. Neil Brown QC on behalf of the Attorney-General in 1982. The reference resulted both from concern that the Act was in need of reform, and from suggestions from several State Attorneys-General that the Act should be extended to the process and decisions of tribunals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The State Attorneys were concerned that process issued by tribunals, such as a consumer claims tribunal, effectively stopped at State borders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In its report the Law Reform Commission found that, while the Act had remained largely unchanged, changes in Australian society since 1901 have been dramatic. Business outlook is increasingly national and, for many purposes, State and Territory boundaries have become artificial and even meaningless.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reflecting these findings, the Commission recommended a major updating of the procedures in the Act, and their extension to the process and decisions of tribunals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Act is, of course, concerned with the effective operation of State and Territory process and so of State and Territory bodies&mdash;the courts, police and correctional authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, the Government has carried out an extensive and detailed program of consultation with the States and Territories about the Law Reform Commission's recommendations, and about proposals to improve on those recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has been particularly concerned to focus on the practical application of its recommendations for State and Territory courts and agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With respect to civil proceedings in courts, the Bill greatly simplifies procedures for the interstate service of process and enforcement of judgments. In particular&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill sets out an exclusive method for interstate service of process. At present a plaintiff can use procedures under the Service and Execution of Process Act, or under State laws. This can cause problems especially where a plaintiff attempts to use part of the procedures under the Act and part of the State procedures in the one proceeding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill adopts the Corporations Law rules for service on companies, and the same rules for service interstate on natural persons as apply for service intrastate of similar process on natural persons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Safeguards are set out relating to minimum time limits for interstate service of initiating process and subpoenas, and to the payment of expenses for interstate witnesses. Provision is made for notices to be attached to subpoenas setting out the rights and obligations of the person served.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No endorsement will be needed on process commencing a proceeding against a person in another State. Solicitors will be able to use the one document for service anywhere in Australia, supplemented by an information notice as prescribed when service is interstate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Also abolished by the Bill is the need for a particular connection between the cause of action and the State in which proceedings are commenced. Instead, the Bill provides for a stay of proceedings in an inferior court where there is a more appropriate forum to determine the matters in dispute between the parties. Combined with the cross-vesting legislation which provides, amongst other things, for transfer of proceedings between Supreme Courts, this will enable cases to be determined in the most convenient forum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill abolishes the requirement to obtain leave to serve a subpoena interstate. It also provides improved procedures for the making and determination of applications for relief from interstate subpoenas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Bill judgments can be enforced interstate by a simple registration procedure in the appropriate interstate court. The judgment will be registered on lodgment of a sealed copy of the judgment, or of a fax of a sealed copy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One area where the Bill diverges significantly from the Law Reform Commission's recommendations is the interstate service of subpoenas on persons who are under some kind of restraint which affects their ability to comply with the subpoena.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Examples include persons on bail subject to reporting requirements, on parole, home detention, periodic detention or various forms of alternative sentencing options.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A person subject to a restraint which might be breached if he or she complied with an interstate subpoena will be required where State law permits, in the first instance, to apply under State law for `consent' to comply with the subpoena (for example, where a witness is on bail, by applying to a court to vary his or her bail conditions). If no `consent' is given a warrant can be issued and a magistrate will decide whether the person should go interstate on bail or in custody.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also provides for interstate service and execution of process of State and Territory tribunals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Honourable Senators will recall that the Law Reform Commission's recommendation for procedures to enable the interstate service of subpoenas issued by investigative tribunals was implemented last year by the Service and Execution of Process Amendment Act 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Bill initiating process issued by a tribunal performing an adjudicative function of the kind specified in the Bill can be served interstate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This includes a tribunal performing a disciplinary function, for example, a tribunal determining whether a person is a fit and proper person to carry on a particular profession.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Judgments of tribunals performing an adjudicative function will be enforceable interstate by registration in a court in the same manner as judgments of a court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will be possible for subpoenas issued by tribunals to be served interstate where leave is obtained from a court, judge or magistrate. Differing requirements apply about who may give leave depending upon the function being exercised by the tribunal and its jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will streamline procedures for the return of persons interstate to give evidence or to face criminal charges.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The requirement for interstate warrants to be endorsed by a judicial officer of the State of apprehension is abolished. The Bill also enables action to be taken on a copy of a warrant (including a fax copy). This removes the need for the issue of a provisional warrant while the original warrant is being sent interstate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill substantially reproduces Part IVA of the Act which provides for the interstate enforcement of lower court fines. Part IVA was inserted in 1963, has been subsequently amended, and was excluded from the reference to the Law Reform Commission. Minor changes have been made to ensure consistency with the rest of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill is expected to have no impact on Commonwealth expenditure or revenue.</PARA>

I want to place on record an account of two people, one who has died recently and one who sets an example of families whom I think we need to acknowledge in this country.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed he was a great bloke. I thank Minister Bolkus. I thought he and I would have had our butcher in common. Lou Cimarosti was born in 1928 in Gilbert Street in inner city Adelaide of parents who had migrated from Italy. I have not really discovered what it was that led to a significant migration of Italian people at that time to Adelaide. Lou grew up there, went to a nearby primary school and became apprenticed to the butcher in that very same street. Subsequently he became the owner of that butcher shop. I got to know him when my children were going to a nearby kindergarten and child-care centre. It was this butcher shop that provided the meat for the child-care centre. It was quality meat and quality customer service and I have stayed there ever since.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The butcher shop is one of those that has sawdust on the floor and a chopping block. You can have your meat taken off the bone while you are there. One tiny story illustrates best what sort of people Lou Cimarosti and his family were. One day I was in the butcher shop with a number of other people when in rushed somebody to say, `Quick, quick. Old Mrs X down the road has been found unconscious in her garden'. The butcher took off his apron and so did his assistant, and off they went to help attend to this lady. `Please wait,' he said, `but if not, come  back later'. It took about 10 minutes but in some small way the idea of downing tools to go and help somebody in the community who had been caught in very distressing circumstances illustrates exactly the sort of person Lou Cimarosti was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was highly involved in community work. He had a way of making people feel welcome in his shop. He and his family were very much committed to the idea of participating in the community, but in a nice, old-fashioned way. You did it because it was mannerly, you did it because it was polite and civil to do. As a result, he had very extensive custom. A lot of people wanted to go there. We enjoyed meeting and catching up with each other there. I take the opportunity to acknowledge those very best old-fashioned qualities that sometimes get overlooked or ignored in our galloping society. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I extend my sympathy again to the family of Lou Cimarosti and acknowledge his great contribution in a modest and humble way to the city of Adelaide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My first story was about death; the second is of life. One of the pleasures I have had is occasionally being driven by a Commonwealth driver in South Australia, Mr O'Grady. That is not to distinguish him from any other Commonwealth driver, all of whom look after me splendidly. What distinguishes Mr O'Grady is that he is the father of an Olympian silver medallist. From time to time</PARA>
<PARA>his son rode in the team cycling pursuit. I am happy to acknowledge that, but one of the things we overlook when we are talking about medallists and representatives of Australia at the Olympic Games is the sorts of families that have backed them, the whole range of family backgrounds, but in particular the contribution of parents to the achievements of their children, whatever age those children are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to acknowledge the contribution of wives, husbands, sons and daughters&mdash;indeed, a lot of relatives&mdash;to the coaching, training and committed effort of athletes. I would like to suggest that it is worth our thinking from time to team about the families behind the medallists and, in particular, to know that they are as varied and as generous as, for example, is illustrated by a Commonwealth driver colleague, Mr O'Grady in South Australia. I simply wanted to acknowledge that in the Senate here today. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator Collins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Installation of a television translator facility at Razorback Lookout (Pigabeen), designed to serve areas to the south of Tweed Heads with five television services (three commercials, ABC-TV, and SBS-TV) was initiated, but the facility has never been commissioned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) It is now unlikely that such a translator facility will be commissioned, for the following reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the early 1980s it was thought that, owing to the nature of the terrain in the Gold Coast/Tweed Heads district, low-power `in-fill' translator facilities would be required at Mt Tamborine, Farrell Lookout (Currumbin), and Razorback Lookout, in order to provide adequate reception of the Brisbane commercial television services throughout the district.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time, the Tweed Heads area lay in both the service area of the Brisbane commercial television stations (BTQ, QTQ, and TVQ), and the service area of RTN Richmond/Tweed. These four commercial services began transmitting from a translator on Mt Tamborine in 1983, and were joined by ABC-TV and SBS-TV in 1985. All of these commercial and national services began transmitting from Farrell Lookout in 1988.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The translator at Razorback Lookout was to be commissioned later, to serve any areas around Tweed Heads which were not being served by the Mt Tamborine and Farrell Lookout facilities, or by the various parent stations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence of the decision to include the Tweed Heads area in the Television Equalisation program, so that it would be served by NBN (Nine Network) and NEN (Seven Network), as well as NRN (Ten Network), this region was excluded from the Brisbane licensees' service areas. Thus the Brisbane stations were no longer eligible to transmit from Razorback Lookout.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many viewers in the Tweed Heads area have invested in mast-head amplifiers and high-gain antennas in order to receive the Brisbane stations' signals from Mt Coot-tha (the parent stations) or from Mt Tamborine. When test transmissions were made from Razorback Lookout in October 1990, the relatively strong `local' signals seriously disrupted the viewers' long distance reception of the Brisbane stations, and no further transmissions have since been made from Razorback Lookout.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A signal strength survey of the Tweed Heads area was conducted in May 1992, following establishment of the Prime (UHF 44) and NBN (UHF 47) transmission facilities on Mt Nardi.
