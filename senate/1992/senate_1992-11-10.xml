<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister representing the Prime Minister to the astonishing press release put out by the Prime Minister today on the mass industrial action in Victoria.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a couple of ageing rockers around that listen to Triple J too, particularly on Saturday afternoons when that network presents what I think is probably the best comedy currently available in Australia. But I am happy to advise the Senate that Triple J, the ABC's youth network, is currently the fastest growing radio service in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since its expansion to each capital city and Newcastle just over two years ago, Triple J now attracts more than one million listeners each week. In the past year the growth rate for this multiple award winning radio service has consistently averaged 40,000 new listeners every two months. The popularity of Triple J lies in its capacity to provide a unifying identity for young Australians through new music and youth culture. It is widely recognised at both industry and government levels as providing major support for the Australian music industry. For example, Triple J has been credited with bringing Australian bands, including Midnight Oil, INXS and the Northern Territory's own Yothu Yindi, to national and international prominence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current policy is to broadcast at least 35 per cent Australian produced music, with an emphasis on providing exposure to high quality new talent. In addition, Triple J provides news and current affairs programs, sport, comedy and a broad range of information based programming identifying other issues relevant to young people, such as employment, health, education and the environment. The Federal Government remains totally committed to supporting Triple J. In contrast, the Federal coalition, in writing, seems determined to close it down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Broadcasting Corporation board yesterday issued a considered response to the proposed $56m recurrent funding cut proposed by the coalition under Fightback and said that some services would go. Some members of the coalition at least are nominating which ones. I have in my possession a letter from Senator O'Chee, the National Party's self-styled champion of Australian youth, to the Mayor of Rockhampton, dated 6 October. Senator O'Chee says in his letter that the ABC suggested at a recent meeting with National Party senators that the coalition's proposed funding cuts would oblige the closure of one or more of its three radio networks, Radio National, ABC Regional or Triple J. Senator O'Chee says in his letter that, whilst the coalition does not accept this assertion:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . if that were the case then we believe it should be Triple J. . . </PARA>
<PARA>that is closed down. Senator O'Chee, the self-styled voice of conservative youth in Australia, is proposing to close down what is currently the nation's most successful youth radio network. Senator O'Chee uses the word `we'. I presume it is not the royal `we', but means either the National Party or the coalition. He says:</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. Over the past week Syntec has warned that Australia faces another major economic downturn within two years because of a looming current account crisis. The National Australia Bank has warned that business has scaled back its expectations for growth and investment for next year. The Australian Bureau of Statistics figures have revealed that consumer spending has weakened. The ABS found that one in four families in Australia have no family member employed. I ask the Minister: in view of these appalling figures, what estimate has the Government made of losses of jobs, income and production of this Keating endorsed strike in Victoria?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have introduced complete flexibility into the Industrial Relations Act. The agreements coming through at workplace level show that there is a surge of productivity building up because of those changes. We have succeeded in presiding over a period in which strike action in Australia is tailing right off. It is 61 per cent below what it was in a comparative period under Fraser, when the coalition was in office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unit labour costs have fallen dramatically. Productivity has increased. Increasingly, best practice is a feature of Australian workplaces.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I again ask the Minister: in view of the appalling economic conditions in Australia and the basket case that is Victoria because of the actions of the previous Premier, Mr Halfpenny and other people within the trade union movement, and the fact that one family in four does not have a breadwinner, what estimate has the Government made of losses of jobs, income and production as a result of the strike in Victoria which has clearly been endorsed by the Prime Minister, Mr Keating?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Kennett industrial dispute in Victoria is having a damaging effect on the Victorian economy. The Government does not in any way relish that; it is a tragedy for Victorians. But responsibility for this has to be taken by someone. In this case, it is quite clearly due to the Opposition's and, in Victoria, the Kennett Government's pursuit of the industrial relations policies that they have embraced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How does one get recovery in a country such as Australia? One gets recovery by working with Australians to be more productive, by providing access to schools and training and by creating a cooperative culture. The Opposition may believe that it can get cooperation by confrontation, by taking rights off Australians and by lowering incomes to families. What is clear is that there needs to be a boost in demand in the economy to lift purchasing power. The Opposition does the reverse: it undermines confidence and then blames the victims as if it was their fault.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is not a bad joke, but it was much funnier when I read it in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">News of the World</EMPHASIS> 10 years ago. Anything from Senator Baume is recycled. This compares well with larger businesses which managed employment growth of only 1.4 per cent per year due to the recession and, of course, due to structural adjustment in larger businesses with many of them having reduced their levels of middle management and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to whether or not that pattern can be maintained, the current tax system provides benefits to small businesses that, for example, a goods and services tax would remove. A goods and services tax means that small businesses which are exempt from payroll tax and do not pay wholesale sales tax would be subject to the GST that replaces them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The payroll tax system has exemptions for small businesses and therefore provides a factor preserving small business. The threshold varies between $320,000 in Western Australia and $500,000 in New South Wales. Eighty-five per cent of Australian businesses do not pay payroll tax. Seven hundred thousand currently exempt small businesses would be liable for a goods and services tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wholesale sales tax system has around 75,000 taxpayers this year. The changes introduced in the streamlining process this year&mdash;and we have discussed the legislation here in the Senate&mdash;mean that many of these businesses need no longer collect and remit tax. That means that 700,000 small firms would have to collect and pay a GST.</PARA>

It is law administered by the Industrial Relations Commission, a layman's court where individuals can go and argue their case and where the Commission is familiar with industrial circumstances and can make a wise decision based on reality. Alternatively, they can go to the Industrial Court and have their matter dealt with, depending on the nature of it, before a court dealing with the legal implications of awards. In all jurisdictions, there is no ability to victimise employees because if membership of a union is used as a reason for dismissal people can be returned to employment on that basis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Unlike with common law, there is no master and servant relationship under industrial law. The archaic law that applies in common law deems that the relationship between an employer and an employee is that of a master and a servant, and that it is for the master to propose and dispose, and merely for the servant to obey. If the master wishes to dismiss, no matter what the circumstances, the master has untrammelled rights in the common law. The industrial law is not tyrannical, is not harsh in that sense and, as I say, can deal realistically with the circumstances that are thrown up in the working life of all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other big disadvantage of the common law is the cost. It is a high cost jurisdiction requiring expensive lawyers' fees to access it. The further disability with it, of course, is the delay. There is a considerable delay in getting before the ordinary courts of this country on matters and, of course, after a high cost, long delay wait, one is then faced with law in the nature in which it appears that does not bestow rights on individuals and in fact deems them to be masters and servants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not going to adopt the policies of the Opposition on this. One of the reasons we believe we ought not to do that relates to this proposal, ludicrous and peculiar though it be, to establish an Office of the Employee Advocate. It is not an office which would help people negotiate their individual work agreements. It is only a legalistic office&mdash;which could become the largest law firm in Australia&mdash;which effectively would simply tell workers that they do not have any rights at common law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Compare that to what applies now. My Department dealt with 17,500 matters of complaint and recovered over $6m in underpayment of wages or working conditions last year&mdash;and it did it without going to the courts. It did it because it went and negotiated and obtained the agreement from employers to pay those rights. The Office of the Employee Advocate would have no such powers. It would be strictly a legalistic authority and it would be dealing with many applications presented to workers on the basis that, `If you don't sign this workplace agreement, you'll be sacked'. If they are sacked because they refuse to sign, no award will help them, no commission will help them, and they will have no rights.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Leaving aside the hocus-pocus the Opposition wants to play with how youth unemployment is properly calculated and presented, given the figures that have now been presented here&mdash;and leaving aside the Opposition's normal flippancy with these figures&mdash;I cannot confirm those figures and they seem to me, frankly, to be inaccurate. What is true about youth unemployment in this country is that it is coming down and that the level of youth unemployment is lower, on a proper measure, than the level of adult unemployment. If there is a priority in dealing with the unemployed, it is dealing with more mature aged people who are unemployed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not accept&mdash;and this should be stated clearly and unequivocally&mdash;the implication of this question at all. If the Victorian Government is concerned to see a recovery in Victoria, then why does it think confrontation with ordinary Australians will help it be achieved? When Mr Howard and Mr Reith respectively have said on the programs <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS> on Channel Ten and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program on Channel 9 a fortnight ago that the Government of Victoria lied to the people of Victoria before the election and did after the election what it promised not to do, why does it think that ordinary Australians would not protest and use an inherent democratic right to withdraw labour to do so? When Mr Gude, the Leader of the House, goes on television and says he needs a wage rise in order to compensate him for the hard work in which he is engaged in ripping benefits off ordinary people and imposing a poll tax, why does it think that ordinary Australians would not protest? But, more pernicious than all that, why would not ordinary families in Australia object to having a unilateral reduction in their income, a reduction in the wages that they bring home, simply because that Government believes that making Australians worse off will somehow engender a recovery?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is, as I said earlier in an answer to a question, that there is a need to boost demand in the Australian economy. If anything, that is a case for a wage improvement, generated hopefully by productivity, rather than simply a reduction in wages.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My colleague Senator McMullan interjected, to paraphrase him, `See previous answers'. Indeed, that is probably the most sensible answer I can give. This question is trotted out with singlemindedness from the Opposition. What has never been answered by the Opposition is how it thinks confrontation is going to engender a spirit of cooperation to solve the economic problems of Victoria. Even though Mr Howard and Mr Reith do not support the Kennett Government and have said that the Liberal Government in Victoria has lied to the electorate, nonetheless the effort is constant here today to shift the blame on to the victims and to accuse them that somehow the Kennett industrial dispute is their fault.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat what I said in answer to an earlier question. The most sensible course in Victoria, now that the Kennett Government has recognised that there is a need for 50-plus further amendments to its own legislation&mdash;although it has not said what those amendments are&mdash;now that it has recognised that its legislation is grievously flawed, is for the Government to withdraw the legislation. It can then seek a meeting of all parties in Victoria, employers and unions, to thrash out a recovery scheme for Victoria to which all parties believe they can affirm, commit and help work through. That would be an exercise in cooperation and team building and in getting a community approach to resolve the problems, and that includes the problems of unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that the Kennett Government deliberately chooses to eschew that option and go on another course&mdash;a course of inviting social division, disharmony and confrontation, a course which is aimed at lowering the living standards of ordinary Victorian families&mdash;indicates a militant disregard for the State interest, with a serious knock-on effect to the national interest.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On today's evidence, over the next six months nobody is going to be taking much notice of this or any other aspect of foreign policy. But let me answer the question as best I can on the basis of the talks I have just returned from in Beijing over the weekend. The situation, I think, can be summarised in these terms: while the situation in Cambodia does continue to be fragile, the peace process has not broken down, nor is it in danger of imminent collapse. The weekend talks were convened by the Indonesian and French Foreign Ministers in their capacity as co-chairmen of the Paris Conference. They were attended by Prince Sihanouk and the leaders of all the Cambodian factions, plus representatives from the P5 countries and the other five countries that are most immediately involved in this. I attended as representative of Australia. Those talks were essentially part of a process of consultation leading up to the next crucial stage in this affair, which is the consideration of the Cambodian issue by the Security Council of the United Nations, which is expected to take place next week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In so far as the position of the Khmer Rouge is concerned, notwithstanding some rather breathless reporting that initially came out of Beijing, the talks really did no more than confirm what has been evident for some weeks&mdash;namely, that the Khmer Rouge propose to continue indefinitely their policy of non-participation in the peace process. As I said, the next step is for the Security Council, following the receipt of reports from the co-chairmen and the Secretary-General, to determine how to respond to this situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issues that will need to be addressed in this context include arrangement for the conduct of elections without Khmer Rouge participation; modification of existing military arrangements in light of the cantonment, disarmament and demobilisation phase of the peace plan being unable to be fully implemented; and possible additional measures to encourage compliance with the settlement process. There was quite a lot of discussion in Beijing of these issues. It is fair to say that Australia played a very significant coordinating role in developing a series of quite specific proposals for consideration by the Security Council next week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will summarise overall by saying just this. Notwithstanding the difficulties that the Khmer Rouge continue to pose for the peace process, notwithstanding the uncertainty that still unquestionably exists as to whether their intransigence will take a passive&mdash;as is the case at the moment&mdash;or a rather more aggressive form in the future, there are still plenty of grounds for optimism that the basic elements of the peace plan can be carried through. In particular, I refer first to the major achievements of UNTAC to date in maintaining overall peace, in implementing voter registration and other electoral arrangements and in returning now something like 180,000 displaced persons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, there is the continuing cooperation of other countries in not rearming the Khmer Rouge or other factions, which would not be guaranteed without this whole peace process. Thirdly, and finally, there is the continuing unanimity and determination of the international community to see elections proceed on schedule in April or May next year, with or without the Khmer Rouge.</PARA>

We do know what he was working hard at.

But contributions should be made in such a way that all members of the community contribute according to their ability to pay. Mr Kennett should not hit the low and middle income earners and, in the same breath, with breath-taking arrogance, raise the salaries of his Ministers.

As a result, there is no parliamentary check on what the government of the day can do. So what is left for people to do? The only thing they can do is take to the streets and make sure that the Government knows how they feel about the victimisation of middle and low income earners. </PARA>

Even some of the Labor Party senators opposite are trying to distance themselves from that Government&mdash;not very successfully, I might say.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Are Senator Cook and his Labor colleagues trying to tell the Australian people that the Victorian Government, which was elected to attempt to wipe out the dreadful malaise that Victoria has had over the last 10 years, is not to be allowed to take that action because John Halfpenny and a bunch of people who have been the recipients of largess from Senator Cook and his Government totalling $50m in the past eight or nine years are to be allowed to run the State? If that is to happen instead of the task being given to the present Victorian Government which has been democratically elected, I think the people of Australia will regard that with total horror, and will not have a bar of what Senator Cook is saying. Therefore, if it is such an important matter, which it is, the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders ought to be agreed to so that we can have the substantive debate that this subject&mdash;more than most others in recent times&mdash;deserves. </PARA>

The Act takes away a person's right to claim at common law for any injury that constitutes less than 30 per cent of the whole person as judged by the American Medical Association guidelines. The tragedy of that is that if, through no fault of a worker but through the negligence of the employer&mdash;even the gross negligence of the employer&mdash;a person loses a leg beneath the knee or loses an eye, or has to have an operation on his or her back two years after the accident has occurred, he or she cannot sue the negligent employer.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the motion proposed by the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Hill. The question that Senator Hill put to Senator Button at the start of Question Time today was very clear. In my view Senator Button replied by saying that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) endorsed this strike. I do not believe there is any way that we can read the press release that Senator Cook has tabled other than that there is a strong endorsement by the Prime Minister of the strike in Victoria, a strike which is attempting to cause chaos and job losses and to overturn a mandate of a government elected, as Senator Short said, just some weeks ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In debating this motion for the suspension of Standing Orders, suddenly Senator Cook attempted to back away from the endorsement. It was very clear to people on our side. Perhaps Senator Cook had heard that the strike had not gone so well. Perhaps he had heard that the numbers marching in the street were not one million, 100,000 or 70,000. Apparently, according to one report, they were 30,000. These figures will be revealed in time. Perhaps Senator Cook read the AAP cable which came out about 12.30 p.m. which said that most sectors of Victorian industry were working and had not been affected by this Keating-Halfpenny strike. Perhaps Senator Cook then decided that it was time to back-pedal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, Keating, Cook and their ilk are fully involved in this strike. There can be no doubt about it. The Labor Party is the political arm of the trade union movement.

We have just been informed by the press in the last week that the ACTU will spend some $1m campaigning against the Liberal and National parties' policy on industrial relations as we go to the next election. I ask you to reflect on that, Mr President: the ACTU will spend $1m to campaign against the Liberal Party. This Government has given some $12m to the ACTU since 1983.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button), in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Short on 9 November 1992, relating to breaches of Australian Loan Council guidelines by the Victorian Government.</PARA>
<PARA>Yesterday, I asked Senator Button a question about the Victorian loan affair and the breaching by the Victorian Government of the Loan Council guidelines. As part of a very unsatisfactory answer, Senator Button undertook to provide me today with details on whether any Minister or official of the Federal Government had any formal or informal discussions with the Victorian Government or its officials about Victoria's breach of the Loan Council guidelines before 17 June, whether any letter drafted by the Victorians was sighted, and whether discussions were held on such a letter before that date. Today, as I understood his answer to me, Senator Button said that the first time the Federal Treasury was aware of a draft letter&mdash;the existence of which only came to light over recent days after being extracted like a tooth from the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins)&mdash;was on 17 June when it was handed over by the Victorians at a meeting that was held that day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That answer is still quite unsatisfactory. It still does not tell us when the Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, first knew of the illegal breaching of the guidelines by the Victorian Government. That is a quite critical question that the Government, the Treasurer, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and, in this chamber, Senator Button, have studiously avoided answering. That was the purport of questions asked by Opposition senators in recent days. It is a question that demands an answer from the Government at the earliest possible date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition is also very concerned that the Government has refused to release other draft letters from the Victorian officials or Ministers, which were apparently handed over to the Treasury in June but the content of which has not seen the light of day either. Now we find a press report today, an article by Laura Tingle in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, which resulted from shadow Treasurer Peter Reith's persistent questioning of the Government yesterday on what other material existed. We find that that flushed out the Secretary of the Treasury yesterday, who confirmed that another briefing note was prepared over several days and sent to Mr Dawkins after still further meetings post 17 June. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that sounds confusing to listeners, that is because this whole matter has become increasingly confusing due to an obvious great reluctance by the Government to release all the information required to look at this matter carefully and fully. Yesterday, I asked Senator Button to release all of the official and unofficial material relating to this issue. He has not done so, and I call upon him again to do so. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button), in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Beahan this day, relating to taxation on small business.</PARA>
<PARA>In an answer to a dorothy dix question this afternoon, Senator Button attempted to answer an issue that I raised in the MPI yesterday, which was essentially the unevenness of the taxing point for wholesale sales tax purposes and the degree of unfairness and unevenness that inevitably creeps into this issue&mdash;an issue that is not a problem under the Liberal-National Party coalition's GST proposals because the essence of that tax is fairness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators would be aware of the large amount of litigation on this taxing point to determine a fair and a deemed wholesale sales price; that is, the price on which the sales tax is levied. The fair or deemed wholesale price nowadays is often quite difficult to determine because of the declining number of wholesalers, on the one hand, and, on the other, the increasing prevalence of sales direct by manufacturers to the large supermarket chains, as in the example of the wholesaler that I mentioned yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not only the anomalies in sales tax and the unfairness and unevenness of the tax vis-a-vis the impact it has on different types of customers, and its cascading effect, that have led to the decline in the number of wholesalers. That decline is also due to a number of other factors, such as discount buying and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the impact of sales tax is not the only factor. Nevertheless, it is a significant factor. It is one of the criticisms regarding the Government's continuance of a wholesale sales tax regime&mdash;a factor that does not exist under the GST proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the point I made yesterday. The K-Mart type operators cannot distinguish or identify those customers who represent final retail sales as against others who on-charge or on-sell the material. The example that I gave in the debate on the matter of public importance yesterday was that of an electrician. The example demonstrates the unfairness and unevenness of the sales tax. The little diagram which the Minister presented to me in demonstration of his answer was not correct because it is not the deemed selling price, the manufacturer's price plus his own wholesaling charges, but the deemed wholesale price that has to be dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order for his answer to be right, one would have to ask him whether the tax auditors insist that the manufacturers always calculate their sales tax at the manufacturer's level at a price to the wholesaler including margin plus manufacturing selling price and not necessarily on the bulk discounted price plus the handling charges. There are therefore a number of deemed wholesale prices&mdash;one at the ordinary wholesale level, which includes wholesaling profit, and the other charged by the manufacturer, which includes manufacturing costs plus a deemed uplift factor. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>In asking my question today, which I thought was rather a simple question, of the Leader of the Government in this place about unemployed people in Australia, it absolutely astounded and disappointed me that he did not know the numbers of unemployed. One would have thought that, as Leader of the Government, he would have known the answer. One would have thought that the Leader of the Government in this chamber would have known the cause of all those unemployed. He has had 10 years in government with the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who has been the Treasurer for most of that time. One would think that the Leader of the Government in this place would have some thoughts on the remedies he could give to this chamber regarding all those people who are unemployed, giving them some hope and also giving some hope to those who are employed who fear that they will go on to the unemployment scrap heap. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the figures were taken into account correctly&mdash;if all the unemployed and those who are not working 40 hours a week, those who are disillusioned and who are no longer registered and seeking work and all the other people who have become redundant from the work force lately were taken into account&mdash;I believe those figures would be closer to 1.5 million. They might even be higher. That is an indictment on the government of the day, the Labor Government. It is also an indictment of the Leader of the Labor Party in this chamber that he did not know the answers and was rather offhand in rejecting my question. If that is the way that this Government answers questions on unemployment, if it indicates the feeling this Government has for those who cannot get work and the heaps of school leavers who are about to come on line in the next month or two, then God help Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only way this situation is going to change is under a government which has a vision for the future, a government which will look forward and say that we have to change things because of the abysmal state of the economy, a government which will make changes to the labour market, to industrial relations and to the tax system and which will get people back to work again. Unless we have a vibrant economy, an economy that wants to employ people, we will not get people back to work. This Government stands condemned for the fact that the Leader of the Government in this place could not answer the question easily and also for the fact that he does not have a program for the future to get those people into jobs. </PARA>

<PARA>This is really a ministerial statement. It is headed `Ministerial Policy Paper' and it claims to state the Government's plans for the future in appropriating its aid vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is spending about $1,400m of taxpayers' money each year on foreign aid. Regrettably, a significant part of that sum is not going to those most in need, nor is the aid expenditure being properly monitored or accounted for. This is a serious issue and should be debated fully by the Parliament. As I said a moment ago, I regret that this debate is to be restricted in the terms that have been just mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debate on the issue for the forthcoming election is important. We have put down an alternative program which we have headed <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Foreign aid: blueprint for an improved program</EMPHASIS>. I table a copy of that document which I circulated to those interested about a week ago which, as I said, sets out an alternative aid program for Australia. It does, I readily admit, in the short term anyway, provide that we will be curtailed by a lesser sum. Basically, it is our view that at the moment Australia cannot afford $1,400m a year in the circumstances of its dire economic plight and therefore in government we would be restrained for some time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We set out in the Fightback document details of that restraint, which would be $209m over two years. Therein lies a distinction. When this Government came to office, it continually promised that it would increase the aid vote, but throughout the good years of the Hawke Government it in fact reduced aid in this country. In the past couple of years it has been able to maintain it basically stationary at that lower level so that now we have an aid appropriation considerably less than that which this Government inherited when the Fraser Government went out of office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet this Government has the gall to boast in this statement about the fact that it has been able to maintain the aid vote in the last year, whilst stressing the fact that we said we would have to reduce that sum. The distinction is therefore quite clearly in the question of honesty. We have been open and frank. We have said what we are able to do in the economic circumstances facing Australia, whereas this Government clearly misrepresented its position year after year to seek some political advantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within that restricted aid vote, we have said that there is a need obviously to concentrate on quality. With less money, it is even more important, although it is important to ensure the best quality aid no matter what the vote is. We have said very briefly that we could best do that by concentrating the program within the Asia-Pacific region&mdash;the region in which we have the most influence, in which we are best able to monitor programs. We would concentrate within this region rather than disperse it anywhere near as widely as this Government has done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The response of the Government to that has been to claim that poverty is elsewhere, which is not in fact true. The largest number of those most in need is still within the Asia region. I say that whilst recognising that, sadly, the position in Africa is continuing to deteriorate and poverty is extensive. It is not true, as this Government has suggested, that the need is no longer in the region. The need is certainly in the region and anybody who has been to Bangladesh would have seen that very quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, we have said that we would want to utilise non-government organisations much more effectively within the program, particularly because of their experience in dealing with poverty and those most in need, and the appropriate structures they have for small-scale programs that can benefit the needy in small scale health programs, education programs and the like. We would very much wish to see the government authorities in this country take into account the experiences and advice of non-government organisations, particularly in country programming in a way that this Government has not been prepared to do in the past. In this glossy document the Minister has produced today, at goodness knows what cost, he does say that in the future the Government will take more account of NGOs. If that is the case, at least the Government has learnt one lesson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also say that we want to give preference for bilateral programs and programs that particularly utilise the best of Australia's goods and services. The trend of this Government has been to increase multilateral aid&mdash;aid to the international financial institutions&mdash;at a cost to bilateral programs. Speaking generally, we say that the most effective Australian aid can be through properly planned country programs on a bilateral basis that are negotiated between our Government and the recipient government that take into account the experiences of NGOs and others who may wish to provide an input that can be most effectively targeted to those in real need. That is the way in which we can enhance Australia's reputation through the program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, we can provide the best of Australia's goods and services and we can get the sort of supplementary advantages that one wants to get out of an effective aid program which are political goodwill, commercial opportunity and so forth. We have said that the most effective way to achieve those supplementary objectives is if the aid program is effective and effectively targeted. So if we concentrate on the quality of aid first, the other benefits will follow. The Government in this document today has said: `Do not concentrate just on the quality of aid; try to identify where you can seek other advantages'. So there are a whole series of objectives, aid objectives, trade objectives, political objectives, but sadly I suggest to the Senate that in my experience the whole program then becomes muddled and we do not even end up with good quality aid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also said that aid under our program will not be applied in ways which support repressive governments and those with excessive military expenditure. Too often we have seen foreign aid in this world allow repressive governments to increase military expenditure at cost to their own people. It is about time the lessons of, say, Ethiopia were learnt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have said that, to avoid wastage, aid decisions will take into account the economic policies of the recipient country because the most effective aid is aid that meshes with sound economic structures of the recipient government; otherwise, too much ends up being wasted. We have said that aid support in forms which are primarily export subsidies will be substantially reduced and ultimately phased out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only area of faster growth in this Government's aid program than the multilateral support, the support to international financial institutions, has been in fact its commercial support direct subsidies to Australian producers, particularly through the DIFF program. It is almost universally accepted&mdash;one only has to read the OECD documents and other assessments to see that&mdash;that mixed credit arrangements, such as our DIFF program, are not good quality aid and do not bring the complementary trade benefits, the flow-on trade benefits, that this Government claims. They are basically a commercial subsidy. If that is so, they should be dealt with elsewhere in the vote and debated in line with all the other examples of government subsidies that we find in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have said that the cost of administration in the provision of aid needs to be substantially reduced. Some $36m on administration is too much for AIDAB. We have suggested in detail in our alternative document ways in which that administration can be cut down so that more of the aid vote can go to those for whom it is designed rather than in maintaining an over-large administration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I might say, in light of the interjection, that this latest glossy is typical of the way in which the aid vote administrative money gets spent in this country. So much of it is spent on promoting the aid program within Australia and the boasts of this Government's achievements within Australia rather than concentrating on the quality of aid and benefiting those most in need.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another stark distinction between the program we have put down and that which the Government has implemented is that, notwithstanding that we will have less money to deal with, we would be able to maintain in real terms our aid for humanitarian and refugee purposes. The contrast of course is that this Government has cut aid in those areas. It has boosted aid to the multilateral banks, it has boosted aid to commercial subsidies in Australia, and it has cut back on aid to emergency situations and refugees. To our side of politics, that simply demonstrates distorted priorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said at the outset, there are so many examples of failed projects which have not achieved the benefit claimed that one could engage in a total debate simply quoting examples. I regret that in this statement the Government does not face up to its areas of failure. That is what one would have thought would have been the starting point&mdash;where the program has failed and how it can be improved for the future. But the Government has not done that because of course it will never admit to error. If one looks, for example, at the Solomon Islands fishing boat fiasco, which left the Solomons $19m in debt through a DIFF program that went wrong, with the provision of unsuitable vessels and so on, one recognises the sorts of deficiencies that I have mentioned. </PARA>

What happened? AIDAB and this Government stepped in and said, `We will give the garbage compactors of Mauritius an updated version of the Mercedes'. The Australian producer, who had good prospects for commercial sales, lost his opportunity and, unbeknown to him, was out-positioned by the taxpayer. There was appalling judgment made in that exercise and the Government should have acknowledged it and said that it would do better in the future. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Mekong bridge project demonstrates again the way in which this Government implements aid. Former Prime Minister Hawke went on a trip to Thailand and said, `Australian taxpayers will provide you with a bridge over the Mekong'. There were no economic viability tests, no examination of social consequences. What was said was, `We will provide you with a bridge'. Of course, the end result of that is that the very important dryland agricultural projects in Thailand are having to be scaled down because we have not got the money to do both. Former Prime Minister Hawke thought that the benefits to the poorest in Thailand would be outweighed by some political advantage that Australia would get through the gift of this bridge&mdash;and he was very much mistaken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The telecommunications project in India is showing signs of a developing fiasco. Mr Acting Deputy President, you might remember that this was one project that had been approved by AIDAB and then we found that it had failed the OECD's tests on mixed credits. AIDAB was embarrassed because it had already agreed to it, but apparently it has found a way of squeezing it through, and it looks as if it is to go ahead. It shows all the signs of a developing fiasco. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the Mozambique development food aid project. Everyone accepts the need for food to go into drought stricken Mozambique. But we provided food aid in a way that was not accounted for. In fact, what was found in the review of that project was that none of the funds had been deposited, as agreed. The aid team could only speculate on what had happened to the funds or the grain. Some, they believe, may have gone on to the `parallel' or otherwise described black market; some may have been absorbed by the agencies selling the grain. But the Australian monitoring mechanisms failed; we did not know what happened to the expenditure of Australian aid money in that regard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;How can one take seriously anyone fulminating against government aid policy who has to concede in the very first sentence of his speech that, if he ever got into government, he would be reducing the aid budget by over $200m over a period of two years? This would have the result of reducing the proportion of ODA that we devote to aid from the present 0.36 per cent to 0.30 per cent. Such cuts would see us slip very rapidly into the bottom third of OECD aid donors. It would see Australia's very hard earned reputation as a humanitarian, generous and effective donor cut to pieces. The cuts demonstrate the breath-taking hypocrisy of everything that the Opposition says in general, and Senator Hill in particular, on this particular subject.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course it is the case that aid is about more than quantity. Aid is about quality as well. But this Government has, despite all the difficulties we experienced in the mid-1980s which did cut the aid budget, done its darnedest to maintain not only the quality of the program, which I will come to in a moment, but its quantity. Despite our difficult economic circumstances, in the last three budgets we have increased ODA by $210m&mdash;8 per cent in real terms. The current aid budget of $1.4 billion gives a ratio, as I have said, of 0.36 per cent to GNP. While that has fallen from the ratio we had in the early 1980s, it does remain above the average of other OECD donors and we are determined to keep it that way. We will achieve, if we possibly can, in the short to medium term at least an increase to 0.4 per cent, and of course we remain committed to the longer term objective of 0.7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aid is, as I have said, about more than that. The virtue of this paper that was put down last night by the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, John Kerin, is that it recognises the complexity of the aid program. It does so in a way that is forward looking and proactive; that provides an up-to-date understanding of what development is all about, what the development debate is all about; it identifies those issues which will dominate the development agenda for the remainder of the century. At the same time it clearly places the aid program alongside of, and as part of, the full range of Australia's interaction and involvement with our region in the developing world generally. It is not a matter of looking at the aid program in isolation; it is a matter of understanding how it interacts with all the other elements of government policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister, John Kerin, made this point with admirable succinctness and clarity in a speech today to the National Press Club when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We now know we need comprehensive national approaches by developed countries involving aid, trade, investment and the public and private sectors. We also know that effective development cooperation involves consultation, cooperation and political sensitivity in designing differentiated programs for recipient countries.</PARA>
<PARA>There is a complexity about all this. Senator Hill's demand for simple verities here as elsewhere simply indicates that he does not understand what aid policy is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the best way of addressing the question of the quality of aid delivery, apart from the issue of mere quantity, is to quickly address a series of specific areas which come up in the Kerin paper and which were referred to in one way or another in what Senator Hill had to say and what the Opposition has had to say in its various pronouncements on this subject. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all, as to quality of administration, the Opposition gets very excited about its description of the aid program as it presently stands as `bureaucratic, cumbersome and inefficient'. It says it would cut wastage. It says that is where most or a significant proportion of its proposed budget cuts would come from. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that Australia's aid delivery is administratively efficient. Less that 3 per cent of the aid budget is devoted to administration. This places AIDAB among the five most administratively lean bilateral donor organisations in the OECD. In the days since the Jackson Committee report we have had created an organisation which is lean and efficient and which has, moreover, built up a very effective culture of evaluation and review. Some $10m, in fact, is annually currently being spent on quality control mechanisms such as reviews, evaluations and audits. Is Senator Hill going to secure Budget cuts there? If so, with what result?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course it is possible to point, in a program of this size, to particular projects that have not been as successful as may have been hoped. Of course it is possible to carp and criticise about this or that. A lot of that carping and criticism has been totally misplaced and there have been answers given in Estimates committee hearings to a number of the specific matters which Senator Hill raised today&mdash;and I do not propose to deal with them again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is that when things do go wrong&mdash;as they are bound to from time to time&mdash;one has to learn from mistakes and ensure that the same kind of thing does not happen again in the future. That is what effective auditing, evaluation, review and control is all about and the Australian aid program is a model of its kind in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me address next the question of the poverty focus of aid because that is something which does go very much to the issue of quality&mdash;what is it that we are seeking to do with our aid program; what kind of objectives are we trying to meet?  The point is, of course, that poverty alleviation cannot be a single objective. While being acknowledged as absolutely intrinsic to any aid program worth its name&mdash;because the humanitarian instinct is the driving force, after all, of any country's aid program&mdash;it nonetheless has to be acknowledged as something which cannot sensibly become the be all and end all of aid policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Government has a three-pronged strategy for tackling poverty. This recognises, first, the fundamental importance of economic growth as well as development activities which bring direct benefits to the poor. The other element refers to direct transfers to the poor&mdash;for example, food, shelter and water&mdash;in times of emergencies and hardship experienced by refugees. So it is a matter of having specific poverty alleviation programs, specific emergency humanitarian programs and longer term infrastructure type developmental programs which contribute to income generation and poverty alleviation in the longer term. To place all one's eggs, as so many of these contributions to the debate do, in a narrowly focused or one-tracked approach to aid delivery is, I think, to miss the point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One area where our aid program will continue to have a particular poverty focus in the future is in Africa, where, as Mr Kerin's paper makes clear, the aid program will concentrate on poverty alleviation in specific areas of Australian expertise: namely health, agriculture and human resource development. What we have by contrast with the Opposition's approach on these matters is just a mess of rhetorical pottage, never actually spelling out what it would do to alleviate poverty, where the particular strategies should run, how they should apply, and where they should be put in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me turn&mdash;and I am conscious of the shortage of time&mdash;to the question of NGOs, which again featured strongly in Senator Hill's rhetorical agenda. Let me make the point that funding through Australian NGOs has increased more than threefold since 1984 from $20m to over $70m. An essential feature of this growth has been an expansion in the range of matters that are subject to AIDAB-NGO cooperation. Previously it was one or two programs. Now NGOs are involved in a very diverse range of AIDAB operations, including not only country programs&mdash;and Senator Hill speaks as though this would be some kind of innovation&mdash;but also, as always, emergency and refugee relief, environmental initiatives and initiatives also to do with subjects like HIV and AIDS. That does reflect the Australian Government's recognition of the special contribution and qualities of NGOs and the contribution, in particular, that NGOs make to quality aid delivery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition merely pays lip service to NGO abilities. It talks, as Senator Hill did today, about utilising their services more effectively, but does not explain what that means in practice. Here, as elsewhere, Senator Hill should be honest and explain how one can possibly cut $209m from the aid program and still somehow increase NGO involvement in the program. Quantity cannot be a substitute for quality; the two go together. I am sure the NGO community will not be in any doubt as to how it reads the policy contrast between the two of us in this respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move to the question of DIFF, the development import finance facility, because that is an area of the aid program which is often the subject of criticism&mdash;certainly by the Opposition&mdash;when it comes to the quality of the aid allocations that we make. Here, again, I can do no better than refer to the kind of things that Mr Kerin was saying in his speech to the Press Club today where he addressed head-on the criticisms that are made so often of the $120m of our aid spending which is devoted to this particular DIFF program, supporting, as it does, the development of government projects in the areas of capital, infrastructure and other priorities&mdash;for example, power generation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that commercial benefits flow from the DIFF program. DIFF operates to offset, in a sense, the disadvantages facing Australian firms when they are competing with aid subsidised finance packages offered by other donor governments. It is true that, up until last year, $300m of DIFF spending did produce commercial benefits of the order of $850m in direct exports by Australian companies and a further $451m in follow-on direct exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is also true that whatever the commercial benefits may be&mdash;and they are very considerable&mdash;they are nonetheless secondary to the scheme's development assistance impact. DIFF is principally about overseas development; its export enhancement function is very much secondary. DIFF projects are subjected to exactly the same scrutiny for developmental soundness as applies to all our aid projects. It is in that context that I think that particular component of aid expenditure should be evaluated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is the question of multilateral funding as compared with country programs. Here, again, I think Senator Hill's contribution was totally misconceived. The situation is that our contribution to the multilateral development banks does now amount to some 12.3 per cent of our current aid program. The reason for that significant proportion of the aid program going in multilateral assistance of this kind is that it does offer a great number of advantages. Within the Asia-Pacific region, the banks' programs very much complement our own. Outside the region, they allow us to provide assistance to countries with which we do not have bilateral programs&mdash;and that is particularly true in Africa and elsewhere. Support for the banks certainly increases our capacity to handle and have an input into global and regional development policy issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is, of course, the case that funds channelled through the banks&mdash;here as elsewhere&mdash;have to be used effectively. We are committed to ensuring that the banks improve their performance. We will be seeking changes in the banks' focus in the 1990s. And some of this, again, is retailed in Mr Kerin's paper: in particular, an increased institutional focus on the South Pacific; increased attention to the social dimensions of development such as poverty alleviation, health and education; increased bank cooperation with UN organisations; and increased attention to particular issues like the development consequences of the HIV AIDS pandemic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A perfectly rational, legitimate aid quality case can be made for providing a measure of our assistance through those institutions. It is only an eighth of the total aid program; it does not dominate the program in the way that Senator Hill was suggesting. It is an important and, I believe, indispensable component of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have here, as I said at the outset, is a balanced, thoughtful, forward looking contribution to the aid debate and identification of the aid agenda by Mr Kerin. What we have by contrast from the Opposition is a blueprint for the aid document that is manifestly empty, out of date in terms of development thinking, out of step with the generosity of the Australian people, incoherent when it comes to a strategic aid policy, lacking in any obvious sense of compassion for the people of the developing world, and lacking any redeeming vision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Senator Hill wants us to do is face the future with our eyes locked firmly on the rear-view mirror, back, in effect, to the pre-Jackson days of the 1980s. Moreover, face the future with $209m less in our pocket over the next couple of years as a result of what must be the most mean spirited, as well as the most hypocritical, contribution to aid policy development by any opposition in living memory. </PARA>

John Kerin. The document seeks to address the situation in the post-Cold War world as it affects the provision of overseas aid. The report contains a lot that is useful, and charts some sort of direction. However, it is also noteworthy that a lot of very important factors are not addressed in this report and are certainly not dealt with in detail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the most important factor is the one which was mentioned briefly both by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Hill) and by the Minister, and that is the level of Australia's overseas aid. The report states that in the last decade alone, Australians, through their Government, have provided over $11 billion to assist the people of the developing world. However, it is on the public record that since the Labor Government came to power in 1983, Australian aid to developing countries has been cut on a continuous basis&mdash;except for the last Budget where we had a slight increase. That increase was welcome, inasmuch as it was an acknowledgment that overseas aid was not the area that ought to be cut all the time, almost automatically, by successive razor gangs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, aid has fallen from 0.51 per cent of gross national product to 0.36 per cent of gross national product. That is just half of the 0.7 per cent target set by the United Nations. I believe it is a shameful record. I believe it is one that must be rectified as a matter of urgency. To underline the urgency I would like to quote very briefly from a book entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">No time to waste</EMPHASIS>. I believe it is aptly entitled. It is by Joan Davidson and Dorothy Myers published by Oxfam. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Latin America, average incomes today are lower than they were in the early 1980s. In sub-Saharan Africa they have fallen to the levels of the mid-1960s. </PARA>
<PARA>The figures quoted here show quite clearly that we are still an affluent country, that people in other parts of the world&mdash;and I only have to mention Somalia&mdash;are starving to death, and that it is our humanitarian duty to do what we can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear that, so far, in the last few years, we have not done what we can. It should also be put on the record that the Opposition would be even meaner. It plans to cut overseas aid by 15 per cent and defence by a mere 2 per cent if it wins the next election. That, surely, is not the right proportion if we are talking about a society that is going through the post-Cold War period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report does not mention a number of other matters which I believe are crucial for the development of effective overseas aid. They are the criteria that are being used by the multilateral development bank and other central financial institutions in granting loans. It is a matter that the Australian Democrats have taken up before and it bears repeating. When loans are granted the main criteria are whether the economic pay-off will be there, and whether repayments will be made over time. We believe that what should be included in the criteria when these loans are granted are not only the economic factors of the projects that are to be financed, but also the social, cultural and environmental implications of the work that is to be carried out. Unfortunately, the report does not address that matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also does not address the links between human rights violations and overseas aid. Clearly, we are not saying, as we would say with defence aid, that aid should be cut when a country is guilty of human rights violations. Nevertheless, there is an inter-relationship between the standard of human rights in recipient countries, the way in which overseas aid is provided and the policy that the Government should pursue in these matters. I believe it is something that needs to be addressed and this document, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Changing aid for a changing world</EMPHASIS>, does not address it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have in this period now, hopefully, reached the stage where strategic and security considerations are a less important factor in the decisions for providing overseas aid. There was a time&mdash;and I refer to an example in the Philippines&mdash;when a road was built to specifications far in excess of what was necessary for local communities. But it proved very handy when the then government wanted to move troops quickly from one end of the country to another in its quest to suppress its own people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would appear that we have moved to the next stage, and economic considerations, particularly the move towards free trade, have become one of those criteria which we pursue in our policy for providing overseas aid. When we look through the matters that are addressed in this report, we find the need for free trade&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was referring to the concept of free trade being used as a criterion for granting overseas aid. It seems to me that that is a contradiction in terms. When we are talking about aid for overseas development, we are talking about targeting, we are talking about assessing needs, and we are talking about directing aid in the most efficient way to get people out of poverty. We believe that we cannot abdicate that sort of strategic approach to the free market which knows no values, and which knows no direction except where the largest demand is and where the capacity to pay is.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The aid charter has been supported by many notable individuals and community organisations and is very worthy of our perusal. As an Australian and a former community development worker in Bangladesh in an international development agency, I take no pride in the present level of development assistance provided by this country. I do not believe that the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of GNP is beyond Australia's means. To argue that it cannot be achieved during difficult economic times begs the question about the continuing decline in this budget item during the 1980s when we were supposedly in such an affluent mode.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aid charter has the potential to set a course for Australian overseas aid for the years ahead. In my moving around the community, more and more people indicate that they are dissatisfied with the way our foreign aid budget is determined and how it is spent. For too long our overseas aid funding has been seen as a soft target for cutbacks when Budgets are drawn up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian people are becoming more and more aware that we have fallen far short of the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of GNP for as long as the target has existed. For too long overseas aid has been regarded as little more than a tool for boosting Australian businesses overseas. There are clear indications of this in Mr Kerin's policy paper, which is regrettable. People are even more critical of the fact that our foreign aid dollars are able to be spent in places with atrocious human rights records and that we as a country are prepared to use foreign aid money to fund projects which are far more to do with military infrastructure than with human development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that, as Senator Hill mentioned earlier, there is far too much emphasis on DIFF in our overseas aid planning, and that is reflected in this document. I am pleased to agree with Senator Hill when he says that DIFF is not good quality aid and that it is a commercial subsidy that should be dealt with elsewhere in our Budget. Aid in the form of loans is not appropriate aid. It is obvious that it only increases the indebtedness of countries that we are purporting to assist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Too much of Australian aid is seen as helping only if it helps us too. Humanitarian aid is not a handout and should not be such, but simply it is our responsibility in relation to social justice and human rights concerns. Overseas aid is about justice. It must not be about handouts and it must not be about double returns&mdash;giving in order to get back in the form of loan repayments. It is when people are provided with the means to achieve their full potential that we are taking steps towards justice. If an Australian has more money and more influence in the world than a person from Bangladesh, that does not mean that the Australian person has more justice or more access to justice. It simply means that the Australian has more money and influence and we have a responsibility that goes with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a double message from Australia and from the Government. That double message is also contained in this document, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Changing aid for a changing world</EMPHASIS>. We do see some pleasing rhetoric relating to green technology, ecological sustainability and women in development. Unfortunately, it does not ride over the fact that we are actually giving far less as a nation than we have in the past. The part I did not include in the incorporated document from the background briefing that Community Aid Abroad provided with its aid charter calls us the selfish nation because the statistics in our 1991-92 Budget Paper show that over the past 20 years our per capita national wealth has increased but our per capita aid contribution has declined. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1968 our GNP per capita was $14,600 and we gave $82 per head in aid. Today, with a per capita GNP of $20,950 we give only $68 per head. This is a double message in a way. It is saying that our Government is selfish in its aid contribution. However, Australians are not selfish. The $10m given by individual Australians to people in Somalia in the last four weeks really points to the need for government policy to shift so that it too reflects the concern that Australian people feel for those around the world who are less fortunate than we are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look forward to studying this policy paper in more detail.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is a great pity that the debate is so limited because this is such an important subject. Apparently Senator Chamarette has been involved in the provision of aid in Bangladesh. I would like to have explored with her some of the matters that I am about to raise. Australia is certainly an affluent country, and we should provide assistance. The question that I want to try to address is in what manner. We all have this warm feeling like motherhood in relation to the provision of aid. We cannot help saying what a tragedy it is that every year there seems to be a cutback and that we should all try to give more aid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two years ago I heard a speech by an Indian social worker who said that she was totally opposed to aid to India. I thought it was a most extraordinary statement. She expanded on it. Unfortunately, I was not able to tape her speech, nor have I been able to obtain a transcript of what she said. My recollection of it is that she said, firstly, that aid enables the politicians of the country that get the aid to get themselves re-elected. That is one great assistance for them. Further, she said that frequently it is very damaging to the people who get the aid in the sense that, for example, if a dam is built in India a large number of people who were living on the land now flooded with water lose their land and have to shift away from that area. I would like to hear what Senator Chamarette has to say about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, Senator Spindler raised the question of roads constructed under aid, mainly for the purpose of shifting troops. I mention to Senator Spindler that the construction of a road in any of our Pacific island countries actually changes the whole face of that country because a road is like a river; people traverse up and down it and live at the side of it and the road becomes a central focus. So the construction of a road in any of the Pacific islands becomes a matter of major importance to the fundamental economics of the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point made by this social worker was that one of the aids that people give is education and that frequently this raises the expectation of the people educated far beyond the ability of the country to use that assistance. The result of that is that the people end up leaving the country. Instead of being educated to assist the country that the aid is being provided to, these people get the individual education and then leave that country to work in some other country where their expectations are able to be fulfilled. That is happening with Australian aid to the Pacific islands because we provide Pacific islanders with university degrees, usually in arts and the other social sciences, mainly because our trade union movement&mdash;I see Senator Foreman and Senator Cook in here; I hope they take notice of this&mdash;refuses to allow these people to get any trade training which may be of assistance to them in their own country. The trade union movement in Australia refuses to have these people come in and get trade training so we give them an education in the social sciences or something of that nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point is&mdash;I think the Indian social worker referred to this, and I can confirm it from my own experience&mdash;that there is a creation of dependency in the nation that receives the aid. It frequently enables the governments to avoid the tough decisions. Although everyone says, `Let's give more aid', frequently the ultimate result of the provision of aid is falling living standards in the country concerned, not raised living standards. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give a couple of practical examples of which I am aware. In one of the Pacific islands that I visited the Australian aid people were asked if they would provide assistance to enable the country concerned to have bitumen roads. The Australian aid fellow quite sensibly said, `No, we will not provide you with aid for bitumen roads because you need to be able to regrade those roads. You have rollers, graders and all the equipment to fix up your roads to their present standard. If you put in bitumen roads, you really will not be able to maintain them'. That country said `Thank you very much' and went away and got the United States to provide bitumen roads and the Australian aid people to provide something else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what is happening in many of our Pacific islands. If they cannot get aid from one government, they get it from another government. There is the creation of a feeling of dependency that goes right through the people. Another problem in the Pacific islands is that there is a concentration of people on small islands so that too many people are living on a particular island for the water supply, the sewage system and the problems with rubbish. That has created enormous difficulties in a number of the Pacific islands that I have visited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point I wish to raise is the use of the aid. In this new program that Mr Kerin has put down in the Parliament today, there is reference to Papua New Guinea and the change to program assistance. I understand that, but one wonders how this program assistance will work. I think the example I am about to give really summarises all of the points I have tried to raise here. Under this program assistance, we intend to give Papua New Guinea $4m to assist with homes for members of its police force. Papua New Guinea has about 8,000 policemen and it has major accommodation problems. Even the regional directors of the Papua New Guinea police force have very poor quality homes. There is a major problem in housing for practically 95 per cent of the 8,000 members of the Papua New Guinea police force. It is a major problem. We are to provide $4m, and I asked a Minister of the former government when I was there how it was intended to spend the $4m. He said, `We are going to build 100 homes'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It costs about $40,000 to buy the land, build a home and put the furniture in. Papua New Guinea has an 8,000 member police force problem and is going to build 100 homes. I said to the Minister, `What about another solution? These people are members of the police force. Many of them will have been employed for many years. Why do you not get a finance company somewhere in the world to provide them with financial assistance to enable them to buy the land and build their own homes, and use the $4m to assist them either with the deposit on the house, lowering the interest rates or somehow in that manner? That way you may end up with 1,000 to 2,000 homes a year. It would provide quite an assistance to the economic problems which Papua New Guinea is facing at the present moment'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That suggestion was rejected out of hand. The fellow said, `No, we need to have 100 homes that we the Papua New Guinea Government own so that we can shift people around in those homes'. We in Australia know that does not work. I explained that it had been tried in Australia with teachers and members of the defence forces and had totally failed, but it was a waste of time. These people are going to take $4m of Australian taxpayers' money and build only 100 homes with it whereas that money could be far better used to provide perhaps 1,000 homes a year or in some way to simply assist the people borrowing the money. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I endorse the paper that has been tabled in the Senate this afternoon entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Changing aid for a changing world</EMPHASIS> and commend Minister Kerin on his address to the National Press Club earlier today. The aid program of the Australian Government seeks to achieve an impact in the area of high quality aid. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, made clear a short while earlier, it does look forward, it does endeavour to influence events and it identifies those issues that serve to dominate the development agenda internationally during the 1990s. The paper is attuned to thinking on development, both domestic and international, and at the same time endeavours to place our aid program within a framework of Australia's interaction and involvement with our region and the developing world in the broader sphere.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will turn to some of the issues later on, but I say at the outset that it is a pity that the debate on our foreign aid program is no longer to be bipartisan. That is a very real pity, because when the debate on the foreign aid program is opened up it will lend itself in some quarters to playing the politics of the lowest common denominator; and, on the threshold of an election, as we move into 1993 that is a temptation I hope everyone in politics avoids. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the coalition talks in Fightback about stripping $209m from the aid budget over a period of two years nowhere is it made clear, as far as I or any commentator, and certainly the aid community in Australia, can determine, just what would be cut, where those cuts would occur, by how much each individual program would be cut, over what period of time&mdash;whether immediately, over 12 months or over two years&mdash;and what in fact the bottom line would be on aid appropriations. Specifics are entirely lacking. The same can be said of the blueprint that Senator Knowles quoted a short time ago. Nowhere is it made clear just where the cuts would fall, apart from some very vague pronouncements on tightening up on administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will say a little bit about AIDAB's performance on that specific matter in a while. No-one should really blame the aid community if there are doubts and suspicions abroad at the moment about coalition intentions and the impact of coalition policies. If there is to be a debate in the run up to the general election, we on this side of the chamber will welcome it. There is no doubting the performance of Australian non-government organisations or the aid community generally. There is no doubting the generosity of Australians: for example, in Somalia in recent times; in Ethiopia in earlier times; and, of immediate consequence, the performance of our NGOs in Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We ought to bear in mind the simple truism that Australian governments of various persuasions have provided over $11 billion in foreign aid during the decade of the 1980s and that Australians contribute between $100m and $120m annually to our aid organisations. That is not simply related to people who are committed voters of the ALP, the Democrats or the Independents; many coalition voters are also generous in their contributions to NGOs. People ought to really bear that in mind when these issues arise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point to the key issues that have been addressed in this paper: the need for greater coordination of international development, particularly under the auspices of the United Nations; economically and ecologically sustainable development to integrate social and cultural factors; the full participation of women in development assistance programs; the importance of human rights in those processes; and the need for even greater cooperation between AIDAB and NGOs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I reinforce the simple fact that, of Australia's aid delivery program, less than 3 per cent of the aid budget is devoted to the administration of AIDAB. That makes AIDAB among the five most administratively lean bilateral donor organisations reviewed under the terms of the OECD. By any criteria or device employed, that is an impressive record. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President. I will try to fit in with the wishes of the Senate. I would have liked to have, as indeed the Leader of the Opposition indicated, a longer time to deal with this question and a greater debate. I have had a chance to look at the document that is before us, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Changing aid for a changing world</EMPHASIS>. There is not much change in it. There is very little new in this document at all. It is a glossy document; but it is just more of the same.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The address to the Press Club today by the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Mr Kerin) is quite revealing. Mr Kerin talks about the matters that are in this document about changing aid for a changing world. He says on page 2 of his speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The policy document describes some areas in which important changes have already been made . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He then enumerates six points which have been on this Government's agenda for some years. So there is nothing much new in this document except for a bold assertion that the Government is committed to increased support for population control, and a restatement, in a different form, of the Government's views on aid and human rights. These two issues are very important in a changing world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clearly the Government's intention more and more to divert much needed aid money to population control. The assumption is twofold: first, that there are too many people in the world; and secondly, that population growth rates are a crucial negative factor in economic development. Those are two assertions. The first statement is totally inaccurate and based on false information; the second statement is blind dogma. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give the House an example of what AIDAB is doing. AIDAB has a population clock above its building. It has also sent one of those population clocks to the National Science and Technology Centre. I went to have a look at that clock after we were told about it in an Estimates committee. I asked the director of the centre about it. He was most interesting when showing it to me and the officer in charge of the section said, `We also have a calculator, which sells for $15, which is very popular with all the thousands of children who come through this building'. I thought that that was most interesting. I said, `Let us have a look at the calculator. Put in "Nigeria" and see how many people live in Nigeria'. So he put in `Nigeria' and out came the population figure for Nigeria&mdash;121 million. I said, `That is interesting. The census figures came out in March of this year. It was the most extensive census that had ever been done in Nigeria, with 800,000 enumerators, and the population came in at 88.5 million'. So the calculator was only 50 per cent out. I had previously asked where they got their figures from. I was told that they got them from UNFPA. UNFPA is 50 per cent out. UNFPA has forecast that by the year 2000, the end of 1999, there will be 150 million people in Nigeria. That is its forecast. One can work it out, as I have done, from the number of women in the fertile age band, et cetera. They will have to get a wriggle on if Nigeria's population is to increase from 88.5 million to 150 million in the next seven years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not go further, but I asked the director and his senior officer to put `Ethiopia' in the calculator, and the calculator came up with a fantastic, impossible figure for Ethiopia. So AIDAB's assumption is based on false figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point about the first assumption is that it rehashes the paranoia about population which was promoted by Paul Ehrlich and others in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. Professor Julian Simon got a bit sick of it by 1980 and suggested to Professor Ehrlich that they have a bet&mdash;`You name any commodities and see whether they will be scarcer in 1990 than in 1980'. Ehrlich nominated the particular commodities&mdash;tin, tungsten, copper and a few others&mdash;and they had a bet. In 1990, each one of those commodities was lower in price in real terms and in actual terms. So those commodities were not scarcer in 1990; they were more plentiful than they were in 1980 because of the ingenuity of human beings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second false assumption is the assertion that population growth rates are crucial negative factors in economic development. Page 57 of the document states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AIDAB will hold a seminar in 1993 to further stimulate discussion in the Australian community about population and development.</PARA>
<PARA>It is a wonder that AIDAB has not had a seminar thus far, because apparently it has come up with its policy and has shut out every other alternative view, including the respectable views of people such as Simon and Kasun. Is AIDAB going to ask international experts such as Simon and Kasun to this conference? It would be interesting to see just how open AIDAB is, whether it has a closed mind, whether it has developed a censorship attitude to this question. Thus far it has done so. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Development Digest</EMPHASIS> of November 1990 reported that AIDAB should:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . educate the Australian public about population issues including the need for population control programs in developing countries.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what its view is. It is blaming, and now the Minister is blaming, the fertility of poor women in poor countries for a range of problems, including famine, poverty and even war. These problems are largely a result of man's inhumanity to man. Indeed, as Senator Austin Lewis has indicated, there is dreadful corruption in various countries. That is one of the problems involved in doing things through multilateral agencies like the UNFPA and the World Bank. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that there should be an emphasis on the bilateral approach to aid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I undertook not to speak for very long, and I will honour that undertaking. I believe that this is a matter which deserves far greater attention by the chamber. We should focus on some of the things that the Minister has mentioned. There is a view, which has fairly substantial support from the facts, that where there is economic development there is a decline in fertility. The Minister indicated this at the end of his Press Club speech by quoting what Indira Gandhi said about development remaining the most effective contraception. Quoting Indira Gandhi, I thought, was a bit rich because although she may have said that, Indira Gandhi implemented a program of brutal and coercive sterilisation affecting millions of Indians. Many Indians still feel resentment about that treatment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I rise to speak briefly on the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Changing aid for a changing world&mdash;key issues for Australia's aid program in the 1990s</EMPHASIS> and the statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) in relation to aid. I wish to bring to the attention of the Senate a problem that I have with one aspect of the aid program. I decided to make these remarks in view of the comments by Senator Loosley on the desirability of a bipartisan program in relation to the aid budget. I wonder whether it would not be possible to reach a bipartisan approach in view of the complaints that a number of NGOs have made and which have come to mind about the amount of money the Government gives to APHEDA, the aid arm of the ACTU. I wonder whether it would be possible to reach a bipartisan position on the very substantial grants that the Government gives to that body.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say that because the Government has recently provided me with some information which I sought in relation to the amount of money which it has given to APHEDA. Madam Acting Deputy President, you will be interested to know that 91 per cent of the budget of APHEDA this year comes from the taxpayer. So far&mdash;and this is not the total figure&mdash;it amounts to about $3.4m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern is that the ACTU clearly has considerable amounts of money available to it. It is going to spend $1m attacking the coalition's Fightback program. Yet it seems to rely on the taxpayer to provide money for the aid budget. It seems to me that the Government has got itself into an extraordinary position. Between $3m and $4m is being provided to the ACTU for this one activity alone, yet the ACTU clearly has a lot of money&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ABORIGINAL COUNCILS AND ASSOCIATIONS AMENDMENT BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the Bill proposes a number of amendments to the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act 1976, hereafter referred to as `the Act', which are designed to improve t he Act so as to:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">i) clarify and strengthen the obligations of Governing Committees of corporations;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ii)protect better the rights of their members; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">iii)streamline and strengthen powers of the Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations to take action against corporations which are in breach of their obligations under the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Hon Ian Viner MP introduced the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Bill to this Parliament on 3 June 1976 he emphasised two features of the new legislation. These were its relative simplicity and flexibility to meet a wide variety of community needs and its capacity to take into account the particular cultural needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and groups.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I can assure honourable senators that both these qualities remain untarnished. So, too, does the Act's capacity to provide groups of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples with an inexpensive and straightforward means of gaining incorporation. While Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and groups can choose to be incorporated under various forms of State and Territory legislation, incorporation under the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act has proved a popular option. There has been a growth in the number of incorporated associations since the commencement of the Act in 1978, reaching approximately 1600 at 30 September 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The requirement that Government funding to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and groups must be by way of grants to incorporated bodies has been a powerful incentive for groups to seek incorporation. The Board of Commissioners of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission has repeatedly made it clear that accountability for the expenditure of funds provided to Aboriginal community organisations through the Commission is not negotiable. The ATSIC Commissioners have done this, for example, by requiring the acquittal by funded organisations of all previous grants before the release of further funds to an organisation. In this, Mr President, the Commissioners are reflecting the views of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people at the community level who recognise that public accountability for expenditure in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs is not only a legitimate concern of Governments, it is also the right and expectation of Aboriginal people who are the clients of funded organisations. However the Act has not provided the Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations with the means to ensure compliance with the obligations of incorporation. The amendments contained in this Bill are designed to assist the Office of the Registrar in the more effective enforcement of compliance with the Act, and in particular to protect the rights of members of associations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody recommended in its historic report that, in the implementation of any policy or program which will particularly affect Aboriginal people, the delivery of the program should as a matter of preference be made by such Aboriginal organisations as are appropriate. [Recommendation 192]. That recommendation of the Royal Commission was supported by all Australian Governments, State, Territory and Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Royal Commission also recognised that Governments were entitled to require a proper system of accounting for funds provided to Aboriginal communities and organisations. The provisions contained in this Bill, Mr President, reflect the desire of the Government for proper standards of accountability in the expenditure of public funds. Equally importantly, however, these provisions also reflect the expectation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people that funded organisations will manage resources made available to them in an effective and efficient manner and in the interests of the communities they serve. That expectation can only be met if associations are required to meet high standards of public accountability in the management of their affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The people who take positions on the Governing Committees of these associations have very serious responsibilities and are doing great service for their communities. Frequently they carry the additional burdens of limited education and management experience. They are deserving of considerable support in these roles, including having clearly stated for them the requirements of incorporation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, there is no acceptable alternative to the establishment of honesty and clear and open accountability as the guiding principles for the conduct of the affairs of these incorporated associations. To accept anything less is to deny Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the communities a chance for a better life. We must not risk undermining the whole strategy of Aboriginal self management through the erosion of public confidence in it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the Act is an important tool in the Government's hand for ensuring accountability and transparency in the operations of incorporated bodies. Unfortunately many of its compliance and accountability provisions have proved to be blunt and unwieldy in their application. The central purpose of the amendments contained in this Bill is to correct these deficiencies in the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will strengthen the obligations of the Governing Committees and the corresponding rights of the members of incorporated associations in the following ways:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 10 will make the rules of an association have the effect of a contract between the association, its members, the members of the Governing Committee and the Public Officer;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 11 will provide for the disqualification from being on Governing Committees of people with convictions for offences involving fraud or misappropriation of funds, the requirement for Committee Members to disclose pecuniary interests, to act honestly and diligently and the requirement for Committee Members to vacate office in the event of becoming bankrupt;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 13 will require Governing Committees to call and conduct annual general meetings and special general meetings as provided in the association's rules; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 14 will require that the Committee's and Examiner's reports, which the Governing Committee is required to produce, will be made available at Annual General Meetings and for inspection by members of associations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another set of amendments are aimed at ensuring that Governing Committees do not run the affairs of associations without due regard for the wishes of the members, and avoiding fragmentation of community groups.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 9 will enable the Registrar to refuse to issue a certificate of incorporation to an Association if the rules do not give members an effective degree of control over the running of the association;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 9 will provide that Associations which are not formed wholly for business purposes, or to hold title to land or a leasehold interest, will be required to have at least 25 members; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 12 will require that Governing Committees provide the Registrar with updated lists of membership of associations. This should clarify situations when the Registrar is obliged to act as an arbitrator in disputes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, each of these amendments will either confer new rights or clarify and strengthen existing rights of members of associations and ensure that Governing Committees conduct the affairs of associations honestly, openly and in the interests of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and the communities in which they operate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will streamline and strengthen the powers of the Registrar to take action against corporations which are in breach of their obligations under the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A major deficiency in the Act is the limitation on the Registrar regarding the power to act as an arbitrator in disputes. Clause 13 will provide the Registrar with specific powers to act in the role of an arbitrator of disputes and includes the ability to require Governing Committees to call and conduct annual general meetings and special general meetings. This should be a means by which matters can be resolved before they develop into damaging and time consuming disruptions to the affairs of associations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 16 will provide procedures by which the Registrar may investigate the affairs of an association. These are now considerably streamlined. Instead of having to engage registered company auditors for all investigations, the Registrar can appoint an authorised person to examine the documents of an association. The person may well be a qualified auditor in some situations, but in many situations, such qualifications would not be required. This can provide both a saving in costs and a greater ability to act quickly and with flexibility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 17 will give the Registrar power to apply for injunctions where the Registrar considers that an association is not complying with a provision of the Act, the regulations or the association's rules. This procedure replaces a more complicated procedure involving the issue of several notices on the association, prior to any legal action being taken regarding its non compliance with the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provisions of the Act under which the Registrar can apply to the Court to appoint a Judicial Manager are replaced by Clause 23, which will give the Registrar powers to appoint an Administrator. This again will give the Registrar more flexibility and the ability to act more quickly when there are requirements that the affairs of an association be placed under special management.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the amendments contained in this Bill will make it easier to achieve better accountability without placing onerous burdens on the Governing Committees of incorporated associations. All of the associations incorporated under the Act will be informed of the amendments once they become law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate, and I present the Explanatory Memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">HOUSING ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Housing Assistance Amendment Bill 1992 amends the Housing Assistance Act 1989 to extend the period of guaranteed funding under the 1989 Commonwealth State Housing Agreement (CSHA) by three years to 1995-96. The moneys appropriated include funding for a doubling of the provision of community housing through the introduction of a new Community Housing Program within the CSHA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also provides for the bringing forward of out-year CSHA funding for employment creation in areas of housing need and high unemployment, and as part of improved cash management arrangements being introduced under the CSHA in 1992-93, the Bill allows for funds that have been allocated to a State in respect of a grant year, but not fully paid out in that year, to be carried over between grant years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The housing reform initiatives announced by the Government in its 1992-93 Budget Statement "Housing&mdash;Choices for a Changing Nation" are necessitated by major changes in the structure of the population, the need to ensure that all Australians have access to secure, adequate, appropriate and affordable housing, the need for micro-economic reforms to increase the efficiency, flexibility and productivity of the housing industry, and the increasing urgency of environmental issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Budget measures build on the policy outcomes of the National Housing Strategy and include initiatives to keep home ownership affordable, to bridge the gap between renting and home ownership through shared home ownership, to increase the supply of low cost housing, to increase choice in management style, location and housing type, to provide more adequate and better targeted rent assistance, and to improve planning and development of our communities so as to safeguard the environment and ensure services are close to where people live.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The programs provided through the CSHA are a vital element of the integrated package put forward in the Budget, which maintains an important balance between supply and demand side measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Public and community housing provides security of tenure, reduces the incidence of discrimination, and ensures the availability of affordable housing stock to address the range of needs which may not be adequately addressed in the private market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since coming to office in 1983, the Labor Government has provided total Commonwealth funding of almost $7-1 billion under the CSHA to the end of 1991-92. An additional $2.4 billion was provided through Nominated Loan Council arrangements which applied up to the end of 1988-89.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The stock of public housing has risen to around 370,000 at 30 June 1992, an increase of more than 51 per cent since this Government came to office. The number of home purchase assistance loans increased by 141 percent, with the total value of loans now at more than $2,400 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This stands in contrast to the Opposition's policies which would see housing assistance provided in the form of means tested rental subsidies, public housing dismantled and the stock of houses which has been built up as a result of the community's investment over many years sold off.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The narrowness of this approach is evident overseas, where it can be seen that reliance on rental subsidies or allowances has resulted in a growth in homelessness in the United Kingdom and the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is telling that the Opposition has adopted its very narrow approach at a time when there is increasing pressure for it to be abandoned overseas, and for there to be a return to a balance between supply and demand side measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the allocation over the next four years a total of $4186.37 million under the CSHA, the Government has confirmed its commitment to continued expansion of the supply of low cost housing under the CSHA, and to provision of greater diversity in public and community housing to meet the changing needs of the population.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This total includes additional funding of $123 million which will more than double the Government's existing commitment to the provision of community housing, and will bring the total stock of public and community housing to over 400,000 units Australia-wide.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In negotiating the proposed funding package with the States and Territories, the Government has sought specific reforms to planning and cash management arrangements to ensure that State Housing Authorities are more accountable and that their services are more responsive to the changing needs of the communities they serve.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will involve improvements to consultation, planning, and reporting arrangements under the CSHA, including introduction of three year rolling plans and the development of outcome based performance measures which will ensure greater accountability against agreed national objectives and related targets. These improvements will provide a basis for evaluation of the Agreement in 1995, and for the development of national housing policy. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The national objectives and priorities proposed by the Commonwealth are consistent with the existing principles in Recital (d) of the CSHA, but are an attempt to clarify the outcomes sought, and to make more explicit the relationship between housing and broader urban planning and provision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under new cash management arrangements being introduced in 1992-93 future Commonwealth grants will generally not be paid more than one month in advance of need as demonstrated by expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill enables any Commonwealth grants allocated to a State in a particular grant year, but not paid in that year for cash management reasons, to be carried over to the following year at the discretion of the Commonwealth Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These improved cash management arrangements will eliminate a consistent pattern of underspend by the States and Territories, from which an estimated saving of $50 million has been identified this financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has also obtained agreement from State and Territory Housing Ministers to establish the Community Housing Program as a new tied program under the Agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new Community Housing Program is part of a supply initiative to enhance choice, appropriateness and flexibility of housing for people on low incomes. Its introduction will enhance the access of disadvantaged people on low incomes to affordable, responsive and accountable housing models which provide security of tenure and increased control and participation by tenants and the wider community. It will also facilitate the provision of housing which is better linked to services for those with special needs, including the aged and people with disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Community Housing Program will incorporate the current Local Government and Community Housing Program (LGACHP) and will provide funding to Local Government and non-government agencies for the development and support of community housing in Australia. The aim would be to double the size of the community housing sector to 25,000 by the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A proportion of the funds allocated to the Community Housing Program will be earmarked for national priorities in consultation with the States and funding will be paid through the States.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The variations being made to the CSHA will be formally tabled in the Parliament in the near future as soon as the necessary formal processes with the States and Territories are complete.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill introduces flexibility to the existing arrangements for the allocation of untied CSHA funds between States and Territories, to allow the amounts of $75 million in 1992-93 and $25 million in 1993-94 to be allocated to projects put forward by States and Territories to bring forward housing activity in areas of housing need and high unemployment, rather than on a per capita basis. These amounts are offset by reductions of $50 million in the level of untied grants to be provided in 1994-95 and 1995-96.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Each State and Territory will, however, receive a per capita allocation of all untied funds over the period 1992-93 to 1995-96.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill ensures that States and Territories are not disadvantaged under matching arrangements when Commonwealth untied grants are moved between years through the bring forward for employment creation or the operation of the new payment arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that the arrangements introduced in this Bill and the implementation of agreed reforms to the CSHA will place the Commonwealth and the States in a stronger position to address housing needs of the many different types of households in the 1990s and beyond, will provide a better basis for the development of stronger national housing policies, will improve accountability, and above all provide greater assurance that housing needs are being met more efficiently and with greater equity in a financially secure, long-term climate of commitment and purpose.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I take great pleasure in introducing to the Senate the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Bill 1992. This Bill will establish the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Honourable Senators may be aware that since 1967, the inter-governmental arrangements for the clearance and registration of agricultural and veterinary chemicals have evolved. This led, in July 1991, to the Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments agreeing  to replace the existing eight State and Territory registration bodies with a single national scheme to register agricultural and veterinary chemicals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the decision in July 1991, there has been considerable progress in implementing the Scheme. Indeed, from 1 July 1992, under an agreement between the Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments, the Commonwealth has taken over from the States and Territories all the evaluation of agricultural and veterinary chemicals with the States and Northern Territory only undertaking the administrative action of issuing the registration certificates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The establishment of the National Registration Authority is the next step in the development of the National Registration Scheme for agricultural and veterinary chemicals and a clear indication of the Government's commitment to an on-going program of micro-economic reform of these regulatory arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill establishes an institutional framework for the National Registration Authority. The main features of the Bill are to establish the Authority as a statutory authority and to make provision for a Board which will be more widely-based than the Australian Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill provides for the Authority to replace the current Council which, since its establishment in 1988, has established procedures which are widely recognised as  professional, impartial and comprehensive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By establishing it as a statutory authority, the Government is providing the Authority with a framework to handle the registration activities in a more flexible, accountable and business-like manner while still maintaining the credibility of the registration process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would emphasise that this Bill does not in itself change the arrangements for the registration of agricultural and veterinary chemicals. Legislation for the new operational procedures for the national registration of agricultural and veterinary chemicals will be introduced as separate legislation in the Autumn Sittings next year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Establishing the Authority before the main legislation relating to the National Registration Scheme will allow the Board of the Authority to contribute to the development of the legislation it will administer. An extended period of consultation with all stakeholders on the registration arrangements is planned.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now turn to the provisions of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In regard to its powers and functions, the Authority will take over those of the current Australian Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Council as amended by the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Amendment Bill 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister will have the power to direct the Authority in exceptional circumstances, but it will be a requirement that such direction be presented to both Houses of Parliament and reported in the Authority's annual report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 3 of the Bill provides for the Authority to have eight Directors. All will be part-time and will be chosen to bring the necessary range of expertise to the Authority. Directors will be appointed by the Minister for a term not exceeding three years but will be eligible for re-appointment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Board membership will be drawn from the major stakeholders involved in the regulation of agricultural and veterinary chemicals including State Governments, the agvet chemical industry, the rural sector, the trade union movement and consumer organisations. This reflects the views expressed during the comprehensive consultation process which has preceded development of this Bill that decisions on agricultural and veterinary chemicals should be made by the people affected by them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 3 also establishes the basic meeting procedures for the Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Authority may also appoint committees to assist it in discharging its duties. These committees will have such membership as the Authority considers appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Chief Executive Officer will be appointed by the Board to manage the operations of the Authority according to the policies and directions of the Board.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the next four years, the Authority will move to fully recovering its costs from the agvet chemical industry. To provide the Board with the maximum flexibility to allow it to operate in a business-like manner and to respond to changing demands, the Bill will give the Authority the power to set the terms and conditions of employment of its staff. Staff may also be employed by arrangements with the Commonwealth, State or Territory administrations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As well as normal provision for an annual report to Parliament, the Authority will be required to submit both a longer term corporate plan and an annual operational plan to the Minister. The Minister may approve or seek a variation to these documents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As provision was made in the 1992-93 budget for a statutory authority for the registration of agricultural and veterinary chemicals to be established on 1 January 1993 and for payments to the States and Northern Territory for a compliance program, this Bill will have no impact on Government expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The establishment of the National Registration Authority is the next step in the Commonwealth's on-going program of micro-economic reform of this important regulatory function. Together with the national registration legislation foreshadowed for the Autumn Sittings next year the establishment of the National Registration Authority will result in a process which is more accountable, transparent, open and efficient.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to Honourable Senators and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AGRICULTURAL AND VETERINARY CHEMICALS AMENDMENT BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I take great pleasure in introducing to the Senate the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Amendment Bill 1992. The purpose of this Bill is to introduce amendments to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act 1988 which are necessitated by the introduction of the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Bill 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act 1988 established the Australian Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Council (AAVCC) together with that Council's powers and functions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a next step in implementing a national registration scheme for agricultural and veterinary chemicals, the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals will be established to take over the powers and functions of the AAVCC. In amending the existing legislation, provision has been made also for the Board to encourage the development of uniform national procedures for control-of-use activities and to co-ordinate a program of compliance ie ensuring the products on sale are registered and consistent with the conditions of registration. Both of these initiatives have been agreed to by the Minister's State and Territory colleagues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Also, the Bill widens the scope of advice which the Authority may provide on its own initiative or at the Minister's request. This will allow the expertise of the Board and the Authority to be brought to bear on the major issues facing the agvet chemical industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principal amendments of this Bill are therefore to replace the AAVCC with the National Registration Authority. Continuity of operations and policy is assured  by declaration that applications, decisions and any other act or things done in relation to the Council are deemed to have been performed in relation to the National Registration Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As provision was made in the Budget for the establishment of the NRA on 1 January 1993 and for Commonwealth funding of a compliance program up to point of retail sale, the Bill will not have any significant impact on Government expenditure or revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments of this Bill are part of an on-going program of reform of the regulation of agricultural and veterinary chemicals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to Honourable Senators and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1992 contains the amendments to the Child Support Scheme announced in the Budget, a number of other changes being made to correct some drafting errors, and a number of other improvements in the operational effectiveness of some areas of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As announced in the Budget, the child support formula is to be changed in cases where one parent has substantial access to a child or children who are included in the assessment. A new set of formula percentages are to be inserted in the "Modified Table of Child Support Percentages" to take account of the change.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present an allowance is available in the formula only if one parent has a child for at least 40% of the nights in the child support year in which case the parents are deemed to be sharing the child equally. A modified formula applies in these cases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The revised formula will recognise a level of shared care to be known as "substantial access". This level will arise where a parent has the care of a child for at least 30% and less than 40% of the nights in a child support year. In the example where there is only one child in a family and substantial access is established, the parent with substantial access will be able to make a claim for child support against the other parent who has the major access on the basis they have 35% of the care of the child. The major access person will only be able to claim on the basis of 65% of the care. New formula percentages of 8% and 14% rather than nil and 18% will apply.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the event that the major access person has income below the disregard amount and therefore has no liability to the other parent, the lower child support percentage will still apply in the assessment and provide some relief to the substantial access parent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This measure will apply to all child support assessments raised on and after 1 July 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two other changes announced in the Budget which will have effect from 1 January 1993 that are included in this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first is to modify the penalty provisions for unpaid child support to remove the up front flat rate penalty and to leave the ongoing per annum rate as the only penalty. This is being done to simplify processing of penalty cases and to enable clients to be kept informed regularly of the penalty balance on their account. The other is to extend to new recipients of additional family payment from 1 January 1993 who receive maintenance under a court order or court registered agreement the same one time option to receive their child support privately and directly without being required to have the liability registered and collected by the Child Support Agency. This option was first made available to DSS recipients under Stage II of the Scheme from 1 July this year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A penalty for understating taxable income, in cases where an estimate of current year income is used, is to be introduced for child support assessments that have effect on and after 1 July 1993. The penalty will first arise in the 1994-95 child support year after a comparison is made between the estimate of taxable income provided in 1993-94 and the actual taxable income returned for that year. The Registrar will allow a tolerance of 10% to be applied to the difference between the estimate and the actual taxable income before the penalty is imposed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are also several amendments in this Bill which correct and clarify certain provisions relating to the administrative review of child support assessments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other changes being introduced are mainly of a machinery nature. One is to widen the grounds for departure from an administrative assessment and another is to give the Registrar greater flexibility in the determination of a taxable income amount to be used in formula assessment cases when one is not readily available from taxation records. Another is to reduce the minimum life of an income estimate from 3 months to 2 to allow more flexibility and to allow regulations to be prescribed which outline the effect of income estimates on child support assessments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the Explanatory Memorandum which contains a more detailed explanation of the provisions of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill amends the Superannuation Act 1922, the Superannuation Act 1976, the Superannuation Act 1990 and the Superannuation (Productivity Benefit) Act 1988.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These Acts relate to the provision of superannuation benefits to civilian Commonwealth sector employees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill covers a wide range of topics. The purposes of the amendments include compliance with the Superannuation Guarantee requirements, ongoing compliance with the Occupational Superannuation Standards, streamlining of the administration of some of the Commonwealth's superannuation schemes and clarification of areas of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A major part of the Bill involves amendments to the Superannuation Act 1976 to comply with the superannuation guarantee requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Parliament approved legislation for the Superannuation Guarantee earlier this year. To comply with the superannuation guarantee requirements, this Bill includes amendments to the 1976 Act scheme to ensure that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the minimum amount of employer benefit required under the Superannuation Guarantee is vested in each employee each year from 1 July 1992 and provide an additional benefit in two situations to meet that requirement; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">an amount representing that minimum amount to be preserved until genuine retirement from the work force on or after age 55 or earlier death or invalidity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Generally speaking, the benefits under the 1976 Act scheme would more than meet the minimum employer benefit required by the superannuation guarantee legislation. Therefore, it is likely that the additional top-up benefit need be paid only in two circumstances, namely, death in service without dependants and resignation without preservation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also includes specific amendments to the 1976 Act scheme to continue the ongoing process of compliance with the Occupational Superannuation Standards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many of the Occupational Superannuation Standards are provided for in regulations under the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987. I draw Honourable Senators' attention to the fact that the Bill provides that regulations may be made under the 1976 Act to satisfy conditions or requirements of the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987 and regulations under that Act. This provision is essential to enable changes to be made to the 1976 Act scheme to keep up with changes in the Standards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments also make provision for recognition of multiple memberships of the Commonwealth's superannuation schemes where a person holds more than one job.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The era when a single full-time job was the recognised pattern of employment has passed. Persons can hold a full-time job plus a part-time or casual job or more than one part-time or casual job.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provisions in the superannuation schemes do not necessarily cater for such multiple jobs in a satisfactory way. For example, a permanent part-time employee who is a member of the 1976 Act scheme cannot receive benefits in respect of a casual job that he or she might hold.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rules of the scheme established under the Superannuation Act 1990 can cater for some cases of multiple employment. However, the variety of employment patterns that is emerging means that the rules need to be examined to see whether they are equitable in all circumstances. The proposed amendments to the 1990 Act in this area will take effect from a future date to enable appropriate revision of the rules to be made where necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments in the Bill will provide for multiple memberships within the one scheme or membership of more than one scheme in appropriate circumstances. Given the variety of multiple employment patterns that now exist, flexibility to cater for situations where a person's benefits should, in fairness, be treated as one membership also is to be provided.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most of the remaining amendments in the Bill are technical in nature.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some amendments are desirable to provide for consistency of administration. For example, amendments to the 1990 Act will provide that benefits under that Act will be paid from Consolidated Revenue directly to the member as happens with the 1976 Act scheme and the Defence Force schemes, rather than have the payments going from Consolidated Revenue to the Fund and then to the member.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other amendments clarify the legislation and remove unintended effects. For example, amendments to the 1976 Act scheme in the Bill clarify the intention that persons leaving the 1976 Act scheme because of the sale of a Commonwealth asset or the transfer of a Commonwealth function and who either continue to be employed or reject an offer of equivalent employment, do not have access to retrenchment benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some of the amendments operate retrospectively. These would either benefit members, correct unintended effects of the current legislation, or are technical amendments required by changes to other legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now turn to the financial impact of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most of the proposed changes do not have any financial impact because they are technical amendments or clarifications of existing provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where provisions could have a potential financial impact, the impact is likely to be small.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, the two circumstances mentioned earlier where an additional benefit is needed under the Superannuation guarantee are uncommon. Moreover, the amount of any additional benefit would be small because members would already be entitled to the 3 per cent productivity benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In summary, the potential financial impact of the changes in the Bill would be contingent on the happening of future events which cannot be predicted with any certainty. Therefore the financial impact cannot be quantified.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">NATIONAL RESIDUE SURVEY ADMINISTRATION BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the Bill and its complementary Levy Bills is to establish administrative arrangements and more effective and equitable cost recovery for the National Residue Survey.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Residue Survey (NRS) has a unique role in Australian food production and trade, scientifically monitoring and compiling information on chemical residues in Australian produce. Samples of Australian-produced animal and plant food products are analysed each year for residues of a wide range of contaminants, with meat being the main product monitored. Specific studies on residues in food commodities are also undertaken as the need arises.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NRS is planned and managed by the Bureau of Resource Sciences within the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, with most of the testing being carried out  by the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories on a fee-for-service basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other similar surveys conducted by State and Commonwealth authorities complement the NRS but, because of their differing scopes and more specific purposes, do not necessarily fulfil the  important national role that NRS provides.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consumers worldwide are becoming increasingly concerned about the chemical residue status of  the food they eat. While recognising that agricultural and veterinary chemicals are needed to produce food efficiently, consumers expect assurances that chemical residues in agricultural products do not pose a health risk.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NRS results are accepted widely in Australia and overseas as scientifically authoritative. They indicate that the residue status of the food commodities exported from Australia is first class. Residue monitoring is an important part of any strategy to minimise unwanted chemicals in food and underpins Australia's position as a clean food producer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NRS reliably assures consumers and trading partners on the residue status of Australian produce valued at many thousands of millions of dollars each year. Australian  meat exports to several countries, including the USA and the European Community, are conditional on the continued availability of NRS results and testing programs to their Government authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The survey was funded wholly by the Commonwealth until 1987 when the scale of the testing was increased substantially and 60 per cent cost recovery then became applicable. The recovery was effected by way of fees and charges under the export inspection arrangements. The recovery arrangements have either already changed or will change in future. In the interests of sustaining a stable program which meets obligations, it is no longer appropriate to continue using those fees and charges.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Separately, the Government has decided that, as producer industries are the main beneficiaries of the survey,  cost recovery should apply to the fullest extent possible from 1 July 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NRS Administration Bill provides for a trust account to be established, which will enable funds and obligations to be carried over beyond the end of the financial year. Payments into the account will mainly be receipts of the levies imposed under the complementary Levy Bills. Provision is also made for other contributions to be received from industries, which allows them flexibility in the means of raising the funds other than by way of levy collections. Where desirable, other industry contribution arrangements can be implemented for a particular product, thus obviating the need for collection of any levy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The inclusion of a product within the survey is dependent on funding being available, either by levy or other means. For those products which are required or requested to be included in the survey the levy imposition Acts allow collection of money to be made in an equitable and simple manner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Authoritative reporting on a range of commodities enhances the status of the survey internationally. However, unless there are compelling reasons to the contrary, no product will be proposed for inclusion in the survey unless the Minister is satisfied that its inclusion accords with the wishes of the relevant industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is recognised that under full cost recovery, some industries which were previously included in the survey may wish to be excluded or to adjust the size and scope of their commodity program. Conversely, those industries wishing to have their products included in the survey but previously lacking a means to fund their inclusion, will in future be given the means to do so. To encourage full participation, the levy arrangements will take into account the different needs and interests of the commodity industries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under full cost recovery, few payments into the account from Parliamentary appropriations under clause 7 (e) are expected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Turning to payments out of the account, there will be a significant change from current procedures in the  administration of the survey. Under clause 8 (a), payments may only occur when the survey program for the year has been approved by the Minister. For the first time, the Minister will be involved formally in approving the program. This additional level of planning will result in improvements in the breadth, scope and operation of the survey.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The administrative planning will be assisted by a small non-statutory committee comprising persons with knowledge of chemical contaminants and the needs of the producing industries. The committee's charter will allow for NRS management to be accountable to industries without compromising the independence, authority and credibility of the NRS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The survey management will be accountable to the Parliament through the Minister by way of the tabling of an annual report on income and expenditure, which will include a description of the survey activities undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ability to carry over the account balance  will provide the survey management with the flexibility to reduce problems of over- or under-recovery. This will enable the programs to proceed smoothly in the face of fluctuations of levy receipts, both within and between seasons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Provision for ongoing program costs will need to be taken into account in annually reviewing and setting the operative levy rates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Increasing the level of cost recovery for the NRS from 60 per cent to 100 per cent, together with increased administrative efficiency, is expected to result in a saving to the Commonwealth of approximately $2.7 million per annum on current costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Levies for the recovery of survey costs will be imposed under the individual Levy Bills that are complementary to the NRS Administration Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As far as practicable, the imposition of the NRS levies is to be in the same form and at the same stage of the production and marketing process as other, more substantial, levies collected under the existing provisions of the Primary Industry Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991. These procedures will simplify the payment, collection and administration of the levies and reduce costs. Additionally, an opportunity is provided for direct contributions to be made by industries, subject to satisfactory arrangements being agreed upon. This alternative will be of particular value to industries whose products have no levies in existence as yet and need to be included in the NRS to help develop or preserve valuable markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Schedule to this Bill specifies the maximum rates of levy that can be imposed on all products shown and operative rates to be in effect at the commencement of the Act.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">NATIONAL RESIDUE SURVEY (CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the Bill is to make consequential amendments to current legislation to ensure that the National Residue Survey levy imposed under that legislation ceases on 1 July 1993 when the National Residue Survey legislation will come into effect. The Bill will also allow the collection of levies in respect of aquatic animals, game meat and the slaughter of horses. The Bill complements the National Residue Survey Administration Bill.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Chairman. I appreciate that. I had indicated to Senator Button that I would be doing this. The Minister might recall that I first raised with him the possibility of North Queensland representation on the Multifunction Polis Development Corporation Board. I did that in the Senate on 14 November 1991. The Minister expressed awareness of the enthusiasm of the Future North Queensland Syndicate to play a role in the MFP project. That syndicate represents the whole length of North Queensland. It was formed to put forward a proposal for an MFP project in the north in the early days. It was not the project that received the favourable nod from the Queensland Government; the Queensland Government put up some other project in the south-east of the State, which went forward. It was not chosen as the national site.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I share the query of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) as to whether the board was intended to be State representative or whether there were to be additions. It was not quite clear from the earlier discussions we had.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Minister's letter of 2 March his advice to me on how best to assist in gaining North Queensland representation was to write to indicate the interests of the Future North Queensland Syndicate in representation on the MFP board to the Queensland Government. The Minister also suggested that the syndicate should indicate its interest to the South Australian Government. I passed on this advice to the Future North Queensland Syndicate and I believe it subsequently wrote to the South Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The implication clearly was that Queensland would play a role in the nomination of the board members from Queensland. In view of what the Minister said, that may be qualified somewhat. Whether this nomination was to be one of the initial 12 or as a State government representative was unclear from the Minister's letter. On the Minister's advice I wrote to Mr Goss on 28 May formally suggesting that Professor Hosking of the Future North Queensland Syndicate be considered for nomination to the MFP board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Hosking is a very well qualified academic who is involved in a lot of private enterprise deals and in this North Queensland Syndicate which has a mix of private enterprise people, local councillors and people from academic circles who are all very well qualified and very well known in the north. I sent copies of that letter to the then South Australian Premier, Mr Bannon, and the then Industry Minister and current Premier, Mr Arnold. I also sent Senator Button a copy of that letter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Goss wrote to me on 8 July saying that representation of State governments other than the South Australian Government was yet to be settled. The other positions on the board, that is, the up to 12 to be chosen in consultation with Senator Button, were to be filled on the basis of the interests and expertise which the members bring to them. I might say that that more or less repeats what the Minister has indicated previously. In addition, Mr Goss also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In view of the continuing interest of the Future North Queensland Syndicate in establishing complementary linkages with a range of proposed MFP activities, I would not be opposed to the syndicate being nominated on this latter basis provided that relevant local business and other interests in the MFP projects are adequately catered for. I have forwarded a copy of this letter to Senator Button.</PARA>
<PARA>It appears that everyone was aware of the interest of the Future North Queensland Syndicate. This Minister, the South Australian Government and the Queensland Government were aware of its interest.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the Minister to indicate to me whether Professor Hosking was considered and if he was not, why he was not considered, given that there was a good case for his candidature.

It has a program and a plan which I think could well fit in with the Adelaide base of the MFP and could make the whole MFP project a truly national project. The North Queensland particular interest is one that would be very complementary to the Adelaide one and would cater for specific areas that would not be appropriately built or based in Adelaide. I am hopeful that certainly the Future North Queensland Syndicate can become involved. If not that syndicate, then some other syndicate. Certainly there is a real opportunity for a nationwide project and I am sure these people could very well contribute to this overall national goal. </PARA>

For example, the Manufacturing Council at present is conducting a study on the export performance of small firms, and last week Mr Mountford advised me about the work that is being done in that study and some of the conclusions. That advice, which was for information purposes essentially, may have contained a mixture of philosophy, and it certainly did not contain any policy advice. So that is how it all works. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister may think this is a matter of no consequence. He says that, because he does not use the position improperly, everything is okay. The Western Australia Inc. Royal Commission report had this to say about propriety between the Executive and the bureaucracy:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Public Service lost, if not its way, then some of its role and character in the political and governmental environment into which we have inquired. Denied an effective advisory role . . . it was reduced to impotence in circumstances where ministerial advisers, favoured appointees to the Public Service and others captured the advisory role which traditionally has been seen as a raison d'etre of an experienced Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA>It also went on to say that the reason this occurred was that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Parliament, the public's representative forum, has failed to provide an effective check on the executive arm of government. The Parliament, no less than the public, was kept ignorant of many of the matters which led to the establishment of the Commission and which have had such adverse consequences for every person in the State. It must bear . . . direct responsibility for this state of affairs.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a perfectly accurate and fair commentary on the way our system works. If the Parliament is not vigilant and does not ensure that things are done correctly, the consequences can be those that we have seen in Western Australia. </PARA>

Will the Minister go away and find me a copy of the contract that he enters into? Can he provide for me the information of what this particular contract is standard for? He calls it standard but he does not say what it is standard for. Would the Minister please go away and consider the way in which he can make Mr Mountford a regular employee subject to the relevant Public Service Act, the relevant audit Act and so on so that we are no longer in breach of the Government's own policy guidelines for the hiring of consultants?</PARA>

Mr Mountford has been to every Estimates committee that Senator Bishop and I have been to. There are no Estimates committees in Western Australia. Historically, other committees do not provide the scrutiny which our system does, with the full support of this Government. To turn Mr Mountford into a sort of silk purse for the purpose of making this point is a little far-fetched. I resent the reference to favoured employees.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When Mr Mountford appeared before Estimates committees we found out that he has a staff of 26 people and that, basically, the staff does nothing much more than, it seems, provide tea and bickies and hand out reports done by other consultants. If we go through previous annual reports, the Minister will see again and again that a legion of consultants is employed both to do the work and, equally, to publicise it. There are large contracts. In all that time, Mr Mountford never told us that he too was a consultant.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The hearing on program 4 dealing with national standards was interesting because, for the first time, we really focused on the important impact that regulation in this area can have on the economy as a whole. Subsequent to those hearings we had the legislation brought forward by the Government to put in place quite rigorous standards which, from the Opposition's point of view, we argued would be putting an undue burden on the weighing industry and that, in turn, would impact upon the economy generally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was one particular area where the National Standards Commission was to be given the power to hold the weighing instruments seized for as long as it may have chosen. We thought that this random activity and the intrusive nature of it was quite unjustified, and the questioning in Estimates committee hearings reflected that view. When we came to dealing with the Bill the Opposition opposed those provisions, along with other provisions. On that particular provision, the Australian Democrats joined with us and the power to enter, seize and take custody of weighing instruments was denied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought that might have been an end to it but, no, the National Standards Commission, the authority involved, under the signature of Dr G.

It purports to be quite naive&mdash;or, shall we say, quite neutral&mdash;in the questions he was asking.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">19 October 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subject: Pattern Compliance</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To: All submitters for pattern approval</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As you would be aware, the National Measurement Act gives the Commission the power to carry out pattern approval of measuring instruments to be used for trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an offence under the Act to represent either that the pattern of an instrument is an approved pattern when it is not, or that a measuring instrument complies with an approved pattern when it does not. The penalty associated with this offence is $30,000 for a company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Act stands at present the penalty is unenforceable because the Commission does not have the power to obtain an instrument for examination and, even if it did, it would not have the right to examine it. So that even if a suspect instrument were obtained by the Weights and Measures, the Commission would be unable to enforce the penalty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consequence of this is that sub-standard measuring instruments could be imported and dumped onto the Australian market and, while the Weights and Measures may be able to detect the worst cases, the Commission would be powerless to prevent or redress this situation. The Australian community could suffer in several ways as a result of this:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">equipment suppliers could face unfair competition;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">equipment purchasers could unwittingly invest in sub-standard equipment;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">consumers could suffer from transactions made on the basis of incorrect measurements; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia as a nation could suffer loss of export revenue from the sale of resources such as coal, wheat, wool and sugar if non-complying instruments are used.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is seen as a drafting oversight in the Act, because it is never the intention to legislate for unenforceable penalties. Recently the Commission sought to redress this situation by drafting an amendment to the Act which would allow it to investigate suspected offences by giving it the function of pattern compliance, the ability to test suspected instruments and the same powers of entry and seizure of instruments as Weights and Measures inspectors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because this was seen as the correction of a drafting oversight, was consistent with well-known Commission policy, and was consistent with the previous position of industry, it was not thought necessary to consult with industry about the amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However the amendment was opposed by the WIAA because of the fear that it would allow random sampling of instruments by the Commission on a fee for testing basis. This was an understandable concern because the Commission had been discussing a pattern assurance program with industry (that would involve random sampling and charges to industry) in relation to load cells.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since then, the Commission has given public assurances on two occasions that this is not the case, Senator Button and his office have now given written assurance on three occasions that this is not the case, and the Attorney-General's Department has advised that the amendments do not allow for random sampling or the charging of a fee. The Senate accepted most of the Commission's amendments but deleted the entry and seizure component because it believed such powers should be explicitly defined in the Act rather than in regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commission will be consulting with industry shortly on details of the regulations and details of proposed new amendments of the Act to provide it with investigative powers based on the existing investigative powers of Weights and Measures inspectors.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to deal with the COMPILE system&mdash;the system of electronic lodgment of goods for entry into this country and for disbursement into the community at large. I am sure we are all familiar with the practice that Australia has long had when we used to be sprayed with cans in aeroplanes. Now the spray is put into the air-conditioning system of the aircraft so that we are all sprayed and protected from nasties that might come in. We have been very careful with regard to our quarantine system. We have had sad cases where horses that have served the Light Horse had to be put down and could not come back to this country in days of old. We still go through the most rigorous quarantine in allowing bloodstock into this country. We are quite rigorous in maintaining a quarantine climate to prevent diseases which are unknown to us coming into this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of regulation we are very strict about letting in certain pig semen and the like. We are also very particular about salmon coming into this country, much to the horror of the Canadians who accuse us of using it as a non-tariff barrier. We have had a policy which has been very rigorous in protecting the way in which material or products can come into this country that might bring with those products diseases which could decimate some of the things that we do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in this context that there has been some quite considerable criticism, evidence of which has been given to me, concerning the COMPILE system. Very simply, the criticism is that goods which should be subject to quarantine and inspection slipped through the COMPILE system. Mr Beddall, the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs, has simply denied it. Mr Kelly, the Comptroller-General, has simply denied it. Senator Button, very thoughtfully, one day when he was being quite smart, sent me a big brown paper envelope and inside it were screwed up papers. One of them just happened to be a briefing note relating to the COMPILE system. It makes a very interesting read. It is clearly departmental advice answering the questions that had been raised by Mr Hannah and his company concerning what he used as proof to show that material can slip through the COMPILE system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that stage Mr Hannah used a hypothetical import. The hypothetical import showed that certain products which are listed on these printouts were able to be slipped through the system. He then went one stage further. He actually used a hypothetical entry where no duty was payable where the documentation was actually stamped by the Australian Customs Service in Melbourne, saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">May be delivered and dealt with in accordance with the entry, subject to section 71B of the Customs Act, and any delivery conditions listed hereon. Payment finalised.</PARA>
<PARA>It was dated 14 September 1992. The entry conditions are also listed on the documentation and the entry conditions are nil. The hypothetical product was something called Minimata brand frozen shark fillets. I would have thought the word `Minimata' might have raised some concerns because Minimata was that place in Japan where the gross mercury poisoning occurred and a whole generation of people was sent mad. The other products that were used were Minimata brand frozen shark fillets in breadcrumbs, Minimata brand frozen shark fillets in batter and Minimata brand frozen shark fillets in white sauce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In answer to the allegations that it was possible for things to slip through, the briefing note which Senator Button so kindly sent me said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this was a bogus entry&mdash;but units and Customs were put on alert for a number of reasons including suspect narcotics smuggling. Mr Hannah's little hoax put a lot of people to a lot of time and expense and Customs was right to call him in and demand an explanation from him.</PARA>
<PARA>Interestingly enough, the day we were having this hearing I asked Mr Kelly whether he was aware that Mr Hannah had been called in. He told me he was not. Indeed, Mr Hannah was hauled before the Victorian regional manager of Customs on 22 September. He was given one day's notice and was asked to attend the regional manager's office. He was basically asked to put in writing that he would not put such hypothetical entry through the COMPILE system. This was on the same day of the Estimates hearing when, at page A212, Mr Kelly said of the system:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is certainly working very well.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Drury, who is the National Manager of Import/Export Control, was actually present and he had knowledge of the inquiry. When I asked whether the person to whom the matter had been referred was present he put his hand up; he wanted to give evidence. It will be seen at page A214 that Mr Drury simply was not permitted to give evidence. At page A217, it will be seen that the theoretical consignment passed through the system and that I said it was marked with the words `may be delivered' and dealt with. I wonder whether the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) would like to comment on those events to date. </PARA>

The Comptroller-General provided me with a report, following the investigation about the matter raised on 22 September. The report concluded that the COMPILE system, as part of the total system, is sound and meets all design requirements. There are, however, some identified requirements for some of the profiles within the system. The targeting profiles are being addressed in conjunction with AQIS, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, and IFIP, the imported food inspection program, to redefine and/or confirm risk cargo categories.

A consignment of fish passed through the COMPILE system. Some having passed through the requisite questions of quarantine, other shipments appear to have been randomly passed through. These are real shipments from real importers. Their names have been deleted. I will hold the document up. Here is the documentation all marked, `Australian Customs Service, Melbourne, may be delivered and dealt with in accordance with the entry, subject to section 71B of the Customs Act and any delivery conditions listed thereon.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Fair enough. Thank you. I think it is important to say that there were no drugs involved in this case at all, and no evidence of it. With regard to the question of penetration, it is always a very technical term. Her statement to me does not at any stage indicate that she says that clothes were removed. She specifically says that her clothes were not removed. But it was in no way a frisk in that the penetration took place through the clothing, physically lifting her off the floor. She goes on in great detail as to what transpired with regard to the physical force employed in conducting what is allegedly a frisk search.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern is this. I said that I supported the wish of Customs to have the ability to frisk search, which I believe is a perfectly proper tool for Customs officers to have. I will continue to believe that. But, as in all areas where we give a power or a permission to carry out a particular technique, it can very often be subject to abuse and the person concerned can be abused. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are very concerned in this country that our tourism industry is a great income earner for us and also we like to be known as a people who are hospitable. Nobody could be more concerned than I am that we ensure that we do not have drugs entering this country. I do not know whether Customs has remedied the situation that used to exist at Sydney airport with regard to the vulnerability of containers which are put at risk because of the system that is employed. I do not want to be more specific than that; I do not want to encourage anyone to exploit that vulnerability. But I would be most interested, again, to do an inspection at Sydney airport to see whether that system has improved at all. I would be gratified if it has. I guess I can say that I will not be surprised if it has not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I am asking is that we have an investigation of this matter to ensure that we do not have people taking the frisking power and abusing it in what amounts to a physical assault. An internal investigation where the police investigate the police or the Customs officers investigate the Customs officers is in no way ever a convincing argument. That is why I ask for the Minister's intervention in this matter. </PARA>

The captain of the aircraft thought it was me&mdash;an elderly, respectable gentleman like me frisked by people looking for marijuana.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More particularly, the benefits of the government guarantee flow on to AIDC Ltd. We have seen plenty of evidence that without the government guarantee AIDC Ltd would fall over. It has already traded this past year at a loss of $100m.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fortunately, the Auditor-General, at the insistence of this chamber, still audits the consolidated accounts. Those accounts showed a trading loss of some $32m. The net result is that this year the Auditor-General will not permit AIDC to show in the accounts&mdash;consolidated or otherwise&mdash;that $100m loss as an asset in terms of tax losses or imputation. The reason for that is that it is not reasonable to foresee that in three years it could make a sufficient profit to use up the losses. That is a pretty serious thing for the Auditor-General to say about this operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A government guarantee is tantamount to an open-ended appropriation for that body. The only justification for the government guarantee has always been in terms of the charter set out in the establishing legislation.

Bodies which have community services obligations do answer to Estimates committees. If they did not have those obligations, money would have to be appropriated to pay for that service.

What I am saying is that when one has a ministerial determination on which people have based decisions of long term importance to their financial well-being, the Minister concerned should make it clear that he is preparing to change the rules of the game.

It was there, it was exercised in the past and he, by ministerial fiat, removed it. In the name of justice, he should have at least extended to Defence Force personnel the right which Australian public servants have long enjoyed and that is to be first offered redeployment. These people were not offered redeployment; they were offered redundancy. Redundancy has been in the Defence Force for many years and they believed that they would be able to proceed on those terms. Then they found that they had been cheated. They have not even been given a fair deal equating to that given to somebody who is not in uniform. </PARA>

That is really what the Minister is on about&mdash;just chucking them out into the cold hard world without giving them the same entitlement that anybody in the public sector would have.

Anyone who wanted to put up his hand and say, `No, I am quite satisfied to see out my term' could have done so. The redundancies are relatively generous. The servicemen concerned are treated very generously from a tax point of view; if one has served for over 20 years, one is basically getting a year's income which, when one takes tax into account, becomes a two-year income.

For the honourable senator's edification, we said very early in the process that if 50 people did not fully understand they could not transfer for 12 months into the Public Service, we would help them; we gave that pledge. All the rest who left&mdash;those from the Air Force and the other 460 from the Army&mdash;knew the conditions before they signed off on their redundancies. That is a fact. Senator Newman has brought no evidence in here to suggest anything other than that.

The situation here is exactly the same. Those opposite are trying to beat it up. There has been no injustice done to the Services in this case.

Over time, if we want to meet the dictates of the force structure review, we will have to look for those who may want to be redeployed into other parts of the services. That is a policy open to us at the moment.

I thought those figures were particularly interesting. They showed that there had been substantial cuts in the Defence Force personnel in my home State of Victoria. Unfortunately, I do not have the summary total with me, but it appears that the reductions in Victoria were between 2,400 and 3,000 in that period.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Trainee numbers are down because we are recruiting less because of higher attrition rates which, I think, most people would honestly ascribe to the recession.

It is one of the more training oriented States. The commissioning of HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Melbourne</EMPHASIS> leaving Williamstown accounts for 180. It is now officially stationed in Sydney where the naval base is. The largest area is the closure of supply depots and other restructuring in the logistics area, numbering 1,300. This is all part of the move to lessen numbers at the blunt end of the Defence Force while moving people to the sharp end. It would fall reasonably heavily on Victoria because that is where a lot of the logistics personnel have been over the years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The deployment to Cambodia, for instance, has taken 450 personnel out of Victoria. They are still notionally in Victoria, if Senator Kemp knows what I mean, but they are not there at the moment. Also, the move of the Defence Signals Directorate from Melbourne to Canberra has shifted a number of individuals. I will not give the number for that one, because I think Senator Kemp understands the reason why I do not go to numbers on the Defence Signals Directorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those are the main contributing areas. I would not like Senator Kemp to get the impression that people are being moved out of Victoria for silly reasons.

Unless there is a good reason, I do not think it should be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the long run, probably New South Wales will see much larger figures when the brigade moves north to Darwin over the decade, and when the six submarines and several other frigates move west to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stirling</EMPHASIS>. That will see very large numbers moving out of New South Wales. It is all part of the strategy&mdash;which, I must say, I am delighted to see that the shadow defence policy has endorsed&mdash;of moving west and moving north. Moving resources from the blunt end to the sharp end will mean that those sorts of numbers will occur.

It is quite clear, as we establish new bases such as Tindal and when we establish bare bases, that we cannot keep on establishing bases and not reduce the ones we have. The initial intention of the force structure review was to rationalise the bases at RAAF base Williams, which include Point Cook and Laverton, and move certain areas out in order to achieve savings. In the process of doing that we set up a consultative committee to look at how rationally we could dispose of the bases, especially the airports.

In 1993 it should fall to 2,290, but should then start to go up in 1994 to 2,540 and the same in the following year. So the difference between 1991 and 1995 will be 60 in all.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kemp asked about the airstrips. At the moment there is not sufficient interest for someone to come in and say, `We will take over that area and we will pay for all the upkeep costs and we will be able to make a business out of it'. That is especially true of Point Cook and it is also true of Laverton. The other ingredient involved in Laverton is the prospect of an aerospace museum. We cannot have one of those without a runway. I have always made it clear, though, that just keeping a base there so that we can support a museum was not the sort of economics that any major party would agree with. But if the rest of Laverton is there it is possible to excise off the airport for developments in one form or another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not particularly necessarily attractive for housing at the moment. The local council already has large areas mapped out for housing and light industrial development. There is adequate land in that particular area, as Senator Kemp probably saw when he visited. In the longer term it may well be used for one of those two purposes, and in the longer term we may need to use the airport if we can set up an aerospace company there that wants that sort of runway. It is a limited runway. It certainly takes Hercules and that sort of thing but it cannot take a 747. The prospects for lengthening it run into residential problems at one end and a massive warehouse at the other. Some of those limitations make it slightly less attractive. It is certainly nowhere near as attractive as the potential of using Avalon where there is already a magnificent runway and potential for a second one. </PARA>

It sometimes amazes me that busloads of people jump on a bus and go all the way to Phillip Island, stay for an hour and watch the penguins and jump on the bus and come all the way back. Tourists will do those things provided it is within cooee. This particular site is 30 minutes from the centre of Melbourne, provided one gets a good run over the bridge.</PARA></TALK.START>

I do not think it made any difference to the election down there. Senator Macdonald has probably analysed the Victorian election results and realised that for Labor the effect in the western and northern suburbs was a very strong vote and in the eastern suburbs a very pathetic vote.

I assume, in good faith and on the advice he had, he believed that relocation to Townsville would occur . I must make it clear that there is no predetermined decision that it will not go to Townsville. But we were put in a position in May 1990 where I looked at defence expenditure over the next 10-year period and made the decision to commission a force structure review so as to be able to meet as many of the commitments in the 1987 White Paper as possible and to manage them within what I saw as a resource constraint position in which we would have zero real growth in defence expenditure at least for the three years that I was to be the Minister.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a little broader than that. I was not wanting the Minister to indicate what was in Mr Beazley's mind. That would be impossible for most people&mdash;probably even for Mr Beazley. Obviously Mr Beazley was being advised, and it appears from his press release issued at the time, that the artillery school was being moved because the growth of the city was making it impracticable to undertake artillery practice within easy reach of the school. No doubt the advices are still the same. I wonder what has happened that might cause that reason for moving not now to apply.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was absolutely no doubt in Mr Beazley's mind, and no doubt in his adviser's mind, at the time that it would move and there would be finance, because he went to the extent of indicating that the cost would be $70m. He went on to indicate that planning and design work would begin soon and that the school would have a staff of 200 to accommodate 150 students. It was all fairly definite. An environmental impact study was then under way. So it was not something that he had just pulled out of the air; he had all the figures and all the design. He told the people of Townsville two weeks before the last Federal election that it would definitely go there, that there would be all these jobs and all that money spent there and that the people of Townsville could expect big things because of this. As I say, there were no ifs, buts or maybes about it. </PARA>

The two alternative sites at the moment would be Puckapunyal or Townsville. Secondly, he asks about urban pressures, et cetera. We are not saying urban pressures were necessarily on the school itself but on where it does its live firing. This is clearly the case at Holsworthy. Maybe I will send to Senator Macdonald some of the mail and complaints received every time they do live firing there. There are similar pressures at Singleton, but they are not as intense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He went on to ask what changed from Mr Beazley to me. At the time I came into office, the Forward Estimates had a 1 per cent  to 2 per cent growth rate for defence. My assessment was that that growth rate was not realistic; that we were not going to deliver those. I believed that to leave people with the impression that those rates were going to be delivered was quite a distortion to defence planning. I realised that the best defence would do over the next three financial years would be zero real growth; in other words, adjusted for inflation, the same defence expenditure. Many other countries have cut theirs, but we have managed to keep it real. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In those circumstances, to meet a substantial amount of the objectives we had set ourselves in the White Paper, I issued orders for a force structure review. One of the factors that came out of that review was that we should also look at whether Puckapunyal would be a much cheaper alternative. Mr Beazley did not have that assessment of zero real growth over three years when he made the statement that the school had to move&mdash;I think inevitably the school will move&mdash;and that Townsville was the best option. It may be cheaper to move it to Puckapunyal but, again, there may be restrictions there that could mean that we go to Townsville. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That decision, as I say, is now about a year away and will not be programmed into the financial areas until probably two years after that. The move may not occur until 1997 or 1998. Those decisions are decisions for the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What we always do: resist the pressure, but plan for the future. That is not the only Defence base around the country that has pressure on it. There is increasing growth into what were once remote areas such as Edinburgh Air Force base in South Australia. No-one would have ever considered that there would be urban growth near the remote base and ammunitioning area of Kingswood, New South Wales, yet it is starting to go all around it. We are under pressure from the not-in-my-backyard people all around Australia. In some circumstances we will be able to resist the pressure, because we have no alternative. Where we have an alternative, we will look to long term planning to resolve that issue.

The review took a year to do its work. Its findings were tabled here, in this chamber, a year later. It looked at a whole range of Defence expenditure and how we will manage Defence finances through the next 10 years. It came up with a lot of valuable reforms.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not saying `pork barrelling', but I take the Minister's interjection. When the Minister's predecessor made the announcement three years ago, two weeks before the Federal election, the people of Townsville were very excited. A lot of people spent a bit of money and did a bit of investing. They expanded their premises and put a bit of money into their businesses because of this definite commitment that the money was to be spent. I am trying to ensure that within the next three to four months, or whenever the election might happen to be, two weeks before the election another announcement is not made getting people excited again and then, as soon as the election is over and in the unlikely event that the Government is still there, the promise is withdrawn again.</PARA></TALK.START>

His own shadow Minister is running around promising everyone everything. He reminds me of a 1960s Labor Party policy speech. We used to do that back in the 1960s&mdash;promise everyone everything. Senator Macdonald has been very active in saying that he thinks people made investment decisions based on Mr Beazley's promise. I must say that I very much doubt that. I think he is gilding the lily just a bit there. What he is probably trying to do is retrieve a bit of ground. When it came to putting $20m into the port in Townsville, who opposed it? He did.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first subject matter, according to the running sheet, that I want to raise is Cambodia. I have put in a reservation in view of the uncertainty of the peace process. I want to pursue it a little further tonight, particularly in light of the comments by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Evans) in Question Time today. As Australia obviously has a significant commitment in Cambodia at the moment, it is important that we seek to clarify exactly what the Australian Government's position is in relation to the changing nature of the peace process and the consequential changes that one might conceive in relation to our force commitment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, there have been various reports out over the weekend suggesting that Australia has been advocating various courses of action and that the draft resolution that has been prepared for the Security Council incorporates the views of Australia. In fact, the Minister said in Question Time, with all due modesty, that Australia had played a very significant coordinating role in developing a series of quite specific proposals for consideration by the Security Council next week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, Mr Chairman, is Australia now advocating economic sanctions against the Khmer Rouge and, if so, what form will those economic sanctions take?  Has Australia considered what consequences might flow from the imposition of economic sanctions against that particular faction? How would the sanctions be enforced and, in that enforcement, is it the assessment of the Government that it would be putting the UNTAC force, including the Australian soldiers, at any greater risk, either in the course of directly enforcing the sanctions or in the event of a violent response by the Khmer Rouge in the form of a protest elsewhere in Cambodia?  Recently it was suggested to me in Cambodia that that might well be the response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second subject matter in the same range of issues arising out of this proposed Security Council resolution is the changed nature of the force itself that would result from proceeding with an election process, not on the basis of the original Paris plan, but on the basis of the exclusion of a key faction&mdash;the Khmer Rouge. What exactly would then be the role of the 16,000 peacekeeping troops? Would it be to ensure the security of the electoral process?  What is the risk assessment in relation to that change of function? How is that risk assessment changed as a result of the changed function, bearing in mind it was expected, according to the Paris plan, that the forces of the Khmer factions would be cantoned, that their arms would be handed in and, therefore, that it would be a reasonably peaceful exercise? What would be the consequent change of role of the Australian commitment?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third area is the issue of financial support. I understand that a third part of the resolution will include attempts to get the international community to contribute further to the redevelopment of Cambodia. I am interested to know what additional commitment Australia is making in that regard. At the same time, I would be interested to hear what additional costs there will be to Australia in a changed role of the UNTAC force from that of cantonment to that of securing the electoral process, under which there would be a reduction in the total force, although not a reduction in Australia's contribution to that force. Presumably there would be an extra contribution to be paid by Australia for the extra cost of maintaining the full 16,000 military personnel at least up to or after the election process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order that we might all be better informed as to what the Australian Government has in mind, what it is advocating to the international community&mdash;which we have to pick up through snippets in the news services&mdash;and what consideration it has given to the consequences that flow from these changes, perhaps the Minister might be so good as to inform us on this occasion. </PARA>

I think there needs to be a quite explicit affirmation by the UN Security Council that the elections will go ahead as per schedule in April or May next year, with or without the participation of the Khmer Rouge. That has been implicit in what has happened so far in the Security Council and elsewhere. It has not been explicit and I think it needs to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In association with that, it may well be appropriate to identify with some precision a cut-off point beyond which it would be practically impossible for the Khmer Rouge to come back into the process and still achieve the April/ May deadline. It is a matter for judgment as to how explicit the resolution should be on those matters, but I have expressed an Australian view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter is the question of the appropriate deployment of military personnel in the period up to the election, given the obvious difficulties that have been experienced in the implementation of phase 2. It was anticipated that by about now enough of the cantonment, disarmament, demobilisation process would have been complete for a significant number of the 15,900 external troops to be able to go home with consequent budgetary implications. It will not be possible for those troops to go home in the present circumstances. That cantonment process has manifestly not been completely realised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will be necessary, I believe, for the UN resolution to address this situation and to vest some appropriate discretion in the Secretary-General's special representative as to how those troops are deployed; the object of such redeployment being to better assist in the electoral process, rather than focusing as they are at the moment on a specifically military task, that is, to supervise the cantonment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basic task of UNTAC as a whole remains to monitor, supervise and verify the peace process. It is still a peacekeeping function that is being envisaged, but it may well require a rather different pattern of deployment from that which is presently applicable. The risks that may be associated with that may be of a different order from those that were inherent in the supervision of the cantonment process. We have always had to anticipate, as well as the risk from disease, land mines and so on, the possibility of there being some violence or cease-fire violations and some danger associated with that. Obviously, that is a continuing concern in the present environment. It is impossible to quantify those risks. Those are the kinds of risks that are consistent with a peacekeeping exercise with the kind of mandate the UN troops have at the moment. As I have constantly said, short of a full-scale resumption of military hostilities, I do not think it is necessary to contemplate a change in that mandate, whether or not the international community is willing to contemplate a change anyway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A third question that will need to be addressed is that of the financial implications of maintaining a troop component there for longer than was previously anticipated. I am not sure that that will need to be addressed in this particular resolution. There is a different budgetary process at work within the UN system that does not necessarily require this to go before the Security Council anyway. But my understanding at this stage is that, within the overall budget that has been approved by the UN system, it is not necessary for the moment to seek any supplementation of that. It may become necessary at some stage in the New Year, but we can cross that bridge when we come to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of finances more generally, I do think it is important that the international community honour the pledges that were made for rehabilitation and reconstruction programs. A number of such pledges were made at the international conference in Tokyo in June. Not all of those pledges have yet been honoured in the delivery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very necessary that the international financial institutions make available quickly the kinds of resources that have been contemplated as coming from that source. I think it would be helpful if the UN resolution were to address that question. I do not think that will have any implications for further Australian funding. We have made pledges; we are in the process of honouring those pledges. I do not think we have been dragging our feet and it is not contemplated at this stage that there be any new pledge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, it may not be necessary to address the question of some form of additional persuasive measure being adopted to encourage the Khmer Rouge in particular to come back into the peace process. Whether or not one goes down the path of economic sanctions is a matter for judgment, but I think Australia's view would be that it would not be inappropriate for some kind of message to be delivered that continued non-compliance is not something that is entirely painless for the parties so acting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one is talking about persuasive measures, I guess three questions arise: one, the possible nature of such measures; secondly, the likely impact; and, thirdly, the measure of support in the international community that can be obtained for them. As to the nature of such measures, they essentially fall into two classes. One is in terms of the way in which one can contemplate them. Class one would be full-scale chapter 7 sanctions within the meaning of the UN charter. We are all familiar with that in other contexts. That is a major step to take and one about which a number of countries still have reservations. It is possible, short of going down the path of chapter 7 sanctions, to contemplate less measures that may have to some extent a similar impact, but would not be dressed in that garb. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The SNC has already applied one form of economic pressure in the decision that has already been made to stop the export of logs across the Thai border and elsewhere from 1 January. One thing that could be done is to ensure that that particular prohibition is enforced and practical in its effect. But one has to make a judgment in contemplating measures of this kind and beyond as to whether they will be helpful in their impact or possibly counterproductive. I take Senator Hill's point that one has to be very careful indeed in the judgments one makes&mdash;</PARA>

I have dealt with nature. I am talking about impact and impact is the question of whether they are likely to be productive or counterproductive. There is a case for saying that some kinds of measures may be in their impact, in practice or in the perception of their impact, so draconian as to force a response that may not otherwise be forthcoming.

Since I am now responding to Senator MacGibbon, I thought he might like to listen. On the question of support, a question does arise as to whether there is support generally in the international community, in the P5 and in the Security Council, for going down a particular path. That a is matter obviously that has to be fed into calculations. Secondly, there is the question of support to enable them to actually work in practice through border check points and all the other administrative mechanisms that are obviously necessary. All I want to say about any of that is that we are totally aware of the full range of considerations that apply to this. They have already been discussed in quite a lot of detail in Beijing over the weekend. They will be discussed now by P5 and the other members of the Security Council over the next few days and we just have to see how the balance of international judgment falls out. I think I have given a reasonably full account of our perception of what the relevant issues are and the kinds of considerations that need to be taken into account. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> But we also have to take into account the impact of those things. If it is the case that the impact would be counterproductive in the sense of generating a more aggressive response than would otherwise be the case, creating additional layers and levels of military risk, that is very much a factor to be taken into account&mdash;and it has been taken into account. One of the reasons the Australian diplomacy was so successful in establishing the UN peace plan to start with is that we were regarded by everyone as an interlocutor, a resource, a source of diplomatic energising in this process that could be absolutely relied upon to maintain confidentiality for discussions that by their nature were inherently confidential. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I put it to the Minister that this is not an intellectual exercise. He sent Australian forces to Cambodia pursuant to a peace plan whose terms are no longer in force. Notwithstanding what the Minister said in his answer in the chamber today&mdash;that the peace process has not broken down&mdash;what we are now looking at in Cambodia is a situation fundamentally different from that in which he sent Australian forces. The Minister has told us up until very recently that it was essential to the success of the Cambodian peace plan that the Khmer Rouge be embraced within it and cooperate within it. The plan, as I understand it, was devised on the basis of national reconciliation and the four factions coming together and jointly agreeing to a plan that would proceed to elections and, hopefully, peace.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That process, as I said, has fundamentally broken down in that a key faction, the Khmer Rouge, has not cooperated in a critical phase of the plan; that is, the cantonment and disarmament. What the international community is now looking to do is to proceed not with a peace as previously envisaged but with an election process incorporating the remaining factions, they being those who will cooperate within it. Therefore, I would suggest to the Minister that circumstances are fundamentally different from those which existed when he sent Australian forces to Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister may know, but we certainly do not know and he does not seem to be letting us into the secret, what the Australian Government believes will be the response of the Khmer Rouge to proceeding on the basis of its non-inclusion. Is it the assessment of the Australian Government that the Khmer Rouge will simply stay out of the process; that it will actively seek to disrupt the process; or that it will go further and actually resume extensive fighting, as has been suggested by some commentators in the last few days? With the Khmer Rouge actively in the field during this election process, what will be the response of the SOC armed forces who basically have been let out of the camps because of this breakdown of the critical phase? I think everyone accepts that it was only their aged weapons that they put into the camps anyway, so we are going to have perhaps armed forces of at least two of the factions in the field during the election process. </PARA>

What we are talking about with the Khmer Rouge is, at the moment, the occupancy of some 15 per cent, plus or minus, of the land area of the country and a population at the minimum of 200,000 and at the maximum in the order of 400,000 out of a total population of somewhere between 7 1/2 million and 8 million.

But that is not an unknown phenomenon, unhappily, in political affairs. It was a problem that Malaysia had to confront, for example, for 20 years of communist insurgency in the jungles, active resistance&mdash;sometimes acute, sometimes less than acute. It can be contemplated as a manageable problem. It is not a manageable problem if there is a full-scale civil war being waged, particularly one with external arms supply.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have one further question which really flows from that. If the Minister concedes that a likely outcome is a fragile coalition government of factions that really do not sit easily together&mdash;with a background of economic collapse; with a growing law and order problem; with the Khmer Rouge sitting on the outside waiting for that collapse to occur and, in effect, blaming those who participated together with the United Nations for the current economic crisis; and adding to that this continued emotional appeal relating to the Vietnamese settlers&mdash;is that the sort of peace that we are committed to? Presuming it is not, does that not then mean that the international community is going to have to make a long term commitment to Cambodian nation building that goes well beyond this election process and that, in fact, this election process should now be seen as simply a step along that long path? Is the Australian Government addressing it on that basis?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Hill relishes the prospect. He sits there absolutely relishing the anticipation of what might go wrong because he thinks it might redound upon a policy that this Government, with a great deal of conviction and commitment, has been implementing. Of course we cannot anticipate to the last degree what may happen. We can hope that&mdash;with the degree of international commitment that has been demonstrated to supply funds for rehabilitation and reconstruction, and with the degree of democratic legitimacy that will, ex hypothesi, be invested in a government elected freely and fairly under UN supervision&mdash;the foundations of a reasonably stable nation can be laid, notwithstanding the likely continuation of some difficulty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can hope there will be a continuation of the progress that has already been made. We can hope we will see the return to Cambodia of all of the 350,000 displaced persons, not just the 180,000 who have come back under this process so far. We can hope there will be an infrastructure fully created by the work that is going on at the moment and the input that is being made in communications and elsewhere to create that. We can hope the very uncertain peace that exists at the moment, which is at least better than the full-scale civil war that existed before the plan was put into place, will be maintained. But we cannot be certain about any of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All I know is that a country that has a number of these sorts of problems will not be unique in the world and not every country that has a collection of economic or law and order or even insurgency problems has, in the past, been able to call in aid, the support of the international community, or rely on the continuation of that support beyond a certain period of time. I do not think anyone can make any assumptions about the willingness of the international community, or any individual country like Australia, to go on committing resources once we get past a certain basic foundation being laid for that country's future. I say to Senator Hill: do not make any assumptions about where this will necessarily lead to. In particular, do not make all of those negative, pessimistic assumptions in the way that he does as being the only likely or perhaps even possible outcome of what is occurring. There are plenty of people around who have a high degree of optimism about what we are seeing happening in Cambodia at the moment. </PARA>

I derive no comfort at all from anything that may be going wrong or less than optimally with that process, but I think there is still ample ground to hope, ample ground for optimism and ample ground for continued encouragement of this process from the Opposition rather than a destructive, negative approach to it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On this matter of a high degree of confidence, it is certainly true that there is a high degree of confidence in the UN, in both the civilian and military agencies there. But I want to take the Minister back to his answer to Senator Hill three questions ago when he talked repeatedly about the different circumstances we face today because the resources and supply for the Khmer Rouge have now been cut off. I ask the Minister whether he has considered that that proposition may not be true and, if so, how it affects his plans.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that the Chinese supply of the Khmer Rouge has ceased, but informed opinion in the country is that the Khmer Rouge has sufficient war materiel to run a guerilla war at the level of intensity that it would have to, to cause a great deal of trouble for probably three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, the Khmer Rouge has an income, and there is a huge volume of military materiel available as a consequence of the ending of the Cold War. I put it to the Minister that there is the possibility that, without re-supply, the Khmer Rouge could provide a considerable capability to prosecute the types of wars it has been involved with. Has the Minister considered that possibility and, if so, what are his contingency plans?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course we have considered that possibility. Some of the matters that Senator MacGibbon raises have been the subject of informed speculation. Just how extensive the caches of materiel are, and whether they are enough to sustain activity for two years or three years, nobody can be absolutely certain, but there is certainly an accumulated amount of such materiel. It is certainly the case that there is a significant economic income flowing. That is one of the reasons why some kinds of economic measures remain on the agenda, although with all the degree of difficulty in discussing and applying those that I mentioned earlier on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a matter of making a judgment as to whether a capacity to cause significant guerilla-type disruption, short of full scale civil war, is enough capability to lead the Khmer Rouge to make the judgment that it can afford to embark upon that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All I can say is that nobody can give an absolutely clear-cut answer to these questions at the moment, but they are exactly the sorts of questions that we are giving close consideration to. The range of contingencies that flow from different assumptions are absolutely on the table at the moment. That is what we spend our time talking about&mdash;if this, then that; if that, then something else. It is not a naive, stumbling forward into the dark. It is premised on a continuing commitment to try to do the best we possibly can for this poor, benighted country which has suffered so much. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is certainly a poor, benighted country that has had an incredible amount of suffering. I would agree with that. I want to take the Minister back to his answer to Senator Hill's first question. It was in relation to the 11 infantry battalions that are there. The Minister said that since cantonment has not succeeded, the battalions will have to stay on and will not come home. My understanding was that an estimate was made of the number of army personnel in the various factions there, on the basis that 80 per cent of them would be cantoned, and that is how the figure of 11 battalions was arrived at. Cantonment has virtually been ineffective and, at most, about one third of the force is cantoned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There seems to be very little reason for retaining those battalions there, given that fact and the fact that when one talks to people like Mr Akashi and various other UN people, they simply will not contemplate using those military personnel in any military role other than in a passive sense. Given the huge cost of this program, why are the battalions which are not being used not repatriated?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are functions they can usefully perform other than engaging in full scale military response to military attack. There are obviously the guarding kinds of duties that will necessarily be associated with the effective conduct of the election process, particularly in an environment where so many of the factioned armed forces will not have been demobilised, but will be out there armed and potentially active. That is a guarding sort of exercise that, I guess, is one possible form of deployment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another form of deployment is the kind of strategy that is articulated as being within the scope of peacekeeping by the Secretary-General in his agenda for peace report recently; the concept of preventive parameter deployment around particular land areas, where they are trying to establish a degree of impermeability&mdash;non-movement into other areas. Obviously, how effective that kind of deployment may be depends on the geographical dispersion of the relevant forces. It also depends on the extent to which it is possible physically to stop something occurring. But the concept of preventive deployment with a merely peacekeeping mandate is available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think anybody, as yet, wants to do anything other than just create an environment in which these options are open. It is not a matter of some fully fledged redeployment exercise being in train.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is difficult to give any kind of authoritative answer to that because UNTAC personnel, who would be monitoring, among other things, the human rights situation and the welfare of the people in an area, have simply not been allowed access into those areas of the country which are Khmer Rouge controlled. Only about 15 per cent of the land area satisfies that description and only a very small proportion of the population is involved. But it is just not possible to make that judgment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as we can tell, there is no particular adverse activity occurring within those areas. If anything, the Khmer Rouge has been very actively pursuing a kind of hearts and minds policy so far as the peasant population of those areas is concerned.

I assume that was designed specifically with the proposed election in mind where the people would have had a say.

Should there not be some further consideration given to that question?

It is a very large assumption that there are still people in the Khmer Rouge areas&mdash;in respect of which some continuity of control has been maintained, after all, all the way back to 1975&mdash;that are at risk by virtue of their opposition to what the Khmer Rouge is all about.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Minister may not be aware of that since he was overseas.

Of course, these political campaigns are designed to really help the re-election of the Government. I want the Minister to take on board not only the concern that we have on this side of the chamber but also the fairly widespread concern within the NGO community. He seemed to be saying this to me and, if I misquote or misunderstand him, I would certainly welcome correction. The ACTU seems to dispose of vast amounts of money, lots of which seem to be directed either into Labor Party activities or to assist Labor Party campaigning, and yet the Minister does not seem to make any assessment of whether the ACTU itself should be required to fund more of the foreign aid program of its foreign aid arm.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not going to repeat the answer I have already given except to add this further point: that the ACTU is an industrial organisation with an industrial charter, and its primary responsibility is to spend its members' funds on the pursuit of industrial objectives. The pursuit of humanitarian and overseas aid objectives necessarily and reasonably can be expected to occupy only a relatively small proportion of its total expenditure as a citizenship interest, if you like, on the part of its members in doing good works overseas. For that reason, APHEDA has been established as an effective NGO to pursue those objectives, but necessarily it has to rely, to a very large extent, on outside funding because the ACTU has other priorities for the great bulk of its activity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without getting into too tendentious a political argument at this hour of night, I simply do not accept the premise of Senator Kemp's opening remarks about the difference between political and industrial activity. We might as well say that the Kennett Government ought to be confining itself to purely political activity and not doing anything which has an industrial impact, if the honourable senator is  going to say that the ACTU should confine itself to things which are purely of an industrial character and should not engage in anything which has a political impact. The two things are necessarily enmeshed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The political program adopted by the present Victorian Government is having a devastating impact on the established terms and conditions of industrial workers whom the ACTU represents. The ACTU, perfectly naturally, is supportive of those elements of the trade union movement that are taking action to resist that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, with the Fightback business, of course it is a legitimate expenditure in an environment where the ACTU has been so active across the whole spectrum of activity over the last 10 years in guaranteeing workers' real incomes through a variety of strategies, not just through formal industrial strategies but through securing tax benefits and other forms of wage supplementation, through the social security system and so on. It is a sophisticated array of means to achieve a common objective: that is, to improve, or at least maintain, workers' standards of living. That is what the ACTU is involved overwhelmingly and primarily in doing in the expenditure of its money. Its aid operation is very much a subsidiary objective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Government, in making funds available to that aid organisation, is not doing it for the pursuit of any domestic objective but wholly for developmental aid objectives.

For the record, I quite fortuitously have before me a table which shows that the average real earnings of a male with dependent spouse and two children in 1982-83 was $26,686. In 1991-92, nine years later, in real terms that annual after tax earnings figure had fallen to $25,954. It is the worst record. The table goes back to World War II. Frankly, in protecting real workers' entitlements, one would have to say it has been a disastrous failure&mdash;and that is excluding the one million unemployed figure, which has been created as a result of the accord.

Perhaps the Minister, in a supplementary way, will tell me the proportion of money which goes towards the provision of overheads, which certainly would be of help to the ACTU.

The Committee has expressed concern at the actions and conduct of the head of the Commonwealth statutory authority&mdash;namely, Dr David Cook, who is the Executive Director of the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its report, the Committee expressed concern about what it believes to be a breach of proper standards of conduct to be observed by a person occupying such a highly paid and responsible position. This issue arose because the local Federal member, Mr Robert Tickner, M.P., spoke publicly in opposition to the siting of a nuclear reactor at Lucas Heights. He did so because of the rapidly expanding residential development adjacent to the reactor site. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his public comments, Mr Tickner made it clear that he remained committed to the maintenance of jobs at Lucas Heights and the rights and interests of ANSTO employees. The Committee has found that the assertion by Dr Cook, which was reported in an official ANSTO publication, that Mr Tickner had pre-empted the announcement of an inquiry into a new reactor at Lucas Heights was incorrect. The Committee also notes other reported comments of Dr Cook in the official ANSTO publication which, in my view, are, by a clear implication, directed towards Mr Tickner and follow directly on from another criticism of Mr Tickner by Dr Cook. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee further notes with approval that the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free) has acknowledged that Dr Cook's remarks were intemperate and that the conduct should not be repeated. The Committee is strongly of the view that it is improper for public servants in Dr Cook's position to enter partisan political debate in such a manner. The Committee is also of the view that it is the responsibility of public servants to ensure that a range of options are made available to government in an unbiased manner for consideration and that it is then the role and obligation of public servants to give effect to government policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issues raised by Dr Cook transcend party politics. They are fundamental issues of proper public administration and the proper relationship between public servants and elected members of Parliament&mdash;elected members who have a right, and indeed a duty, to speak publicly on issues which are important to their constituents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must add a personal note. I have had a long association with the Sutherland area. I am personally aware of Mr Tickner's longstanding good relationship with employees of ANSTO and CSIRO at Lucas Heights and with the trade unions that represent them. Indeed, he has a public record of outstanding defence of the rights and interests of ANSTO and CSIRO employees. For Dr Cook to convene a meeting of these employees and to then publicly vilify Mr Tickner before those employees is a serious and damaging misrepresentation of his position. It would clearly be in the interests of Dr Cook, and indeed of the ANSTO board, for action to be taken to set the record straight in relation to Mr Tickner's clearly articulated views on matters of importance to his constituents. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been suggested to me that that task is a complicated and difficult engineering feat which would cost tens of thousands of dollars. That is not the case. The roll of honour can be retrieved without an enormous amount of difficulty, although at some cost, and a new roll can be prepared with Mr Clarke's name on it. I suspect that, because of its care in this matter, the Vietnam Veterans Association would pay the cost of that exercise to the National Capital Planning Authority. However, the funds required to undertake that exercise would normally be provided to halfway houses and other areas of welfare to which the Vietnam Veterans contribute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In light of the fact that the Department of Defence was in error in providing the list of names which did not include Mr Clarke, it should undertake to pay the cost of that operation. I hope that the Department of Veterans' Affairs might see justice and compassion in having Mr Clarke's sister&mdash;who came across for the original dedication; she was quite shocked and distressed to find his name not on the roll&mdash;flown across and a private ceremony held where the roll is replaced in the memorial and subsequently sealed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I rise tonight to follow up Senator Bjelke-Petersen's speech last night on imported foods and labelling. The labelling issue is very important to Australia. It shows that consumers all over the country are very conscious of the labelling requirements at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the consumer the country of origin of all imported foodstuffs is very important as is the right of all Australian consumers to be informed as to whether the food they buy comes from Australia or anywhere else. Countless surveys have shown that Australian consumers want to buy Australian. According to these surveys, consumers are very aware of the very high quality of Australian foodstuffs. Australia is known as a clean country with clean produce, which is something that the Government has given great support to. It recognises the high health standards applying to Australian produce and there is also a commitment to buy Australian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surveys show that Australian consumers wish to buy local produce and would even pay a premium to buy Australian if they had to. They express a great commitment to support local industries and appreciate the effect on the Australian economy of buying locally. Buying Australian is a very important issue for Australian consumers. The public is more and more aware of unfair trading that follows the massive subsidies given in some countries and how their food surpluses end up being dumped or subsidised in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last year many successful anti-dumping and countervailing cases have been won against dumped and subsidised food products. These were for products such as canned tomatoes, canned peaches and pears, canned ham, glace cherries and egg whites. Presently pork imports are the subject of an anti-dumping and countervailing action. Unfortunately for many Australian industries, market share losses of 25 per cent to 40 per cent of the domestic market were lost to dumped and subsidised food imports prior to the anti-dumping and countervailing actions being launched. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national grocery market is enormous. It accounts for $25 billion every year and, according to the ACTU, one in eight jobs depends directly or indirectly on the food industry. There is an enormous commitment to buy Australian and the vast majority of the Australian public want to put it into practice. The only way they can do this is to know whether the products they are buying are made in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key to this lies in the label on the product being clear and easily read. When the National Food Authority came into existence last year it took over the responsibility for country of origin labelling. Prior to that, Senator Tate had been the Minister responsible. During this time country of origin labelling made excellent progress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under Senator Tate's guidance significant achievements were made so that imported unpackaged fruit, vegetables, nuts and fish had to be labelled stating that they were imported by displaying a sign 4.5 millimetres high at the point of sale. Also, imported fruit juice has to be clearly labelled as imported, which removes the past sham of imported concentrate mixed with Australian water bearing the label `product of Australia'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there are still areas of country of origin labelling that need immediate attention and remedy. When requirements were introduced for imported unpackaged foods, imported meat was not included. Since that time Australia has been hit fairly hard with imports of Canadian pork. After first coming into Australia in August 1990, Canadian pork imports rose to nearly two million kilograms and acted to depress local prices by up to 25 per cent. These importers are presently undergoing an anti-dumping and countervailing action, but the effect of a large presence of allegedly subsidised and dumped imported pork on the domestic market has resulted in local producers suffering enormous&mdash;and in some cases irreparable&mdash;damage from subsidised imports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many Australian processors and retailers have shown a great commitment to the Australian product and will only use or sell Australian pork products. However, the Australian consumer wants to know whether the meat or the processed meat products they buy are made from Australian or imported raw materials, as in the case of the imported Canadian pork that I referred to. There can be no difference whether the imported unpackaged food is fruit, vegetables, nuts, fish or meat. The Australian consumer wants to know where the unpackaged meat, just as much as the other unpackaged foods, comes from. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, I call on the Minister responsible to act so that our labelling requirements for unpackaged foods are consistent. Some bodies associated with food products have recently applied under section 17 of the National Food Authority Act to the National Food Authority to double the present country of origin labelling size from 1.5 millimetres to three millimetres and to have the country of origin label appear on the same side as the contents and brand name. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its recent decision the National Food Authority rejected the size increase, saying that if labels currently in use are not legible and conspicuous, it is an enforcement issue rather than a food standards issue. However, I would like to point out to the Senate that the Food Standards Code which governs this issue requires that country of origin be written distinctly, legibly and indelibly so as to be conspicuously visible to a prospective customer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, prospective customers must be able to easily read the label when they are looking to choose the product, which would be when it is sitting on a supermarket or shop shelf. With a print size of 1.5 millimetres it is impossible for the prospective customer to read the country of origin print, as mentioned in the Code. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is set out in the Act that the National Food Authority must set food standards which include labelling so as to provide adequate information to enable consumers to make informed choices and to prevent fraud and deception. It follows that a customer must be able to easily read on a label which is legible where a product comes from. If the printing is 1.5 millimetres it is just too small for the customer to read this information when the product is sitting on a supermarket shelf. I know that Senator Tate often told the Senate when answering questions on country of origin label size that shoppers should be presented with as much information in order to make choices while shopping which will benefit Australian farmers and orchardists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The labelling of foodstuffs is not a trivial issue. Australian food produce is of exceptional standard and quality. Australian farmers have spent decades and enormous sums of money in research and development of their products to reach the internationally enviable level they have now reached. Many of our products command a premium price on world markets because of their consistent and superior quality. This is an advantage that we should never lose as a nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our future wealth depends on sustained growth in these products, but our high quality food products will decline and even disappear if they are replaced by other products which compete on an unfair basis. This can arise from unfair competition from dumped and heavily subsidised imports. Also, it can arise because Australian consumers are not able to see clearly that the product they are buying is an Australian product that they wish to buy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prominent and effective country of origin labelling is of fundamental importance here. It was most encouraging that this was the line of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) when he addressed the sixth Small Business Forum in Sydney in October. On that occasion he pledged $4m over the next two years to the campaign to promote the `Australian made' symbol. He said that he had been very aware of the problems that have been encountered recently by some doubtful labelling practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He announced a fast track legislative program by the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms McHugh) to have clear definitions of such terms as `made in Australia', `product of Australia' and `manufactured in Australia'. But the Prime Minister's $4m investment in Australian products will only be effective if the label size stating where the product is made can be read by the consumer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area in which labelling is seen as important is that of our highly successful wine industry. The wine industry's label integrity program is there to reinforce the quality of the industry and its product. If it can work there, why not for the whole Australian food industry? Look at its successful export program based on quality and integrity. The relevance of the wine industry is that we also have a highly developed and successful horticultural</PARA>
<PARA>and agricultural industry which the Australian public wants to support and see prosper and grow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment, the National Food Authority is further investigating the application to increase the country of origin labelling size for unpackaged food. It is also further assessing the proposal to have a consistent declaration for country of origin labelling for all unpackaged food. However, this process is lengthy; meanwhile, the pork industry is suffering irreparable harm because meat was left out of the original category for unpackaged food which included only fruit, vegetables, fish and nuts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I call on the Minister responsible, the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe), to exercise his power of direction over the National Food Authority by directing the Authority, in the interest of consumer awareness, to increase the size of country of origin labelling and also to immediately correct the oversight and anomaly by including meat with all other fresh, unpackaged foodstuffs that must bear country of origin labelling. </PARA>
