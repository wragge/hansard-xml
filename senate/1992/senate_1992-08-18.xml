<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate for the opportunity to make a short statement. Next week marks six years since I was appointed as a senator for Victoria, and today I take my place in the sixth different seat in which I have sat in those six years. This movement reflects the constant change which is an integral feature of life in this Parliament. Indeed, change is for me an essential feature of politics. My political life has been dedicated to achieving change and reform and my new status today is very much a consequence of that process. I take my seat today as an independent senator for Victoria, having resigned from the Australian Democrats on 31 July during the parliamentary recess.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My decision to move on from the political party of which I was a founding member 15 years ago was not taken lightly or precipitately, nor was it a decision made for personal or emotional reasons. It was a result of long and careful consideration about how best I could continue to serve the people of Victoria in pursuing my strongly-held philosophical and political viewpoint. At a time when 20 per cent of Australians are saying that they reject the old party system, I, too, am saying that a new kind of politics is needed&mdash;the politics of consideration and cooperation which will be truly in touch with its community base and work to meet the real needs of the people it represents. </PARA>

I say to Senator Macdonald that, for example, I reflect on the magnificent work done by former Senator Peter Baume which played a large part in enabling the passage, unopposed, through the Parliament of my private member's Bill which banned the print advertising of tobacco products. On the other side, I look forward to a successful result on the question of discrimination against homosexuals in the armed forces as a result of important strategic cooperation between myself, Senator Margaret Reynolds and other Labor Party backbenchers.</PARA></TALK.START>

I expect that to be especially the case with the Australian Democrats as I continue to subscribe to their basic philosophy and the consequent policies which I played a role in developing over the past 15 years. I am sure Senators Harradine and Chamarette will have wise counsel to offer me as experienced independent senators and I assure them that I welcome their advice. </PARA>

<PARA>More out of sorrow than anger we note the retirement of Senator Powell from the Australian Democrats, and, not surprisingly, the Australian Democrats would also have noted that they have plummeted in the polls to a record low. I think some 5 per cent of Australians now are offering support for the Democrats. That is not surprising. If they cannot keep their Party together in the way that they have demonstrated of recent years, it is not surprising that the people of Australia have so rapidly lost confidence in them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind you, Mr President, that this is not the first of the Australian Democrats senators to resign and to condemn her colleagues in the form that she did the other day, although she did not do it today. I remind you of former Senator Siddons, who I think was a Deputy Leader of the Australian Democrats, who some years ago resigned from the Party and said terrible things about his colleagues of that time and about the Party of which I think he was also an inaugural member. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember also from my own State the very highly respected Senator Vigor, who resigned and at that time said terrible things about Senator Powell or Senator Haines. The point is that this was the party that was not going to be a party in the form of others. As Senator Powell said to us today, she now feels the need to again reject the `old party system', to use her words, in which she now incorporates or includes the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats have not kept the bastards honest, as the then Senator Chipp promised. They have not been prepared to come into this place and introduce new standards of behaviour or requirements that they said were deficient in the major parties&mdash;the Liberal Party, the National Party and the Australian Labor Party. They have failed to be able to maintain any form of common entity, as has been shown by the disillusionment that they demonstrate in each other, and really they have forfeited their right to any confidence of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that they have now plummeted in the polls demonstrates that the Australian people have lost confidence in the Australian Democrats. There is no worthwhile function for them any longer in Australian politics. If they do not divide further and split off&mdash;we thought another one might go with Senator Powell but it does not seem to have happened just yet&mdash;it would be better if they threw in the towel, because they are not setting the standard they claim to have set and, therefore, are serving no useful function within the Australian democracy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. Given the Treasurer's assertion yesterday that it is not in the Government's interest to publish forecasts which have no credence or which are shown in time to have been based on other than sound professional judgment, why did the Government publish forecasts only a few months ago in the One Nation statement of 4.75 per cent growth in GDP for the year 1992-93 which it knew to be wrong and, to use the Treasurer's own criteria, which have been shown in time to have been based on other than sound professional judgment?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, in February 1992 when the forecasts in the One Nation statement were put down. But I notice that a number of Liberals, including the gruesome twosome, Dr Hewson and Mr Reith, have had a go at this issue in the past few days. In fact, Dr Hewson&mdash;the very brittle Dr Hewson&mdash;has had a go at every issue in the past few days. Anybody who has criticised any of his policies has been attacked by him in the past week or two. On the question of forecasts, the Opposition has had something to say.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make some general observations about forecasting, and the Opposition is in this business too. There are all sorts of projections and forecasts in the Fightback package which are absolutely ludicrous&mdash;and everybody knows that to be so. However, the forecasts of recent years have underestimated the strength of the boom in the Australian economy. That was true for official forecasts in Australia, for other Australian forecasts and for forecasts of the international economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The technical fact is that the worldwide deregulation of the financial system meant that old yardsticks in relation to forecasting were no longer applicable. In these circumstances, the assets price boom and decline had a greater than anticipated effect. For example, the OECD has been quite out of kilter in its forecasts relating to world growth in the late 1980s and in terms of the world decline in the early 1990s; the forecasts here have mirrored that fact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition immediately jumps to the conclusion that forecasting errors, which are a consequence of world deregulation of economies, are some sort of plot&mdash;and of course they are not a plot. The attack on the integrity of the Treasury is another in a sequence of attacks by the Leader of the Opposition on the institutions of government. He has made them on the Reserve Bank as well as the Treasury. He attacked the Reserve Bank and argued that every reduction in interest rate was politically motivated&mdash;a deliberate attack on the integrity of the Reserve Bank. In all these measures, the Leader of the Opposition has jumped to conclusions about forecasting, which is an imprecise art in terms of timing, if nothing else. Forecasting in respect of timing is not a precise art, and that is true of private sector forecasts as well as of government or public sector forecasts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion&mdash;and I understand that this matter will be discussed further in the Budget Papers to be presented tonight&mdash;the Treasury forecasts have got the picture better than the average of private sector forecasts in this country in the past three or four years.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BS4">Senator LOOSLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and it concerns the Australian Wallabies tour of South Africa. Does the suggestion that the African National Congress may withdraw its support for the Australian rugby tour following the incidents at the New Zealand-South Africa test match now put the Wallabies' tour in jeopardy? Has the Australian Government played any role in this dispute, and is the Minister in a position to make any observations regarding the manner in which the ANC has approached this issue?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators will be aware from media reports of the particular incidents which have precipitated the question mark that has now been placed over the Wallabies tour. In short, they involved a group of white South African rugby supporters interrupting in a manifestly crass way the observance of the proposed minute's silence called as a mark of respect for those who died in recent violence in South Africa; doing so by launching into a singing of the official South African national anthem; that then being followed immediately by the playing of that national anthem by the local rugby officials in direct, overt and deliberate breach of an agreement and understanding that had been reached between the South African Rugby Union and the officials of, respectively, the New Zealand and the Australian visiting teams. The object, of course, of that agreement is that potentially divisive political symbols not be intruded into a situation where it was generally accepted that the matches should go ahead in the spirit of reconciliation at a time of real tragedy and real suffering throughout the country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is highly regrettable that a group of white rugby supporters and officials should have reacted in that deliberately divisive way, thereby casting a shadow over the tour and, indeed, South African rugby's continuing participation in international competition. It is worth appreciating that the South African Rugby Football Union has directly and explicitly disassociated itself from these various actions and has expressed regret over the incidents. SARFU has confirmed that it will honour the understandings that were similarly reached, without any direct involvement, I should say, by governments in any way so far as the Wallabies' tour is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to what the outcome will in fact be about the future of the tour, I can only say this: the ANC is still considering its position and will have further meetings this week with the peak South African sporting body, the National Olympic and Sports Congress. Mr Joe French of the Australian Rugby Football Union has expressed his optimism that the Australia-South Africa game will still be played. My own belief, on the basis of communications with our Ambassador in South Africa, who has been in close touch with all of the key participants in this exercise, is that that optimism is pretty well founded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ANC and black Africans, although legitimately very upset about what happened in Johannesburg, are approaching the issue I believe in a mature and responsible way. Certainly, the Australian Government very much hopes that the Wallabies tour can go ahead in a climate of goodwill and in that spirit of reconciliation among South Africans that has enabled, after all, the country to return to international sporting competition. But I repeat that it is entirely a matter for the discretion and the judgment of the footballers and their officials&mdash;the players and the ARFU&mdash;whether they decide to continue with the tour. It is not in any way a matter for the Australian Government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not at all, Senator. I just regret the waste of Question Time. As Senator Short well knows, I have already answered this in part in talking to the question put to me by Senator Hill. There were anticipations in February this year about the growth rate of the Australian economy which have not been fulfilled. Those anticipations related to the world economic outlook, which has changed. It is in the light of that, substantially, that the forecasts have been revised downwards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the size of the deficit, Senator Short has taken an aggregate figure over two years and asked how that could possibly happen. As I said in answer to Senator Hill, all projections in respect of the growth of the Australian economy in the late 1980s missed the very high level of growth which was taking place. Since then, projections about the rate of growth have also been inaccurate, by all forecasters; there has not been anybody in Australia who has got it exactly right. Part of the reason for that is that we have a substantially deregulated economy compared with the economy which we inherited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The causes of the increase in the Budget deficit&mdash;do not nod your head too much, Senator Kemp, or it will fall off&mdash;are substantially the ones which we have identified in Question Time and debates in the Senate over time. Of course we have had a weaker economy and lower than previously expected inflation. We have also had lower interest rates and higher unemployment because of reduced activity in the Australian economy. Everybody knows that; there is nothing new about it, and Senator Short would know it as well as anybody else.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The forecasts have been prepared by the Treasury in respect of the Budget which will be presented tonight. When we are talking about the dismal art of forecasting, I make the point that, in respect of the 1991-92 Budget, apart from less growth than we anticipated in the economy, there were a number of other variables in economic indicators for which the forecasts were right or wrong. For example, there was a projection for much higher inflation than we in fact had. That was a consequence of the lower level of growth in the economy.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it can. We are witnessing in Australia and in Australian workplaces a quiet revolution as we devolve the centralised wage fixing system more and more to the workplace setting. This latest agreement, which was ratified by the Industrial Relations Commission on Friday and which occurs under the reform amendments which we made in the Senate in the last session and which were proclaimed by the Governor-General on 22 July, is a good example of workplace bargaining under our model. It occurred without industrial disruption. It is an agreement that is closed for two years and economic adjustments are built into it. It is also an agreement that contains payment for productivity that will be generated during the life of the agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an agreement that covers one of the largest companies in Australia&mdash;General Motors-Holden's, which has a huge work force&mdash;and thus must be counted as a significant model for other companies in the private sector that wish to go down the route of workplace change. We saw a number of workplace agreements go before the Commission before the Act was changed. There were 120-odd covering between 150,000 and 200,000 Australian employees. This is one of the most significant agreements to go before the Commission since the Act was changed, and I now expect that a flood of others will follow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the Government's point of view, we have opened negotiations with the public sector unions for workplace&mdash;or, as some call it, enterprise&mdash;bargaining within the Australian Public Service. At this stage it is too early to call as to date of conclusion or shape of the outcome, but the early signs are that considerable progress will be made. As a consequence of the sorts of changes we envisage, the Australian Public Service will be a model for other public services in the world and a benchmark as a best practice public service for others to follow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of the General Motors-Holden's workplace agreement, as I have said, it is closed for two years. It excludes General Motors-Holden's employees from national wage case increases. The productivity measures that are included in the agreement include just in time production methods, improvements in work organisation and improvements in maintenance procedures. The agreement provides wage increases related to both productivity and economic factors, and provides for an 8 per cent rise in wages over two years and an additional 2 per cent payable over the life of the agreement, which is linked directly to measurable improvements in customer satisfaction. The agreement is similar to other closed agreements covering Toyota and Ford and, as I have said, the proposed Australian Public Service agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a quiet revolution that is taking place. It is a managed decentralising of the centralised system. It is occurring by consensus. It is proof that our industrial relations model works. It is to be contrasted to the big bang theories of the Opposition&mdash;theories which a number of Australia's leading businessmen have rejected in past weeks and theories which are fundamentally rejected by the community.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We were having a chat about this, but I feel I should share it with the Senate. I am pleased to advise the Senate that on 1 August&mdash;the beginning of this month&mdash;I signed a memorandum of understanding with the New Zealand Minister for Transport, Mr Storey, on future aviation arrangements between Australia and New Zealand. The objective of achieving more competitive trans-Tasman links between our two countries was outlined by the Prime Minister in his One Nation statement in February.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The memorandum of understanding does in fact represent a significant step by both countries for the common objective of a single aviation market and it is good news for the tourism trade and the travelling public. The memorandum provides for multiple designation of Australian and New Zealand airlines by November this year. This will provide the opportunity for another Australian carrier to provide some services across the Tasman from November, with an increased range of services next year and full access by November 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both countries are actively addressing important facilitation and terminal issues to assist in passenger and freight processing arrangements across the Tasman. The agreement also facilitates an expansion of beyond rights for both Australian and New Zealand carriers over the next two years.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to tourism, the agreement will clearly enhance Australia as a tourist destination from New Zealand, which forms a major market for Australia.

Mr Peacock was the last one to publicly buy into the debate when he said&mdash;and it is interesting to have a look at Mr Peacock's statement in relation to the successful completion of this agreement with New Zealand&mdash;that the Australian Government should simply give to Air New Zealand whatever it wanted. This is the so-called open skies policy being proposed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document by the Opposition with a total disregard for the very legitimate interests of the Australian carriers involved.

The level of CPI inflation in 1991-92 was 1.9 per cent. When those opposite left office, the figure was 11.5 per cent. When those opposite left office, the level of employment growth was minus 1.7 per cent. Even last year it was only minus 1.6 per cent. The current account balance, which Senator Macdonald referred to, was minus 3.8 per cent of GDP in 1982-83; it is minus 3.1 per cent in 1991-92.

If the people of Australia are as concerned about issues as those opposite say they are, why are those opposite not at a 70 per cent level in the polls? Why are they lumbering along at a miserable level? If people take the dismal view of this country that those opposite take, why are those opposite not doing better in the polls?

I determined that an officer should be sent from Canberra to establish the facts, and chose for this purpose Mr Peter Davin who had been Senior Administrative Officer in the post from 1986 to 1989.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I discussed matters with Mr Davin on or about 20 June, before his departure for Ireland. He told me then that he recollected discussing with Mr Burke the terms of Administrative Circular 180/87 relevant to Mr Burke's wish to purchase a third vehicle duty-free. It is this recollection of his which I recorded in para 9 of my note of 20 June (attached at `B') to Mr Dauth, then your Principal Private Secretary:  as will become apparent below, the conclusion I drew here about Mr Burke's knowledge of the Circular was overtaken by the outcome of Mr Davin's further discussion with Mr Burke on 25 June and also facts which came to light about administrative failures in the post.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 20 June I spoke to Mr Burke for the first time by telephone about the issue. He expressed surprise at my description of the terms of the Administrative Circular which led me, as I recollect events, to then read out the relevant parts of it to him. He maintained that he thought the rule was that he could own three vehicles duty-free at any one time, and that there was no particular limitation on the total number of duty-free vehicles that could be purchased during the course of a posting. In that first discussion, he also acknowledged that he had to conform to departmental requirements and asked what could be done to regularise the situation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On his arrival in Dublin, Mr Davin conducted a search of the relevant files, with which he was familiar, and came across the note in which Mr Burke sought his advice on the purchase of a third vehicle. In response to Mr Burke's request for advice on policy on the purchase of a third duty-free vehicle, Mr Davin on 31 August 1988 had attached the text of Administrative Circular 180/87, but apparently without its attachments which provide sample certifications (including a form of acknowledgement that the instructions relating to the purchase of cars have been conveyed, and a briefing upon them given). Mr Davin's handwritten annotations of 31 August 1988 on that note focused on two aspects. First, he wrote that approval for the purchase of a third car had to be sought from Canberra. Secondly, in response to a specific question in Mr Burke's memo, Mr Davin went on to outline the importance of ensuring vehicles are sufficiently used so that no impression is created of profiteering and purchase simply for resale. In submitting the Administrative Circular (less its attachments) to Mr Burke, Mr Davin highlighted one sentence of the text, namely the last sentence of paragraph 9, which concerns this matter of sufficient use and reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"Thus a car which was held for a short part of posting or held in a garage and proposed for sale with less than a minimum reasonable distance on the speedometer in circumstances where resale at a large profit was possible, would be assumed not to be for personal use unless demonstrated to the contrary".</PARA>

Mr Burke's comments are recorded by Mr Davin by hand on the same document on 25 June 1991. Mr Burke told Mr Davin "that he has no recollection of seeing the guidelines but assumes his attention was focused on the highlighted section not the Administrative Circular in its entirety". (The highlighted section&mdash;as stated above&mdash;is the last sentence of para 9, the answer to his specific concern about "limited mileage".)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Administrative Circular 180/87 and the procedures set out in it were designed to ensure that all officers of the Department are aware of their obligations with respect to access to duty-free purchases.

Records are to be kept of the details of the information provided to officers, when this information was provided and who provided it. Officers are also expected to record the details of their purchases and sale of duty-free vehicles. These procedures are designed to ensure both that officers are properly informed of their obligations and that there is a record that they have been so informed. I therefore asked Mr Davin to provide me with the details of Mr Burke's certifications, which would show that he had been properly informed of his obligations. Mr Davin advised me that, while as Senior Administrative Officer he had required all other officers in the post to complete these formal processes, he had not required Mr Burke to complete them.

Against the background of this new knowledge, I had to assess Mr Burke's consistent advice to me and to Mr Davin that he did not know about our rules and that he thought that he could own three duty-free vehicles at any one time.

Given that these procedures had not been followed as they should have been, and given that the record shows that only two elements of our rules on this matter (those concerning purchase of a third vehicle) had been drawn to his attention in 1988, I concluded that, on the grounds of fairness and natural justice, I had no option but to accept Mr Burke's consistent advice in June 1991 that he was not aware of our rules.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">alcohol and cigarettes</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">sale of vehicles</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Abuse of these and any other diplomatic and consular privileges makes officers liable for disciplinary action under the Public Service Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Use of the black currency market is prohibited. Where the official rate or rate at which officers transfer money to a country differs from the "real" or black market rate all Australia-based officers must obey the regulations and exchange all moneys at the prescribed rate. Allowances are calculated on the basis that officers use the official rate of exchange.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Due to the high tax on alcohol and cigarettes imposed by some countries, and their ready availability for sale, it is necessary to stress that such items must be purchased only for personal use and official representation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cars have on occasions been the subject of abuse of diplomatic privilege and it is reiterated that officers have a duty to ascertain and adhere to local laws regarding the purchase and resale of cars. It is expected that cars imported or purchased will be for personal and family use during the period of posting. Thus officers may purchase and import a car only in their own name. It is a breach of diplomatic privilege, and a disciplinary offence under the Public Service Act for an officer to import a car in the name of another officer. Purchase for the sole purpose of resale, even within local regulations, is an abuse of diplomatic privilege. Thus a car which was held for a short part of posting, or held in a garage and proposed for sale with less than a minimum reasonable distance on the speedometer in circumstances where resale at a large profit was possible, would be assumed not to be for personal use unless demonstrated to the contrary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">10.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purchase of more than two cars in a posting exercising diplomatic privilege is also an area for possible abuse and could have adverse implications for the Department. Therefore I have decided, and now advise all staff that heads of mission are not authorised to approve the purchase by any officer of more than two cars under diplomatic privilege in the course of a posting. This covers cars purchased under diplomatic privilege by an officer, his or her spouse or family member. Any proposal for the purchase of a third car under diplomatic privilege must be referred to the First Assistant Secretary, Corporate Management Division. In general such proposals will not be approved apart from exceptional circumstances of family need, e.g. where vehicles have been involved in accidents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Role of Missions</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">11.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like all Posts to undertake a thorough and prompt review of procedures for the administration of the import, purchase and disposal of goods duty-free or tax-free under privilege and their conformity with current local regulations. As a first step, Posts should ensure that they have complete and up-to-date records of the host State's laws and regulations on exemptions from duty and tax including rules on the use and disposal of goods purchased duty-free or tax-free. Where necessary, these laws and regulations should be translated and clarification sought from the local Foreign Ministry as to the operation of particular rules.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">12.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each Head of Mission or Post is to ensure that instructions setting out the regulations regarding import, purchase and disposal of goods duty-free and tax-free are made known to each Australia-based staff member and are given to each new member of staff. These instructions must be signed by the head of mission and issued before the end of this year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">13.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These instructions will vary from post to post depending on local circumstances. It is important however that the procedures in force in the mission:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)ensure that any officer purchasing a vehicle duty-free has the conditions of resale brought to his or her attention and signs an undertaking that he/she understands the conditions (sample attached);</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)ensure that there is only one point in the mission through which applications for duty-free purchase or registration of the vehicle are passed to the local authorities and that all staff understand this; any direct approach outside that mechanism would be regarded as a breach of lawful instructions subject to disciplinary proceedings;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)maintain a complete register of all vehicles purchased and disposed of under diplomatic privilege; this would record details of the vehicle as set out in the attached form, as well as the registration number and mileage on disposal; details of this register would not be sent to Canberra but would be checked by internal audit teams and would be available on request;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d)include my instruction that no more than two cars may be purchased duty-free in the course of a posting without reference to me or my delegate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">13.At some posts, borrowing money may expose officers to pressures from financiers to bend the rules or to grant unacceptable favours. In many countries, there will be little scope for compromise, apart from the question of officers overcommitting themselves. However, in those countries where a risk of compromise is possible, the head of mission or post should ensure that the attention of officers is drawn to identified risks.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">14.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am confident that with the co-operation of all officers overseas, effective and efficient procedures can be developed for every post which will ensure that each officer fully understands and implements regulations in a way which raises no problems for the conduct of our foreign policy overseas.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An issue has arisen in Dublin as to the number of vehicles Mr Burke has purchased under diplomatic privilege.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Admin. Circular 180/87 set out specific rules about how many cars officers may purchase in a posting. A copy of the Circular is attached.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paragraph 10 of the Admin. Circular states that Heads of Mission should not authorise the purchase by any officer of more than two cars under diplomatic privilege in the course of a posting. Paragraph 13(d) says that instructions in every post should make it clear that no more than 2 cars may be purchased in the course of a posting without reference to the Secretary or his Delegate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the evening of 18 June Steven Brady telephoned to say that he had some concerns about Mr Burke's car purchases under diplomatic privilege and their conformity with the requirements of this Admin. Circular. The Senior Admin. Officer had just sent a diplomatic note to the Irish Foreign Ministry requesting permission to sell three cars without payment of tax or duty. Mr Brady had examined the relevant files and found that Mr Burke had in fact in the course of his posting appeared to have purchased 6 cars duty free.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an explanation for the purchase of 4 of them. Mr Burke was given permission by the Department to purchase a third car duty free because the number of children of driving age in his family. This approval was given in accordance with the last two sentences of para. 10 of the Admin. Circular.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of these three cars was written off in a crash and a replacement purchased. This would have been consistent with the last two sentences of para. 10 but the files in Dublin do not indicate that approval was sought from my predecessor. In any case, we believe he may have paid all taxes owing to Irish authorities on the vehicle that was written off.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A problem arises with the purchases of the fifth and sixth vehicles. The vehicles were purchased on the sale of vehicles 1 and 2 after he had owned them for two years. One of the new vehicles appears to have 18 kilometres on the odometer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There may be special circumstances in the purchase of vehicles 5 and 6 of which we are unaware and on which Dublin's files are silent. The information we have so far, however, could indicate that Mr Burke has purchased two more vehicles than he should have.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The intent and purpose the Admin. Circular was known to and understood by Mr Burke because Peter Davin tells me that he discussed it with him. This discussion was the basis of the approach to Canberra to buy a third car. The purchase of the fifth and sixth vehicles came after Davin's departure.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not go into all the detail now, but the main points made by Mr Forrester in that report, in summary, are as follows: the administrative circular was, as a result of an administrative failing within the post, never properly distributed to Mr Burke in accordance with specified procedures. He was not briefed on it as he should have been, nor was he required to certify that he read it as he should have been.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, it is the case that a highlighted portion of the circular was brought to Mr Burke's attention on one occasion as an attachment to a memo which he noted on 31 August 1988. But that was in the context of a particular query about a particular purchase and Mr Burke has subsequently denied having any recollection of the terms of the document as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, Mr Burke's denial of any recollection of the relevant content of the circular has been consistently maintained: in a telephone conversation with Mr Forrester on 20 June last year, in a note that he wrote on 24 June and in discussion with the investigating officer, Mr Davin, in Ireland on 25 June. Mr Forrester concludes in his report&mdash;I will conclude on this basis; I see no reason for second guessing my officer in this respect&mdash;that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Senate Estimates Committee on 4 September 1991 I answered questions against the background of my knowledge that Mr Burke had never had distributed to him Administrative Circular 180/87 in accordance with our procedures, and of my conclusion . . . that, on the grounds of fairness and natural justice, I had no option but to accept Mr Burke's consistent advice in June 1991 that he was not aware of our rules.</PARA>
<PARA>The material that I have tabled&mdash;Mr Forrester's report&mdash;does contain the full text of the administrative circular with its attachments. I will also table&mdash;when I find it&mdash;in response to Senator Knowles's specific request, a copy of the administrative circular in the form in which it was actually shown to Mr Burke as an attachment to a memo. I will table the memo in question as well. There is a highlighting of one particular part of that document that does not show up in the Xerox, but Mr Forrester's report identifies the passage in question that was so highlighted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that this material gives a full explanation of what, on the face of it, does require some explanation; I frankly acknowledge that. The explanation that I have given, with the documents thus tabled, is a very full one and I believe that it completely puts to rest any suggestion that there has been any misleading of the Senate, either deliberate or inadvertent, certainly by me and certainly also by my officer.</PARA>

The international community, including the United States, has for the past two years consistently called on Iraq to comply with the UN Security Council resolutions or to face the consequences, and the Australian Government fully endorses that approach. Through our contacts at the UN and through consultations with senior officials in Washington and other capitals, we have kept ourselves closely informed about developments relating to Iraq.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are greatly concerned that Iraq persists in flouting the authority of the UN resolutions by not cooperating with the UN's plans for disclosure and destruction of its weapons of mass destruction; by continuing to violate the human and political rights of the Kurds and the Shiah, contrary to resolution 688; by failing to renew the Memorandum of Understanding with the UN under which the humanitarian program in Iraq operates; by refusing to allow oil to be exported in accordance with Security Council resolutions 706 and 712; by refusing to participate in UN-sponsored talks on setting the Iraq-Kuwait border; and, indeed, by repeatedly asserting its claim to Kuwait in contravention of resolution 687.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The UN resolutions, particularly resolution 687, authorise such further steps as may be required to implement all the provisions of the resolution and to secure peace and security in the area. The United States Government has said on many occasions, and certainly not just since the presidential election campaign has heated up, that it does not rule out any option to force Iraq to comply with the will of the international community as expressed in those resolutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the second part of Senator Jones's question about the current state of Australia's commitment, if I can answer in this respect on behalf of Senator Robert Ray, whose responsibility it is, Australia has been a longstanding contributor to the multinational naval force carrying out sanctions duties in the Gulf and the Red Sea. HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Darwin </EMPHASIS>completed its latest tour of duty in the Red Sea in July. There is presently a gap in our commitment due to operational reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a small office in Bahrain which supports Australia's ship deployment in the Middle East and Australia's contribution to UNSCOM inspections in Iraq. We have contributed a number of military and civilian specialists to the work of UNSCOM, the UN body that is charged with locating and rendering harmless Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and missiles. At the moment there are five Australian Defence Force personnel serving with UNSCOM in varying capacities relating to the location and destruction of those weapons and missiles. Two of the personnel are scheduled to depart Iraq in the near future. In addition, there are several ADF personnel serving on exchange with US and UK forces and it is possible that some could be asked to deploy to the Middle East with their host units. Approval has already been given for three ADF exchange officers to be deployed to the Middle East. Australia also has 12 military observers attached to UNTSO on UN peacekeeping activities covering Israel, Syria and Lebanon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the final part of the question&mdash;what Australia's role might be in any future enforcement exercise in the Middle East&mdash;it is simply not appropriate for me to speculate about the further steps that Australia might take were Saddam Hussein to continue to deny UN inspectors access to military installations. Certainly, it would obviously be preferable for all concerned if the Iraqi Government were to see sense now and comply with the resolutions, as it is obligated to do. Saddam Hussein would be very ill-advised to underestimate the will of the international community to enforce compliance in all these respects.</PARA>

Why has the Government, with its stated commitment to recycling, changed the rules overnight and deliberately chosen to threaten the viability of an emerging Australian owned industry which adds value to wastepaper? Will the Minister confirm whether the two large multinational companies which already have an 80 per cent share of the market benefit most from this decision?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, if I can have a go at what Senator Evans fell foul of, it is a sort of salacious question about multinationals and all that sort of stuff. It is a Democrats' salacious question. Let me say on the principal issue that the Australian pulp and paper industry's recycling performance has been very good by world standards, and probably Senator Kernot knows that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In absolute terms wastepaper usage increased from 560,000 tonnes in 1980 to 911,000 tonnes in 1991. Recycled facial tissue forms only a small part of this industry&mdash;a very small part. Available evidence suggests that the sales tax exemption for recycled toilet and facial tissue, exercise books and paper bags has contributed little to the objective of saving native forest. Rather, it had led to distortions in the wastepaper market, with high quality waste being directed to tax exempt and often single use products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A sales tax exemption is only one means of promoting environmentally sound practices. There are a number of other initiatives in place: for example, the recently announced national waste minimisation and recycling strategy will provide a direct means of encouraging recycling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In so far as there are two major companies concerned, I think Senator Kernot was probably referring to Bowaters and Kimberly-Clark. They are, in part, multinational companies. There is nothing intrinsically evil about that, although the implication was that there was something evil about it. Amcor, an Australian company, as I understand it, is a very significant shareholder in Kimberly-Clark. It is not an exclusively foreign company in that sense. Both those major companies are strong growth businesses exporting from Australia&mdash;I think that is to be encouraged&mdash;but that was not the reason, as I understand it, for the decision at that time.</PARA>

In view of the fact that Queensland is the third largest State in Australia, will the Minister take action to provide a migration review office in Brisbane?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The announcement is very good news for South Australia and came about as a result of the transfer of some 60 per cent of Australian National's current operations to the organisation now known as National Rail, which of course cast some question mark on the future operations of the remainder of Australian National's operations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question that was pre-eminent in terms of the passenger operations of Australian National was the future viability of the Indian Pacific train. I know that Senator Tambling would be aware that that viability also hinges on the Ghan because the two services very much operate together. If Australian National were to lose one, that would seriously jeopardise the continued viability of the other. So I must say that personally I am extremely pleased with the Government's decision to provide this very substantial level of support for the continued operation of the Indian Pacific. As Senator Button would know, the Government gave serious, very detailed and lengthy consideration to this issue. I am pleased that the decision was taken to refurbish this train.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The upgrading of the Islington and Port Augusta workshops will put them in the best position possible to compete for ongoing National Rail maintenance business. These initiatives together will create substantive spin-offs for South Australia. Not only will they secure and maintain the jobs of 1,000 employees but also they will improve the efficiency of rail activities operating in the State generally and, hence, will create new opportunities for expanding those activities. This will do no harm at all to South Australia's aspirations, referred to by Senator Schacht, of becoming a major rail hub.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the greater impact will come through the National Rail initiative and the decision to standardise the Adelaide-Melbourne line. Efficient mainline freight operations will improve the potential for landbridging of freight through Adelaide.</PARA>

The question remains as to how best to organise these activities to maximise the ongoing viability of the residual Australian National operations. Accordingly, the Federal Government, as part of the same decision, has asked the Commission to provide its views on how best to do this through a detailed business plan, which will be submitted to the Government by the end of October.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister stood up glibly after Question Time and virtually said, `Gosh, golly, gee, I have misled you again', without ever answering my question as to what mechanisms have been put in train to determine the truth or otherwise of the serious allegations that have been made. To try to blame poor Mr Forrester yet again, as distinct from any other departmental officer, just will not do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the guidelines that set out how the Minister is meant to deal with the issue. I dare say that he has not even bothered to read them. I asked for a copy of his Department's personal version of them, and I received a two-page note, the most important paragraph of which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Staff are reminded of their right to make complaints.</PARA>
<PARA>It then has a list of the sorts of things that might comprise the complaints. However, it is utterly silent on the question of how they are to be dealt with. So I can only conclude that they are to be dealt with in accordance with this publication, which remains valid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This document says, `Mechanisms for Resolving Cases of Sexual Harassment'. At no stage does it say that an officer shall conciliate. What is meant by `conciliation'? Does it mean that the complainant has to compromise? There is not a single, solitary syllable about conciliation in this document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The document says that the matter is to be investigated. I asked the Minister how he has established this investigation. First of all, he said that the Secretary of the Department just might have whispered in his ear that one was going on. Then he told us that no, it was the Deputy Secretary. What is the formal nature of the inquiry? Yes, these guidelines provide for informal and formal grievances to be lodged. They also require the Department to act, even if the complainant does not wish to go on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an implied inference in all of the reporting of this matter that Senator Evans, as the Minister, would like the matter to just go away. The fact is that, immediately, we read an article in the paper which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A spokesman for the Department said last night that it had a good system for dealing with allegations of sexual harassment. "It allows people to make their concerns known without fear of victimisation".</PARA>
<PARA>Where in the so-called conciliation process can the woman who has made the complaint see justice? Obviously she must have felt very strongly about the matter to have raised it in the first place. </PARA>

The Minister says he is terribly sorry that Burke did not know the rules, but it is not Senator Evans's responsibility. </PARA>

There is an aspect that is common to the three matters Senator Bishop has referred to. I refer first to the Burke matter, on which the Minister sought to give an answer with regard to Senator Knowles's question today&mdash;I refer specifically to those matters relating to Mr Burke that the Minister has been required to answer for the last 18 months&mdash;secondly, the Richardson matter with regard to the Marshall Islands, and, thirdly, this one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is common to these three matters is that the Minister has a personal interest. Burke is a former Premier, a Labor leader in Western Australia, and was the appointee of this Minister to the post of Ireland and the Holy See; secondly, Senator Richardson was a close colleague in Cabinet of this Minister; and thirdly, Mr Butler, who has undoubted diplomatic skills, has developed a closeness to this Minister which I think the Minister would honestly own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When these people, who are close mates of the Minister, are subject to a question in the Senate, the Minister's reaction on all points&mdash;Senator Bishop is correct in the protest she makes in moving this motion&mdash;is that he goes over the top. He is not calm, he is not clear and he is not convincing. Yet when a question is asked about Australian aid to Somalia or the Australian position with regard to Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Minister can give a clear and calm answer. But when it comes down to mates, this Minister, instead of giving a calm and clear answer, goes over the top, makes totally reprehensible remarks about a member of the Senate which are quite uncalled for&mdash;I grant that he withdraw them&mdash;and shows that he is unable to give a competent answer in a matter for which he ought to be responsible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the motion moved by my colleague Senator Bishop. I rise because of an issue that Senator Cooney raised&mdash;that is, whether we would have expected Senator Evans to have been across this particular issue. This issue has been in the press for a number of weeks and it is surprising that Senator Evans came into this Parliament so poorly briefed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An article appeared recently in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> which gave us some detail of the work which Senator Evans's Department carries out in briefing Senator Evans for Question Time. Over a six-month period, the Department prepared&mdash;and Senator Evans will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;707 possible parliamentary questions. Those questions were prepared for Senator Evans to make sure that he was well briefed on the issues that we wished to bring forward to him. Out of the 707 possible parliamentary questions, there were apparently none about the Marshall Islands affair, which is interesting. The article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, which I suppose Senator Evans has not read because he is so poorly briefed about so many matters, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The long and short of it was that Senator Evans had not been told a lot of details about these cables&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>These, of course, are the cables relating to the Marshall Islands&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No-one had foreseen the strife ahead and no PPQs had been written. Questions without ready answer in the Parliament left Senator Evans variously flat-footed, embarrassed and furious.</PARA>
<PARA>But Senator Evans was not going to leave it there. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Departmental officials have now been told, in plain language, that this time their entire careers could hang on the quality and inspiration of their PPQs. Departmental and government officials insist that the creation of PPQs is valuable democratic work.</PARA>
<PARA>So 707 PPQs later, we have a very serious issue which Senator Bishop raised today. One would have thought that the 708th PPQ might have actually dealt with this matter. But Senator Evans came in here and, as usual, tried to bluster and bumble away and indulge in abuse of senators who raise these issues.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) has really scored the trifecta today with Burke, the Marshall Islands and Butler. Senator Kemp has adequately pointed out the amount of work that appears to go on in the Minister's office&mdash;which is useless&mdash;and that it somehow manages to avoid the main issues of the day. Quite clearly, from the attitude of Senator Evans during Question Time, he obviously regards the question of a woman making a complaint against an ambassador of this nation, somebody whom we send overseas to represent the interests of Australia and whom we expect to behave in a particular way, as flippant and without any substance or, indeed, the need to treat in a serious vein.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the comments he made indicated the way in which he was treating the matter. If he were a man who took the issue seriously, he would have seen the reports in the press; he would have heard the interviews that Mr Butler carried out; he would have asked his Department for a proper briefing; and he would have been on top of the matter and the way in which it was being investigated. Quite frankly, whether the complaint is formal or informal, I expect that the woman concerned has made a statement; that Senator Evans has given the matter to a particular officer to investigate; that that officer has sought to take evidence or at least have discussions with people who may have been witnesses or to whom she would have spoken after the event; that Senator Evans would have sought to have spoken with Mr Butler after the event; that he would have sought to have complied with the regulations as set out in this document; and that he would have had a serious view on how the matter was in fact proceeding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike Senator Evans, there are people who consider this matter to be very serious and, indeed, consider the cavalier way in which he treats the matters of Burkegate, the Marshall Islands and now the Butler affair as things that can be swept under the carpet as in fact meaning that he is not carrying out his duty as a Minister under the Westminster system. There are many people who ask questions about whether Senator Evans's temperament makes him suitable for the job he has.

That is not the point that other people are concerned about. People are concerned that there has been a very public report of this matter which the Minister chooses still to call informal.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, time was extended on that occasion but Senator Kernot should bear in mind&mdash;I do not want to be sidetracked for too long on this issue&mdash;that the Table Office, which is primarily responsible for maintaining the schedule, had worked through the preceding night. It was pretty heavy stuff in terms of workload. I think we all understand that and no-one is critical of the circumstances of that occasion; what we are concerned about is to remedy the matter as effectively as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government had several choices. One was to actually bring the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Bill into the Senate to have the offending non-existent amendments deleted. The reason why the Government has not done that is that it is clearly terrified that what is left of the nervous nellies might decide, on second thoughts, to move some fairly substantive amendments to the Bill. Clearly, whether or not we did that, even if we were so tempted or minded, would not really matter unless the Democrats agreed with us. Clearly, the Government's concern was that the Democrats might go to water and, therefore, seek to move a number of amendments which might actually start to cut this Bill, as it now is, to shreds. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it does not and I am not saying that the Democrats have; I am saying that the Government thinks they might. That is what it is about and that is why we are proceeding in this fashion. Otherwise, it would have been a simple matter of the Senate excising the amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is worried that the Democrats might also be tempted to move other amendments, such as our preferred course in relation to a variable contributions tax or rebates, which we all agree&mdash;and I think every commentator in the land agrees&mdash;is a much more equitable manner of proceeding. The outfit that is chock-a-block full of verbal compassion these days certainly will not have a bar of it when it comes to superannuation. It is in the business of not giving low income earners anything like a fair break. It is in the business of flat rate contributions taxes, which we all know will have a devastating impact on the results that will ultimately flow through to low income earners from compulsory superannuation. That is part and parcel of my amendment and I will come to that in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have an important question that I want to put to Senator McMullan, if I can distract him for a moment. In his statement, the President says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there is a question as to whether the bill will operate retrospectively if it is now passed or whether further amendment is required to provide that retrospective operation.</PARA>
<PARA>I have no doubt that Senator McMullan has taken advice on this matter. He would know that a Bill is presumed to have prospective operation only. There is, in other words, a presumption against retrospectivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, the normal course of events is to clearly and unequivocally prescribe the intention that a Bill has a retrospective effect. The courts have frequently declared that, in the absence of some clear statement to the contrary, an Act will be assumed not to have retrospective operation. It can be done. There is nothing to stop the Parliament legislating retrospectively. There are very good public policy reasons why it does not and why, if it does, it does so at its peril because there is usually a large number of members of the public who are quite severely outraged by retrospective action, particularly if they are directly affected by it. The courts, naturally enough, are very reluctant to allow an Act to have retrospective effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this situation we have a guarantee Bill which says that it starts on 1 July. It is quite clear from the Acts Interpretation Act that the commencement date of the Bill will be the date on which the Bill is passed and that will be, at the earliest, 18 August. We cannot simply backdate it automatically because of the fact that it went through the Parliament on a day after the date that it was supposed to have commenced. Therefore, I would have thought we very much need to have an express provision that shows the clear intent of the legislature that it should commence from 1 July. If we do not, we proceed at our peril. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator McMullan would well know, there are a number of groups out there&mdash;indeed, I would have thought the majority of the business community, particularly the small business community&mdash;who know that the Government's compulsory regime is going to take them to the cleaners. It will impose intolerable burdens on them. Once again, if we accept the Treasury estimate&mdash;which is precisely what the Government's advertisement would have the populace believe&mdash;if employers bear the full cost, up to 100,000 jobs will be lost, and there is a very real temptation for, perhaps, the Australian Confederation of Australian Industry and others to challenge this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I would have thought it very important that the Government take advice as to whether simply having the Bill go back to the House of Representatives to have those four amendments removed, and then be passed on to be given royal assent, is sufficient in the circumstances, or whether the Government is leaving itself open to a devastating legal challenge. If there is one way of achieving the ultimate confusion and chaos in the area of superannuation, I would have thought it would be to proceed down the track with this compulsory regime and then find later on that it is all invalid. I specifically ask Senator McMullan whether he has taken legal advice or whether he has sought legal advice&mdash;indeed, whether he has sought any formal or informal soundings&mdash;as to the status of the legislation, and whether it is likely to be at risk in the courts if we simply do not have it brought back to the Senate as, clearly, the Government is afraid to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Speaking briefly to the amendments which have been circulated in my name, I think the first point is self-evident. The reason why a lot of the current problems arose is the unnecessary and indecent haste that the Government pursued. We all know that people were screaming blue murder in the weeks leading up to 1 July and saying that it simply was not possible to put the whole thing in place by that date. Until the Democrats caved in at the last moment, it was looking very dicey. But, of course, at no stage was the Government prepared to contemplate an extension of time; it insisted on 1 July. So there was a guillotine in the House of Representatives and very strict time limits imposed here, and this is simply a clear product of that approach by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The words `failure to follow the proper processes' refer to what could easily have been done by way of providing in this chamber and in the House of Representatives for an express provision, making it clear that the Government intends the Bill to have a retrospective effect. Again, the only reason that the Government is not prepared to do that, I presume, is that it is terrified that the Democrats will somehow go to water. If there is a better reason, I would like to hear about it. Otherwise, the Government will have a question mark over this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, I will move that the Senate records its unequivocal opposition to the compulsory superannuation regime. I have no doubt at all that in the months leading up to the next Federal election the ordinary workers will become aware that they are the bunnies in this game and that, far from the advertisements being accurate in telling them that somehow the boss is picking up the tab, it will dawn on them that they are picking up the tab. </PARA>

The employer could no longer continue to pay the money that he would have to pay for three employees and he closed the section. So three people lost their jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would say to the Government that, at this stage even, it should reconsider whether it is appropriate. It is not open for the Government or anyone to say that I am not in favour of superannuation; I am.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan)&mdash;or somebody else who spoke about this in the debate&mdash;said that the employers were bearing the full burden. To an extent, they are, in that they have to provide the funds, but I suggest to you, Mr President, that it is the employees who are bearing the burden when, as a consequence of this, they lose jobs. If that is what the Government wants to see as a reasonable outcome to its legislation, I think it should give very serious thought to what it is doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the operation of the Government's legislation, I wish to refer to a particular matter that I have had brought to my attention. A constituent of mine, a women&mdash;and it is significant that it is a woman who indulges in part time and casual work from time to time, and is not in full time employment with a particular employee&mdash;worked for 20 hours per week on a casual-part time basis from January 1991 to May of 1991. She then left because she had reason to do so, or the employment may have been just for a particular period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She did not know, when she started off in this employment, that her employer was required to pay 3 per cent towards her superannuation. It was really only near the end of her period of employment that she found that out, and received a letter about it. When she had completed her employment, she found out the grisly details of what, in fact, had happened to that money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that during the period of time that she had been employed, her employer had paid $165.05 as the 3 per cent superannuation tax that was required to be paid to Canplan Multi-industry Superannuation Plan 330. her number, as a member of that plan, was 36463. What she, in fact, received at the end of it all was $34.69. The actual amount of money that she was to have received was a fraction more than that&mdash;$44.05&mdash;from which the superannuation company deducted PAYE tax of $9.36. So the cheque she received according to her group certificate was for $34.69. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, she did not know she was in a superannuation scheme. So, in a sense, she was not really getting anything that she was expecting. But she was incensed to think that this sort of rip-off is being perpetrated by the Government; that there are probably people in schemes like this&mdash;people like herself, who go from one scheme to another&mdash;who, in fact, are not covered realistically for superannuation at all. It is a superannuation company, registered by the Government, whose operations are clearly approved of by the Government, that is getting all of the money out of the scheme, and women, in particular, who are inclined to  this  type  of</PARA>
<PARA>part time employment, are the ones who are missing out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If she had happened to have gone immediately to another employer whose superannuation was with that same plan, the scheme could have been carried on. If she had not realised that she should take the money out&mdash;if she had been sufficiently misguided to think that it was a superannuation scheme and that, perhaps, she should leave her money in it&mdash;it would not have taken very long at all for the remaining $44 to have been eroded to absolutely nothing. She might not have known about it, but she certainly would not have got any benefit at all. </PARA>

I ask the Senate to think back to June, if we can think back that far, to the pressure under which we were working at that time. The Parliamentary Secretary, when he first spoke and moved the motion, said that this was not a high point in the history of the Senate. Had he not said that, I may not have made any further comment upon this but, in view of that statement, I think it is important to point out the pressure under which the Clerks of the Senate were working at the time. Certainly, a clerical mistake has been made in a section of that part of the Senate&mdash;everybody recognises that&mdash;but the one thing that is absolutely certain, is that nobody can attribute fault to the Clerks who were working in conditions which any employer ought be condemned for allowing to operate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate, at that time, was coping with 69 Bills with just under 36 hours of Government Business time in which to deal with them. It was operating under a guillotine with more amendments to those 69 Bills than I could possibly have counted myself. At the time in question, the day these Bills were passed, the Broadcasting Bills were also passed&mdash;and anybody who has listened to the Senate or taken the slightest interest in what we were doing would know exactly how detailed, complex and large that package was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the day in question, three major packages of Bills reached the third reading&mdash;under guillotine, of course. After we had left this place, the Clerks had to stay and incorporate all of those amendments into the documentation which went to the House of Representatives. It is not just a matter of picking a piece of paper off the Clerks' table and sending it across to the House of Representatives showing what we have done. Those amendments have to be incorporated into the legislation, they then all have to be checked to make sure that they are in the right place and they then have to be proof read and eventually transferred to the House of Representatives. In addition, at this time, there were 70 procedural matters to be drafted and prepared for the Senate the next day when we came back again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we were sitting quite absurd hours at that time, and I am talking about the Clerks who finish much later than we do and who start earlier. The fact is that most of the Clerks worked all through the night one night, or so near to all through the night as to make little difference. The fact is that several of them worked from coming in at 8 o'clock on the Wednesday morning until 3 o'clock the following Friday morning, without returning home. That, by my calculations, is 43 hours. There may be certain extreme circumstances in life where one may be required to be up and active for 43 hours, but there can be no justification whatever for the Senate imposing those working conditions on any of its employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Presumably, during that time they had an hour's break here and there to have a meal&mdash;I certainly hope so&mdash;but the circumstances under which the staff of this Parliament, the Clerks of the Senate, were required to operate in that week stand to condemn all of us who are involved in those hours being sat. I shall not comment upon how it was that we came to work past 10.30 p.m. as often as we did at that time. In terms of occupational health and safety, it is absolutely criminal; in terms of just reasonable behaviour from one person to another, it is absolutely outrageous that this should happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not surprising that a small mistake occurred. Probably the surprising thing is that more mistakes were not made during that time. People were required to work unreasonable hours under pressure. A government which talks about compassion and looking after people needs to stop and think about what it is doing when it treats its own employees in this manner. I am sure that something far more significant would have been done if a union had been involved. However, the clerks of the Senate will not let the Senate down. They tolerate the absurdity of our behaviour because they have a very high regard for the Senate, its role in the parliamentary system and the work that they do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that this was not a high point in the history of the Senate, let everybody be quite clear that it happened because of the program that the Government was running at the time and the way in which it was forcing legislation through the Senate. As I said, the Senate had 36 hours in which to deal with 69 Bills. It should be remembered that when we go home the clerks still have to do everything that is necessary to transfer the documentation to the other place. That is the reality of what happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps it is a blessing that this happened. The Government has been given an opportunity to behave more sensibly towards the business community of this country, many of whom have gone broke and many of whom are going broke. The passage of this legislation should be deferred so that some people who would otherwise lose their jobs will be given a bit of a chance. The Government should take advantage of what has happened and think about this matter again. </PARA>

Let me remind the Senate that on the very day that this incident occurred there were 161 amendments to legislation. In addition, seven of the Bills dealt with that day were subject to the guillotine. We all remember that there was not time for us to consider the propositions that came before us by way of amendment. I believe that there was not time for us to consider in substance the legislation itself. As Senator Reid has said, on that day the Senate was considering three substantial packages of Government legislation, all of which were under the guillotine and all of which required amending. But very few of those amendments were properly considered. We were not given time to consider any of them. It is little wonder then that there was confusion. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ERROR IN RECORDING OF SENATE AMENDMENTS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The schedule of amendments made by the Senate to this bill which was forwarded to the House of Representatives on 24 June 1992 contained 4 amendments which were in fact not agreed to by the Senate. These amendments had been circulated by Senator Alston. Although he indicated during the proceedings on the bill that he did not intend to move the amendments, somewhat ambiguous references to them, which do not appear in Hansard but which are recorded on the video tape of the proceedings, misled responsible officers into believing that the amendments had been put and carried. My attention was distracted from the proceedings during part of his speech. I subsequently queried whether the amendments had in fact been carried but was assured that they had. This error was not detected by the House of Representatives or by departmental officers monitoring the passage of the bill, and the erroneous schedule of amendments was circulated in the House of Representatives when it agreed later that day to the amendments made by the Senate. When the error was detected on Monday last, it was decided by the government that the bill could not proceed to royal assent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While I very much regret this error, I believe that the view that the bill cannot proceed is mistaken. In accordance with the usual procedures, the House of Representatives passed a resolution the effect of which is to agree to the amendments made by the Senate in the bill. That resolution did not have the effect of endorsing the erroneous schedule. It is the documentary record of the proceedings which is incorrect, not the proceedings in either House, the effect and intention of which are perfectly clear. To say that the bill now cannot pass because of the error in the schedule is to say that the erroneous record of proceedings prevails over the proceedings themselves. It is not correct, as the government's advisers seem to have concluded, that the Houses have not agreed to the bill in the same form. It is clear that the Houses have agreed to the same bill; it is the documentary record of that process which is inaccurate. The record should be amended to reflect the proceedings, rather than the proceedings altered to reflect the record. I put this view when the error was discovered, but it appears that the government's advisers have decided otherwise, mistakenly in my view.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I should also point out that part of the cause of the error was the sense of urgency which is always placed upon the return of bills to the House of Representatives at the end of a period of sittings. The responsible Senate officers, including me, are constantly told at these times that bills which have been amended must be returned to the House of Representatives as quickly as possible. In this atmosphere it is surprising that more errors are not made, particularly with bills which are the subject of complex proceedings in the Senate. From now on I will be personally checking all bills and schedules of amendments returned to the House of Representatives with great care, and the return of the documents will be delayed for as long as is necessary for this to be done, notwithstanding that the House of Representatives is waiting for the documents. I consider that the system which is in place for the processing of bills and amendments is perfectly sound, and what is required to avoid future errors is greater care on the part of the officers involved and, as I have indicated, less regard for claims of extreme urgency.</PARA>

The Government, which is supposed to be a government to protect the rights of the workers, ought to hang its head in shame.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Putting all this aside, the net result of the Macklin amendment is that some legislation which is of great importance to the public is given very little debate through the whole Parliament. It is given virtually none in the House of Representatives. What debate did the Broadcasting Services Bill have in the House of Representatives? The Government had to get that legislation in here by a certain date. It was introduced in this chamber, but it had virtually no debate when it got to the other chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about other legislation that came from the House of Representatives? I took the opportunity of considering this at the time. For example, one of the health Bills had virtually no debate in the House of Representatives. When I say `no debate', I mean no real debate. Maybe half an hour or an hour was given to it. The matter then came to this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of other Bills like that one were rushed through the House of Representatives in order to meet the deadline so that they could be dumped on the table by the Government. When those Bills got here they were the subject of the guillotine in this chamber, thus denying full debate in the Senate. So there is a farcical situation in this Parliament when debate is denied in the House of Representatives because of the Macklin motion, the Government rushes legislation here, and then denies full debate in the Senate through the guillotine. That is an absolute disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appeal to those in the Democrats to reconsider this proposal and to consider very carefully whether they move the Macklin motion again. I will oppose it on the next occasion quite deliberately because I believe that ultimately it is a denial of democracy. That was not the intention of Michael Macklin. His intention was to enable the Senate to have Bills here so that we could properly consider them. But that intention is then negatived by the application of the guillotine here. As I said, the net result of that is that Bills do not get a fair hearing in either the House of Representatives or here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I again remind the Senate that on that Wednesday there were 161 amendments to legislation before this chamber. Given the time that both we and the officers had to spend in this chamber, is it little wonder that there was confusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator John Herron has just walked into the chamber. He had something to say about the issue of health as a result of the long hours of sitting. I encourage him to continue on that examination to expose the occupational hazards that occur when we are forced by the Government to sit here for long hours to consider measures deemed as urgent by the Government under the guillotine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only were the Clerks confused but also quite obviously we were confused. If someone was to ask me whether those amendments, which were referred to by Senator Alston, had been passed, I would not be able to say. Senator Alston made reference to them. He, the Opposition and the Government knew that the House of Representatives opposed them and that they therefore should not have been included. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This brings me to the constitutional issue. Is the intention of the Parliament not the real issue? We know that one of the aids used by the judiciary in the interpretation of the law is the intention of Parliament. The letter that I have just incorporated indicates what the Clerk thinks about this issue. It indicates that he sees no reason why a simple correction of the record should not be sufficient. I agree with him in that respect, with the proviso&mdash;and he probably had this proviso in mind&mdash;that if a member of the House of Representatives had bothered to look at the amendments when they came down at that late stage to the House of Representatives and had indicated that he or she had deliberately voted having read and considered the schedule of amendments that had come back from the Senate, then that simple amendment to the records would not then suffice. Clearly, that would not then reflect the intentions of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No such member of the House of Representatives has come forward and said, `Yes, I read the schedule of amendments that came from the Senate and voted accordingly'. I will guarantee that very few, or any, members read the amendments at all. Some decision was made somewhere around the place by the Government that it would agree with them, and that was it. What was wrong with the Government? Even the Government did not read the amendments. If officers of the Government read them, they would have said to the Government, `No, we will not agree with these four amendments'. Everybody realised the situation. I believe that the proposal put by Mr Evans, the Clerk, is reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are now faced with a motion to give retrospective effect to legislation. I will not support it. I am prepared to say, `Let the proposal put by the Clerk proceed'. In other words, let there be an amendment to the record which will reflect the intention of the Parliament, both the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Government would then get its measure in place from 1 July 1992. The Government is now proposing to move this amendment and, I believe, thus virtually reopen the whole issue to challenge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask through you, Mr President, that Senator McMullan table in this chamber the advice that the Government got in respect of this matter, the advice referred to in your statement, Mr President, that the Government was given. I would like the Minister to table that advice so that we can have a look at it. It has not been tabled and it should have been. That is the constitutional question that we are now faced with. I seriously believe that the Government is now opening up that measure to a legal challenge, at least as to the date of operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I come to the Opposition's amendment to the motion. Because I am not supporting the motion, I will not be supporting the amendment, although that does not necessarily follow on all occasions, of course. I notice that the amendment states:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it means that the Opposition is strongly opposed to the amendment that we made to the Industrial Relations Act, then I would agree, because we will regard the day that we agreed to that amendment as a very, very dark day for workers in this country. I did not agree to it; I voted against it. I think I was the only one in the whole of the Parliament, in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, to vote against that measure. I voted against the amendment to the Industrial Relations Act which required the Industrial Relations Commission to have regard to the amounts paid in superannuation when determining national wage cases. We and the workers of this country will rue the day that we ever passed that proposition. It undermines the integrity of the Industrial Relations Commission and builds into the system a situation where workers will increasingly not be able to form or raise a family on one income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At some stage I would like to debate the issue raised by Senator Alston and adverted to by Senator Reid. One of the things I am very concerned about is that the women who do the most important job of nurturing and raising Australia's future citizens have been discriminated against. They will continue to be discriminated against, unless something is done in respect of superannuation and there is a recognition of their status and the contribution they make to this nation. We all accept the moral and formative contribution that these women make, but I am also talking about their economic contribution.

I heard Senator McMullan say, `The difference between our systems on superannuation is that ours is compulsory and theirs is voluntary'. That is very true. That is an essential difference. Our policy is designed to make it attractive for people to provide for themselves in later life whereas this Government's is designed to penalise business, to regulate it out of existence. The whole of the Fightback package is designed to free it up, to take the burden and the impost of taxation on business off so they can employ more, so there can be more productivity and not the ludicrous concept of productivity that is served by the so-called accord. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The constitutional question has been canvassed and very eloquently dealt with by Senator Alston. The real question is that if we follow the route the Government is following today, simply because it is fearful of recommitting the Bill for a vote, the Government might lose the Democrats or the Democrats might do something which is unpredictable. It is frightened to death of recommitting the matter. If the Government did, it would put the matter beyond doubt. However, it is prepared to go this route, which means that the legislation may be subsequently held to be invalid and that the period from 1 July 1992 to today will be, to put it mildly, despite the protestations of Senator McMullan earlier, a deep grey area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find the Government's harsh and intolerable attitude to small business and individual families appalling. It does not care a damn what happens to those people who lose their jobs. There are around 40,000 to 70,000 people who could be affected. People will go towards Christmas without having a job; kids will not be enjoying the Christmas they have been used to. But all of this is irrelevant because we are on an ideological kick here. The Government says, `We must have compulsory superannuation', which will have the effect of a compulsory tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I simply say both to the Democrats and the Government that if they take heed of the words of Senator Alston's amendment they will see that they have erred; that the Government was unable to be in charge of its own legislation, with its highly paid galaxy of advisers, and unable to pick it up; and that the way the Government's legislative program is run is just about as good as the way it runs the economy&mdash;both downhill and into the ground. I would say to them: here is an opportunity. Why do you not take it and give Australia a break?</PARA>

Senator Bishop concluded her remarks by addressing the nature of the legislative program that the Government had put before this chamber. I want to concentrate particularly on that matter. Given the enormous burden the Government imposed on this chamber between 16 and 25 June when some 61 Bills were declared urgent and forced through this chamber, I suspect the issue is that it is probably not surprising that only one mistake was made. I suspect the real surprise is that not more mistakes were made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had the Senate Table Office pull out some figures to see how we can perhaps measure the performance of this Government in relation to the management of its legislative program by comparing it with other governments. At the end of my remarks I propose to seek leave to incorporate this table in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. I have cleared the incorporation of the table with Senator McMullan, who unfortunately is not in the chamber. This table shows that in fact the record of this Government in managing the legislative program is absolutely appalling. On no other occasion since 1970, for example, has any government attempted to put so many Bills through the Parliament, having declared them urgent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that between 1970 and 1972, the period of the McMahon Government, two Bills were declared urgent. In the seven years of the Fraser Government, some 57 Bills in all were declared urgent.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A fair assessment of the table which I will be seeking leave to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> will show that the management of the Government's program has been particularly bad. It will also show, regrettably, that that management seems to be getting progressively worse. Senator Harradine was quite correct in drawing our attention to the heavy responsibility that the Democrats must take in this. It would be impossible for the Government to pass a motion to declare its Bills urgent and to guillotine these Bills through the Senate, but for the agreement of the Australian Democrats who are prepared to support the Government in its motions to declare Bills urgent. That is a great pity&mdash;a number of my colleagues have drawn attention to this&mdash;and I want to draw out a couple of the reasons why I think it is a pity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Macklin motion, which was designed to encourage the Senate to more carefully review the legislation coming from the House of Representatives, is completely negated by the willingness of the Australian Democrats to agree to pass a motion to declare Bills urgent. The next time that Senator Coulter is asked to act with the Government on such a motion, I urge him to look very carefully at the table which I will be seeking to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> which shows the progressive decline in the capacity of the Government to manage its program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suspect there is something more insidious, however, in the sense that some public servants have come to the very sensible conclusion that, if they can hold Bills back until the last weeks of the session, those Bills can be rushed through the Parliament without any proper debate. It is well worth Senator McMullan and his colleagues looking very carefully at just what their departments are doing. Whereas I may deplore the fact that public servants may be acting in this manner, given the stresses and strains also placed on them, from some perspective at least, they may be regarded as acting in a rational manner in trying to get their Bills through the Parliament with the least possible fuss. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although I do not believe Senator Coulter has collectively conspired to achieve this goal, the Democrats continuing support, regardless, for the motion by the Government to declare Bills urgent does have this effect. I would ask Senator Coulter to carefully consider that matter the next time the Government seeks his support for such a motion. It is quite clear that, at least in some departments, Bills are being held back because departments know they can be rushed through the House of Representatives, where the Government has the numbers, and they can also be rushed through the Senate. I think that is a great pity. Also, the Ministers of the Government understand that if they can hold Bills back they can, regrettably, rely on the support of the Australian Democrats to agree to an urgency motion so that the Bills can be rushed through the Parliament without proper debate. </PARA>

I have here a document bearing the title, `In The Matter of Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Bill 1992', headed, `Opinion' and signed by the Solicitor-General, Mr Gavin Griffith, dated last Thursday, 13 August 1992, which poses a number of questions, deals with a consideration of those questions and, accordingly, answers them.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">OPINION</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After passage through the House of Representatives the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Bill 1992 ("the Bill") was amended in the Senate. Due to clerical error (in its root sense of meaning error by a clerk) the signed Schedule of Amendments ("Schedule") annexed to Message 491 24 June 1992 from the President of the Senate to the Speaker included some purported amendments which had not been passed in the Senate. The error was not exposed until after the House of Representatives had agreed to all the purported amendments in the Schedule before assent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The President has not yet sent a message to the Speaker to correct the error of Message 491. I am instructed that the Clerk of the Senate has expressed a personal view that whilst the error could have been corrected administratively before 1 July without further reference to either House, rectification now requires resolution by the Senate. This is because the commencement Clause 2 reads "This Act commences on 1 July 1992", a date now passed. The suggestion is that the Bill has therefore become a Bill for retrospective legislation, and effectively a new Bill, if brought into force in the form.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am asked&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Chapter 20 of the Senate Standing Orders regulates the passage of Bills through the Senate. Under S.O. 131, a Bill which has originated in the House of Representatives and been passed by the Senate with amendments is returned to the House by message from the President with the amendments set out in a schedule certified by the Clerk. However, S.O. 131 prescribes only a parliamentary procedure. It does not reflect any constitutional requirement to pass a law (cf. procedures under section 57 of the Constitution in respect of the enactment of legislation at a joint sitting). The correction or non-correction of Message 491 by further message from the President will not affect the efficacy of the completed passage of the Bill through the Senate. Constitutionally it is not a necessary pre-condition to the House reconsidering the Bill amended by the Senate that the schedule of amendments passed by the Senate be correctly, or even at all, transmitted with message under S.O. 131 from the President to the Speaker. What is required is that the proposed law be passed in the same terms in each House.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where, as here, a Bill originates in the House and is passed by the Senate, the courts will not ordinarily enquire whether the internal procedures of Parliament have been complied with. The High Court has expressed the view that it is for each House to determine whether a law has been passed by each House according to its procedures, and the assent is taken as indicating that the Bill has been passed by each House: see Victoria v. Commonwealth and Connor (PMA Case) (1975) 134 CLR 81, 181 Mason J. At 164, Gibbs J said the courts are not concerned with enforcement of Standing Orders of the two Houses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although there must be limits to the extent to which the High Court will foreclose consideration of parliamentary processes in constitutional litigation, it is unnecessary to consider issues of judicial review in resolving this matter of parliamentary process. Obviously, each House must rely upon the other to comply with its procedures, and it cannot be a proper working of the relationship for material formally communicated by one to the other to remain uncorrected after error is detected. Message 491 should have been formally corrected by a further message from the President to the Speaker as soon as the mistake was exposed, and no authority from the Senate was required before or after 1 July. The fact that a law proclaimed in the form passed by the Senate after 1 July will contain a commencement date in incorrect tense is irrelevant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 58 of the Constitution allows the Governor-General to assent to a proposed law only after it has been "passed by both Houses of the Parliament". The constitutional requirement is that the substantive text be passed in each House. Here different amendments have been passed. Section 58 has not been complied with. It follows that no present version of the proposed law may be presented for assent. There is no scope for a text to be finalised by administrative action to express the supposed will of the Parliament. As the proposed law has not been passed by both Houses it cannot be presented for assent, either in the form passed in the Senate or with the purported amendments agreed to by the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mechanism to ensure passing of the Bill in compliance with constitutional requirements is a separate issue from correction of the President's advice to the Speaker. The House of Representatives may now agree to the amendments as they were in fact passed by the Senate. It then should send a new message under its Standing Order 247 explaining that its earlier message under that Standing Order was ineffective insofar as it said that the House had agreed to the amendments that were not in fact made by the Senate and stating that it has now agreed to all the amendments made by the Senate. Then the same proposed law will have been agreed to, and so "passed" by both Houses. In that form, the Bill may be presented for assent under section 58. This can be done even if no correcting message is sent by the President of the Senate to the Speaker. No further consideration by the Senate is required. Nonetheless, as a matter of practice between the Houses, it is appropriate for the President to correct message 491 before the House of Representatives considers and agrees to the correct schedule of amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Upon assent, the commencement date is a matter of construction: see Worrall v. Commercial Banking Co of Sydney Ltd (1917) 24 CLR 28. The infelicity in the tense of clause 2 will be explained by legislative history. For the avoidance of doubt, this intention for retrospective operation could be expounded and explained in the Minister's speech when the correct amendments are agreed on the further consideration of the Bill in the House of Representatives. In the peculiar circumstances of the passage of this law, a court should find that the Act does have retrospective operation back to the originally intended prospective date of 1 July 1992. This may, in turn, give rise to some other arguments as to whether the purported retrospective operation of the Act back to 1 July is valid, but those arguments could arise even if Clause 2 was amended directly to provide for retrospective operation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The motion before the chamber can be best described as a motion to correct a technical defect that arose in the transmission of advice from this chamber to the House of Representatives. There is no argument, it seems, that what was determined by this chamber and what was later transmitted to the House of Representatives for its deliberation was different and a mistake was made. This debate is about a motion moved by the Government to enable that mistake to be corrected, and corrected in a way in which the appropriate respect for the Standing Orders and the procedures of the Parliament is given.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has occurred in this debate, certainly during the time of my presence on duty in this chamber, has been an effort&mdash;under the guise of an amendment to the motion proposed by the Government&mdash;to do a couple of things. The first is to redebate the issue in chief&mdash;to recanvass the merit of the original legislation, a matter that was debated and determined previously. That has resulted in a number of honourable senators in this place arguing matters that we are familiar with. They argued them before; we hear them again. None of their opinions are surprising. They were not persuasive when they were originally put and they ought not be persuasive now. But in any case, those opinions are beside the point of the matter which is before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to Senator Bishop that it is quite extraordinary to hold up as proof&mdash;in her terms&mdash;that this legislation has a deleterious economic effect, that the day after the Senate passed it, a small business person approached her and said, `As a consequence of the passage of this legislation, people have to be laid off'. The Bill had not been proclaimed, no effect was felt by anybody, but by a vote of the Senate there was this conjunction of events. That is a preposterous argument. It is one that defies logic. It cannot be sustained. I only mention it here as an example of the argument being put when merit has been canvassed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second category of debate that has occurred has been, in essence, to accuse the Government of poor management of the Parliament and to hold the Government responsible for the mistake that was made. The sub-arguments under this heading are that the Government had offended particularly by having a number of Bills, by majority vote in this chamber, declared urgent and then dealt with at the end of the last session, and that the Government has put forward too many Bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, when the motion that these Bills be declared urgent was moved, a debate was had in this chamber about the merits of that motion. The question was determined by a majority vote of the chamber, yet we see in this debate a number of the arguments put then being canvassed again. They were canvassed by Senator Kemp, who was the last speaker here and who has just left the chamber. Moreover, this is done in a self-righteous way as if the matter had not been determined, almost in a way which reflects on a vote of the Senate, and in a way that suggests that all innocence resides with the minority party that lost the vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that it is fair to say that what persuaded this chamber when that vote came before it was the fact that there were a lot of Bills and that the proceedings of this chamber had slowed to a walk. The passage of Bills was delayed. I think that it would also be fair to say that any independent person watching these developments could conclude that a filibuster was under way and that a deliberate slowing of the proceedings was engaged in by talking through everything so that the Government would not get its Bills through, as an Opposition tactic. That debate was held and determined. Whatever were the issues, at least those explanations should be made in view of the re-canvassing of those views. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is odd to allege that a government is too active, that we put too many Bills forward. We make no apology for being an activist government. But one of the honourable senators in this debate has accused us of having too many Bills. It is true&mdash;and I confess that we do work hard&mdash;that we have significant change to preside over, but we make no apology for doing those things, and, if the accusation is that we have been working excessively hard, I guess that we as a government stand accused of that and accept the responsibility. But we do not accept responsibility for working sloppily. Working hard and working sloppily are two different things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this debate there have also been two sub-debates. One is that the Australian Democrats are culpable. That is really ridiculous. It does not require answer and I do not propose to answer it now. The other debate is that Secretary McMullan and Minister Dawkins are somehow responsible for all of this. I am not going to get into the business of who is responsible or who is to blame; that is not a constructive debate. All of the people responsible have worked hard, under significant pressure, and they are all professionals who deserve the position to which they have been appointed or elected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But life is not without error and to presume that no-one  makes a mistake, no matter how professional, thorough or diligent individuals might be&mdash;whether they be appointed or elected&mdash;is, of course, to support a fallacy. We all make mistakes. And when we do, the most sensible thing is to remedy it in a professional manner. I do not want to get into the business of who is to blame. It is a useless debate and, in the end, it is an irresponsible debate, too. I do not want there to be any lingering doubt that the Government has some sort of concern about that. Errors do occur and the mark of responsibility is their being corrected properly and quickly. That is why this debate is on now, at the beginning of this session, straight after Question Time and the normal procedures introducing the session. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings me to the amendment that has been moved. I think there is little support for it, and so there should be. As I have said, it canvasses the issues again. I want to commend the motion that my colleague Senator McMullan, the Parliamentary Secretary, has put before this chamber. When all of the debate on superannuation in this country is over and when a bit of daylight has been shed on the passage of this legislation, its application and its effect in the community, I think certain conclusions will be revealed as truths. Firstly, superannuation, prior to the advent of our submissions in support of it before the Industrial Relations Commission and our legislative prescription, was something that went to white-collar workers but traditionally not to blue-collar workers, was something that went to people in public employment but not to people in private employment by and large, and was something that went to better paid employees but not to middle and low income employees. Superannuation will now be available to all people. That is a significant social justice measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Superannuation payment for all employees, rather than only for those who have a discretionary income enabling them to invest in it or those in some privileged position of employment, is a social right. It is a right in social justice that this Government stands for, and it is in stark contrast to the view of the Opposition: let the measure fall where it may. We think that everyone is entitled to it. It also means that people can retire with superannuation and with dignity, so that they are not just recipients of retirement pensions; they can retire on a better level of income. That is an appropriate measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second thing that can be said is that, if one looks at the ageing of the Australian community, it can be seen that the post-war baby boomers start to become retirees early next century. The ratio of wage and salary earners paying income tax to the number of people in retirement dramatically collapses so that fewer taxpayers support more retirees. The burden of taxation then has to be confronted: does the level of taxation increase to keep the benefits up or does the level of benefits come down? Every prudent government in the world has faced this fact and made provision before the event so that there will not be a problem in terms of meeting what is clearly a cost in the future and has determined that the cost burden must be shared in some way. I think that is a reasonable thing. As I say, all prudent governments in the world have confronted it. It is a big change in the Australian community and it is appropriate now. I think that, when people look back on this, they will see that that was a fair and reasonable measure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps we should have that as a side argument. The third thing that I think will be established by the passage of this legislation is that superannuation which is accumulated into funds as aggregate savings will add to the volume of savings in the economy. The rapid take-up of superannuation will mean a direct explosion in the level of savings in the economy. Further, since those funds will be administered by trustees with an obligation to the contributors, I believe that it will also mean a huge pool of potential investment in Australian industry that is Australian owned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I believe that we ought to encourage foreign investment in this economy, quite clearly, the more Australian ownership and penetration there is of foreign ownership in this economy the better. One of the reasons why there has been less investment, despite the improved profit share going to business as a factor share, is that there has been a tendency&mdash;up until 1987, at least&mdash;for business to engage in speculative gain rather than real wealth generation. So the profit share has been dissipated in share market trading, artificial increases in share prices, takeovers and so on&mdash;and not directed to wealth creation. This legislation will establish a pool of investment funds open to Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those three arguments, despite the difference it seems that I have with the distinguished Leader of the Australian Democrats in regard to one of the arguments, should be enough to defeat this amendment and establish it for what it is&mdash;a politically opportunist amendment to a technical motion rectifying a fault, an amendment which seeks to use the expediency of this motion to make what are, in the event, some fairly trite legal points. It is an amendment worthy of defeat and not of support. I commend to the chamber the motion moved by my colleague Senator McMullan. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am indebted to the chamber. The advice of the Solicitor-General, Dr Griffith, in relation to this matter is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the avoidance of doubt, this intention for retrospective operation could be expounded and explained in the Minister's speech when the correct amendments are agreed on the further consideration of the Bill in the House of Representatives. In the peculiar circumstances of the passage of this law, a court should find that the Act does have retrospective operation back to the originally intended prospective date of 1 July 1992. This may, in turn, give rise to some other arguments as to whether the purported retrospective operation of the Act back to 1 July is valid, but those arguments could arise even if Clause 2 was amended directly to provide for retrospective operation.</PARA>
<PARA>Accordingly, he answers the question `Would such enactment have effect from 1 July 1992?' by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Act should be held to have effect from that date.</PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me that that advice is couched in very careful and uncertain terms. What he is really saying is that, hopefully, it will be held to have effect from 1 July. But it is also very clear, reading between the lines, that he would recommend, if asked, that the normal procedure be followed, and that is that you expressly provide in the Bill that it shall have retrospective effect. I therefore ask whether the Government is prepared to obtain further legal advice on this point; otherwise, as I did say to Senator McMullan, there is a very real prospect that there will be employer groups and others who may wish to challenge the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that the last thing the Government wants is to find that ultimately the intention was not sufficiently explained in the Bill, which is where it would firstly need to be explained. To avoid all of that, the matter should be clarified at this stage. So I ask Senator Cook whether he is prepared to obtain advice that is in much clearer and more definite terms than that provided by the Solicitor-General. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The short answer to that question put to me by Senator Alston is no. I thank Senator Alston for being concerned, on the Government's behalf, about whether this legislation will survive an appeal if an action is taken against it. I appreciate the worry that Senator Alston has that the legislation that he has opposed may not survive that. He feels that we should take his advice as to his reading of the Solicitor-General's opinion and further seek advice on that point, but I do not think it is necessary. The Government is of the view that the advice that is now in the record supports its approach to this matter. I notice that Senator Alston has interpreted that by using phrases like `if you read between the lines' or `it appears that it is obvious that'&mdash;which suggest that Senator Alston is engaging in a subjective interpretation of what he thinks that advice means.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Solicitor-General is, after all, the senior law officer of the Commonwealth, handing advice to the Government. He is competent in plain English and expresses his view forthrightly. So I do not take the view that there is somehow a question here that might be engaged in if one were a student of English literature: what is the hidden meaning?  One ought to take the plain advice and the plain language and accept the plain word, which is what we do. For that reason, I do not wish on behalf of the Government to accept the offer made on the basis of Senator Alston's concern that we get our legislation right.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I wish to make a personal explanation. With great self-discipline, I shall not comment on the matters the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) raised in his speech. However, I heard him suggest that the Opposition had been filibustering and that that had something to do with why the program ran as late as it did. I personally regard that as a gross reflection. That was not the case. It was never suggested at a Whips' meeting that we were filibustering. If the Minister looks at the record of the last session, he will find that there were many days when we did not bring on matters of public importance because we recognised the program that we were faced with. There were some days after Question Time when we took notice of answers, but we did not take up the same amount of time we would have taken had we put down a matter of public importance.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;An incident at Parliament House on 12 August 1992, in which a four-wheel drive vehicle was driven through the main entrance of the building, has received a great deal of media attention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable senators may be aware a number of agencies are involved in providing security in the parliamentary precincts. The Speaker and I decided that an expert who was not attached to any of these agencies was required to provide an objective assessment of the incident and the Parliament's capacity to respond. We commissioned Mr Richard Dixon of the security division of Price Waterhouse Urwick to examine the incident and make an immediate interim report to us on the appropriate means to prevent a recurrence of such incidents. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Dixon, who is a retired commander of the Australian Federal Police, presented his report yesterday. A copy of the report has been made available to the party leaders and the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) on a confidential basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report finds that the actions of security staff in detaining the driver of the vehicle and evacuating the public from the building were proper and effective.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Dixon's report contains recommendations for the installation of temporary barriers at the entrances to the building. As honourable senators will be aware, the barriers are now in place.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report makes other recommendations in relation to the installation of more permanent barriers, the strengthening of building entrances, the management of security, the powers of attendants and emergency evacuation procedures.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the statement.</PARA>
<PARA>We live in a peaceful and law abiding country. It is often very difficult to recognise the risks that we face from irrational or extreme lawlessness in this country. Looking at our history in the immediate past, we have seen diplomatic staff assassinated, very ugly incidents this year at one of the embassies in Canberra and, going back a bit further, the Hilton Hotel bombing of over a decade ago. It is an act of prudence that you, Mr President, have followed on this occasion to review the security procedures at Parliament House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within this new Parliament House we have had people in the other place leaping off the balconies onto the floor area of the chamber. Recently we had this quite dramatic incident where someone drove a vehicle through the front through closed doors into the building itself. It is not being too dramatic to imagine that it could have been a terrorist group which could have driven two small vehicles into this place loaded with 500 pounds or half a tonne of high explosive. Had they chosen to do that to make a statement about the Parliament of Australia, they could have driven in through that front door, through the central hallway, through the doors into both chambers simultaneously at Question Time, detonated the load and removed all the senators and all the members in one fell swoop from Australia. Technically, that is not an impossible scenario. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the possibility of that happening is very remote, it is prudent that you, Mr President, do make an assessment as to what security procedures are in place here. As a member of the New Parliament House Construction Committee for many years, I am aware that security procedures in this building were a matter of some debate, and changes were made with respect to the old Parliament House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say that for quite some while I have not been satisfied with the security procedures in this building. In a general sense everyone coming into this building, other than a senator or member, has to have an identification card. There are two types of cards that are worn on the lapel: one that requires the visitor to be accompanied at all times and thereby restricted to certain public areas if he or she is not accompanied, and the other a general card. That might be the theory of it, but in practice there are often people walking around the offices of this building in areas where they should not be without any identifying card on them at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I happen to work in this building on many occasions after the Senate has risen. I could not count the number of times I have been in my office and, without any knock on the door, total strangers have burst in and said, `Oh, you are there' and then disappeared into the middle of the night. I have no idea who those people are&mdash;whether they are security people or people just having a look at what goes on in the building. But that is a very lax procedure in my judgment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also concerned about the non-sitting periods. We do have body-scan X-rays, metal detectors, that people entering the building are supposed to walk through and the same X-ray scanning machines that the Federal Airports Corporation has for hand baggage at all the airports. But it has been my observation that in the non-sitting periods those X-ray screening devices are not used and people come into the building carrying bags and they are never examined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be quite possible for someone to come in with a nefarious intent and to deposit any sort of device within the building on a non-sitting day, timed to detonate or combust days or weeks later. We do not seem to have any defence against that at all. The other element of security is that of theft. People could be taking things out of the building because there does not seem to be any exit check on people leaving the building, particularly in the non-sitting weeks. So I would hope that we have a thorough and objective review of the systems that are in place, Mr President. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further point of concern is that the Commonwealth Government does have some very well advised or well trained professional people. For example, we have them in ASIO, in the Federal Police and, I would have thought, in the Protective Services. I am interested in why we went to Price Waterhouse or to a group outside the Commonwealth for this advice. I should have thought there was enough advice available within Commonwealth agencies to provide you, Mr President, with the level of expertise and guidance that you needed on this issue, and probably at far less cost to the Parliament than going to a private consultant. Having had some experience of some of the agencies of the Commonwealth, I do not really believe that in this area there are private contractors who can match the resources that the Commonwealth has. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, this question of security is one that I have raised with you and others in Estimates committees over a number of years. I have raised and highlighted examples of where the security has been, quite frankly, inadequate. This was particularly so during the Gulf war, when it came to our attention that it was quite open for anyone to go into the garages under Parliament House where bombs could have been placed. There have been other examples of theft where thousands upon thousands of dollars worth of merchandise have simply walked out of this building. On all occasions, we simply got the answer that, really, our security is quite adequate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose one of the things that made me crosser than most was the party that the now Prime Minister (Mr Keating), then Treasurer, held in the private dining-room, where a Fred Williams painting was greatly harmed by the throwing of food and drink. When I insisted on getting a report from security officers, all they could manage to do was interview 12 people. They could find no culprit. Surprise, surprise, no action was ever taken and, if my memory serves me correctly, it was the Department of the Treasury that paid the bill for the restoration work that took place on the painting and not the then Treasurer, now Prime Minister, himself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, I echo the remarks of Senator MacGibbon when he says that he does not understand why you had to go to an outside consultant when we have access to the Protective Service which, as I understand it, is a sort of unlabelled version of the Federal Police. We pay a very heavy cost for the alleged security in this building and I can only say that, on the sorts of questions that I have asked you, Mr President, in Estimates prior to this time, I am really not surprised that we finally had a crisis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to know the truth or otherwise of the anecdotal story that the man driving the vehicle actually stalled between the two sets of doors and nobody was able to get him out of that vehicle at that time. I would like to know whether that is true or otherwise. Again, Mr President, when we come to the Estimates, I can say to you now we will be looking very much at whether we get value for money with the way the security is presently run. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I have just a couple of points as well on security in Parliament House. May I ask you how on earth any vehicle got from the front road to the front doors, in the first instance, without some security measure coming into place? What is happening with perimeter security? I always thought that there was some form of perimeter security to stop such a thing; that only formal cars for formal functions would be able to get up to that location.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was noted by a lady who came into this building at about one o'clock yesterday afternoon with photographic ID&mdash;there was no great problem with that&mdash;that there was no-one on duty at the side Senate door, and she was able to just waltz straight through the side Senate door without any check or verification. Given the events of last week, I think it is rather sad that something like that should happen less than one week later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also ask you what is the status of the new planter boxes&mdash;I suppose you would call them&mdash;at the side Senate door? They look like outsize coffins. I presume they have been put there for some security purpose. I wonder whether, in fact, that has been approved by such people as the Fire Department. It has always been a source of fascination to me that, given those two very narrow doors on the Senate side, in the event of this building catching fire and there being a stampede of people trying to leave, they would almost have to get into single file to exit in a most orderly fashion while their tails are burning.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Mr President, I ask you whether that has been checked from a fire point of view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also&mdash;not that I wish you to publicly disclose any further measures as to the sensitive nature of the security&mdash;are any other obstacles going to be built just for the purpose of stopping cars coming in when, in fact, it is quite clear that someone could have just walked up to the front door the other day and thrown something in, and that not necessarily being from a car?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In reply to some of the issues that have been raised, as far as Senator MacGibbon is concerned, as a member of the New and Permanent Parliament House Committee&mdash;and he knows that I was on it too&mdash;he would realise that previous governments downgraded security on the grounds of costs at various times when the issues were brought before the Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of identification cards is being addressed at the moment. I would like to point out that the rules on sitting days are the same as for non-sitting days, as far as coming into the building is concerned. That is what I have been advised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At least two senators raised the fact that we have the APS, the AFP, ASIO and other organisations carrying out security in this building. That is the very reason why the Speaker and I wanted somebody who was not associated with any of the agencies that give us advice on security in this building to do the first report for us&mdash;somebody who was at arm's length from the different agencies that give us advice at the moment. The advice that has been given to us is certainly on a temporary basis. It was a rush job, but something had to be done immediately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The planter boxes which are there were part of that report. There was a genuine concern about some sort of copycat attitude in that somebody might try to do the same thing. The advice was that that was the best thing that could be done on a temporary basis, and those planter boxes will not be there on a permanent basis. However, there is no doubt that the Speaker and I have to ensure that that sort of event does not happen again. As I have said, this is simply temporary, but we will look at a full ranging report on what we can do on a permanent basis to make sure that that type of incident does not happen again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bishop and, I think, Senator Knowles asked some questions that I am not able to give answers to at the moment. It is not that I do not want to, but I am not about to point out some of the deficiencies in the system that have been pointed out to us already. As a result of that, the confidential report that has been given to the Presiding Officers has also been given to the party leaders and the relevant Ministers and, hopefully, at some time in the future, we will be able to give more details. I can assure you, Senator Bishop, that during the Estimates committees you will be able to follow that line of questioning. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This instrument, upon which I reported on 26 May 1992, is defective because it appears to entrench an anomaly strongly criticised by the Merit Protection and Review Agency. However, following intervention by the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, the Department has reviewed its previous position that the anomaly need not be addressed and has subsequently proposed action which should resolve the present inequity.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">PUBLIC SERVICE DETERMINATION No.27 OF 1992</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 26 May 1992 the Committee reported to the Senate on its concerns with clause 11 of this Determination, which related to an anomaly which deprived certain officers of the Australian Public Service of credit for up to one week's recreation leave. That anomaly was investigated by the Merit Protection and Review Agency, which reported that the position was "clearly . . . inequitable", "obviously anomalous", "unfair and inequitable" and required legislative or other action to mitigate its past and future consequences. However, the present Determination not only did not correct the anomaly but also may have entrenched it. Also, the MPRA advised the Committee that it was not informed that the Determination would be made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After that report to the Senate the Committee was briefed by a member of the senior management groups of the Department of Industrial Relations and two other members of the Department, who also prepared two papers for the Committee. The result of these discussions was that the Department expressed a preferred option to deal with the problem through direct appropriation during the present budget process, rather than by legislative action. The Committee advised that it would be satisfied if the matter was dealt with in this way.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The outcome of the Committee's scrutiny of this instrument is encouraging. We have not yet received confirmation that the money will be available. However, the position now is that whereas previously the Department informed the MPRA and those affected that the anomaly would not be addressed, following the intervention of the Committee the official stance of the Department is that action should be taken.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is grateful to the Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator the Hon Peter Cook, for his assistance. The Minister instructed the Department to cooperate with the Committee in its investigation and, on being advised that the Committee would be satisfied with particular action, wrote to the Prime Minister requesting this action. This action by the Minister demonstrates a commitment to the principles of the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee will report again to the Senate when we receive further advice. The Committee still has a notice of motion of disallowance on Public Service Determination 1992/46, which amends substantive provisions of clause 11 of Public Service Determination 1992/27 to correct drafting oversights.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The correspondence of the Committee in this matter is set out below:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to Public Service Determination 1992/27, considered by the Committee at its meeting of 7 May 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I attach a copy of a representation about the Determination from Mr Graham Boucher. The Committee would appreciate your comments on the representation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On its face, the representation raises serious issues. The copy of the Merit Protection and Review Agency report in respect of this matter stated that the existing position was "clearly. . . inequitable" and that the legislation was "obviously anomalous" and required amendment. The MPRA recommended that in view of the "unfair and inequitable" application of the legislation that Mr Boucher should be compensated and that other action should be taken. It now appears that the Department may have expressly made delegated legislation which fails to implement the thrust of the recommendations. If this is so then the Committee would be disturbed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also has several concerns about the instrument itself. Firstly, subclause 11.1 appears to interpret the words of s.68A of the Act in a particular way. We would be grateful for confirmation that this is legally possible. In this context the Explanatory Statement advised the statutory authority for subclause 11.2. Next, the Explanatory Statement does not appear to tell the whole story, if that story is as related by Mr Boucher and the MPRA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The broader issues raised by this Determination are also serious. Numbers of Public Service Determinations grant discretions to decision makers. In the past the Committee has raised the question of merit review of these discretions. The answer we have received is that merit review is available under the grievance procedures of the Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act 1984. For instance, see our correspondence on Public Service Determinations 1990/11, 1990/12, 1991/37 and 1991/39. A letter to the Committee of 22 July 1991 concerning Public Service Determination 1991/39 stated that the "regulations provide for internal review and for review by the Merit Protection and Review Agency of adverse decisions. . . The regulations are shortly to be amended. . . to ensure that the rights of officers and employees are protected". The Committee accepted these assurances and consequently refrained from raising other discretions. It is disturbing, to say the least, that the Department may apparently ignore a recommendation of the MPRA in this way.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the serious nature of this matter we would be grateful if the subdelegate in the Department who made the Determination, and other suitable officers, could brief the Committee at its next meeting at 8.30 am on 28 May 1992 in Senate Committee Room 1S6. The Department should contact the Committee secretary on 277 3066 to confirm this.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee would also appreciate your comments on the above issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to preserve the options of the Committee I will give a notice of motion of disallowance in respect of the relevant clause of the Determination on the next sitting day.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 27 May 1992 on aspects raised by the Committee of Public Service Determination 1992/27.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Officers of your Department have since then assisted the Committee by appearing before it to speak to a paper and, after that meeting, by preparing another paper. The Committee considered that second paper at its meeting of 18 June 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department's second paper covered various courses of action available in this matter. Under the heading "Conclusion" the paper advised that "the preferred option" is to deal with this problem by direct appropriation "through the current budget process". This confirms earlier advice in the paper that these arrangements "could be achieved in the 1992/93 budgetary process". The Department also advised, in a covering letter, that the paper would be the basis of a submission to you.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee would be completely satisfied if the matter was dealt with under the Department's preferred option. However, the Committee considers that another appropriate solution would be to amend the parent Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee emphasises its view that the present position for relevant officers, characterised by the Merit Protection and Review Agency as unfair and inequitable and the existence of which has been known for almost 20 years by the administering authorities, should be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee would be grateful for your advice on proposed action on the Department's preferred option. It would be appreciated if this could be received by, say, the end of July, to enable the Committee to finalise its consideration of this matter by the start of the Budget sitting. Given that the preferred option is to operate in the context of the 1992/93 budgetary process we do not suppose that this will cause any difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also noted that Public Service Determination 1992/46 replaced the substantive provisions of subclause 11.1 of Public Service Determination 1992/27. Your Department advised that this was because "it was realised that subclause 11.1 did not have the intended effect". In order to preserve the options of the Committee I will give a notice of disallowance on this second Determination during the next sitting week.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) is delivering in another place his Budget Speech for 1992-93.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>It is my privilege to outline to the Senate the Budget proposals of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, this Budget has three fundamental objectives. </PARA>
<PARA>The first two are about jobs:  jobs now, and more jobs in the years ahead. </PARA>
<PARA>When, as is the situation now, there are not enough jobs, it is up to the Government to take action; to do everything in its power to provide jobs for those Australians without employment. </PARA>
<PARA>We have already taken initiatives to boost the economy and rebuild and modernise the nation's transport system. </PARA>
<PARA>We have vastly expanded opportunities for young Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>And tonight, as our first priority, the Treasurer is announcing further measures to boost employment in those communities and regions hardest hit in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA>Many of our fellow Australians have, for the first time, found themselves out of work. </PARA>
<PARA>For them we cannot simply wait and hope, or engage in some economic experiment. </PARA>
<PARA>We must act now, in ways which we know will work. </PARA>
<PARA>These employment measures will include projects conceived at the local level, providing real work and, at the same time, enhancing facilities for many deprived communities. </PARA>
<PARA>The total cost will be $1.2 billion over two years. </PARA>
<PARA>This attack on unemployment is part of our second objective&mdash;the implementation of a comprehensive and continuing strategy which is designed to achieve around 800,000 new jobs over the next four years. </PARA>
<PARA>Crucial to this strategy is the maintenance of a resolve to create a dynamic and successful trading nation: a nation based on talent, ideas and innovation, with its industry employing skilled workers producing goods and services to sell here and overseas. </PARA>
<PARA>This resolve will be fortified by measures announced tonight to entrench an already impressive growth in research and development and in exports. </PARA>
<PARA>There are new initiatives in vocational training, and there is increased effort to cut the costs of Government services and improve competition. </PARA>
<PARA>Our objective is to have new industries alongside the old, striving to secure a larger slice of the world market. </PARA>
<PARA>But this Budget&mdash;as its third objective&mdash;also confirms this Government as a caring Government, intent on pursuing its program of social reform. </PARA>
<PARA>Tonight I announce a major enhancement of Medicare, increased support for the aged and those who care for them, and for the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA>There are new measures to improve access to more secure housing, and there is more assistance for families. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">AUSTRALIA IN THE WORLD ECONOMY</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, as a small nation our future depends on taking advantage of developments abroad.</PARA>
<PARA>And in our case we straddle two very different parts of the world. </PARA>
<PARA>First there is the industrialised world of Europe and North America. These countries have also been struggling with high levels of unemployment. But they have higher inflation than we have. And many have lower growth prospects. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia's inflation rate is around 2 per cent, about half that of Europe. </PARA>
<PARA>This year the Government expects the Australian economy to grow by 3 per cent, or around a third faster than Europe. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia is also part of Asia. Growth rates and productivity in many Asian countries are impressive. But some have inflation close to 10 per cent. Most have inflation more than double that of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>With a foot in each hemisphere we can benefit from opportunities in both. </PARA>
<PARA>We can enjoy higher growth than is forecast for Europe and the USA, with inflation no higher. </PARA>
<PARA>Our growth rate will be closer to Asia's, but it will come without Asia's higher inflation. </PARA>
<PARA>And as we commit ourselves to best practice at home, and embrace competition abroad, neither hemisphere will constrain our growth. </PARA>
<PARA>But these opportunities will not be handed to us on a plate. </PARA>
<PARA>We must seize them. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">ADDRESSING THE UNEMPLOYMENT PROBLEM</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Last year was difficult for many countries. It was particularly difficult for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Recovery started during the year, but failed to gather strength in the way expected. </PARA>
<PARA>We all deeply regret that the growth achieved was not sufficient to prevent rising unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>We all deeply regret the cost of unemployment to individuals, to families and to the community. </PARA>
<PARA>But regret, without action, has a hollow ring to it. </PARA>
<PARA>Nearly 50 years ago, the Labor Government of John Curtin, in its famous White Paper, committed the Commonwealth to a policy of full employment. </PARA>
<PARA>This Government affirms that full employment must and will be our continuing goal. </PARA>
<PARA>Tonight the Treasurer is presenting a statement titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working for the Future</EMPHASIS> which sets out this Government's plans for the years ahead. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Budgetary Stimulus</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>The Budget has a firm and unequivocal role to play in  boosting economic activity in the short term. </PARA>
<PARA>It does so by providing a strong but temporary stimulus, and by ensuring that Australia emerges into sustained growth, with an enhanced economic infrastructure, better able to underpin the opportunities of the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA>Overall, the outlays cost of new and previously announced measures to boost the economy will be around $4 1/2 billion in the next two years. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition, we allow the impact of the recession on the Budget to run its course. </PARA>
<PARA>As a result, the budget deficit in 1992-93 is estimated to be $13.4 billion. </PARA>
<PARA>Nearly ten years ago this Government acted in the 1983 Budget to boost the economy and reduce unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>One and a half million new jobs were created and within four years the Budget recorded a surplus&mdash;the first in nearly four decades. </PARA>
<PARA>The present recovery will deliver jobs. But the Government is acting now to reduce unemployment more quickly, to ease the pain and burden on Australians and their families. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Employment Package</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Tonight I announce the expenditure of a further $742 million this year, and another $467 million next year, to attack unemployment at its roots&mdash;in the communities where the despair is deepest, where the pain hurts most. </PARA>
<PARA>The package builds on the offer from local government&mdash;the sphere of government closest to the community&mdash;to move rapidly to expand local employment opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA>This package for local government involves job placement, road building and repair, and a new local capital works program, together with the Landcare projects recently announced. </PARA>
<PARA>Its centrepiece will be the local capital works program which will inject $345 million into 411 local government councils, where about 70 per cent of all unemployed people live. </PARA>
<PARA>The program will involve grants of between $4 million and $20 million for each of 23 regions hardest hit by unemployment. These regions cover 179 local councils. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition, some $5 million is to be provided to local government, through their State Associations, to strengthen their capacity to co-ordinate the provision of regional infrastructure and regional economic development. </PARA>
<PARA>This measure recognises that local government has a key role to play in the process of national economic recovery and economic adjustment. </PARA>
<PARA>There will be $60 million for roads, and $154 million to be spent on government and non-government schools and universities. </PARA>
<PARA>$188 million planned for expenditure on urban development and public housing will be brought forward and spent this year and next. </PARA>
<PARA>Expenditures on Defence purchases and housing of $87 million will similarly be advanced to this year. </PARA>
<PARA>These measures will also be focused in regions with high unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>Labour market and training programs will be expanded, particularly to assist long-term unemployed adults and to improve workforce skills and labour market flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA>.Places under the JOBSTART program this year will almost double, to 104,000. </PARA>
<PARA>.Work experience and training under the JOBSKILLS program will be available for an additional 12,000 people over the next two years. </PARA>
<PARA>.An extra $92 million will be provided over three years for adult training places to help people back into jobs. </PARA>
<PARA>.Over the next four years, we will provide English language training to 38,000 job seekers.</PARA>
<PARA>In all, we will nearly double expenditure on these programs this year, to $1.1 billion, and assist over 420,000 people. </PARA>
<PARA>The combined effects of these measures will see unemployment decline from 11 per cent last June to below 10 per cent twelve months from now, and keep on declining in the years ahead. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">MAINTAINING AND ENCOURAGING ECONOMIC TRANSITION</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, reducing unemployment is our most pressing objective. But we must also continue our confident resolve to build a more export-oriented nation. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian economy is part way through a momentous period of transition. </PARA>
<PARA>We have derived enormous benefits from our abundant natural resources and will continue to do so. </PARA>
<PARA>But in a highly competitive world, we must increasingly turn to the even more potent talents of our people. </PARA>
<PARA>We are creating new strengths and new skills as we respond to changes in the world around us. </PARA>
<PARA>In five years, our manufactured exports have more than doubled, while exports of services have increased by 82 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>This has been an outstanding achievement. Our record on manufactured exports surpasses that of the major developed countries and even the Asian tigers. </PARA>
<PARA>There are many impressive examples. </PARA>
<PARA>Mitsubishi has centred its world production of the Magna Wagon in Adelaide. Ford is exporting its Capri, and Toyota plans to export 30,000 vehicles a year from its new plant in Victoria. Already, car industry exports exceed $l billion a year. </PARA>
<PARA>And Australian firms are exporting office equipment, chemicals, textiles, computers, telecommunication equipment and waste management technology. </PARA>
<PARA>There are about one hundred Australian firms exporting medical and scientific equipment. </PARA>
<PARA>Exports of services are also booming. Tourism is an important and well known example. But there are others. Australia's universities, schools and colleges earn $1 billion from overseas each year. </PARA>
<PARA>Australian engineers and accountants, business consultants and architects are building a valuable offshore client base. And exports of medical services to overseas patients in Australia are growing from a small base. </PARA>
<PARA>Currently, around 60 per cent of our exports go to Asia. For some time, Japan has been our largest export market. But Korea is now our third and Singapore our fourth largest market. </PARA>

<PARA>But we need to increase our total share of the world market, if our growth is not to be constrained by the subdued international outlook. </PARA>
<PARA>This Budget adds to new measures announced in February, to enhance the capacity of our industries to export. </PARA>
<PARA>$75 million will be provided over three years from 1993-94 to those established and successful exporters entering new markets. </PARA>
<PARA>And a new working capital guarantee facility will support approximately $300 million of new exports for firms short of working capital. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government is also to assist further the rural sector which has been badly affected by reduced world prices and severe drought. </PARA>
<PARA>Additional funds will be provided for rural adjustment and a National Drought Policy, and improvements will be made to the Income Equalisation Deposits Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>We are reducing the costs facing all exporters, our farmers, miners and manufacturers. And we are working with the States to improve the interstate rail freight and electricity industries. </PARA>
<PARA>With the States, we are reviewing their vital water supply industry and their shipping ports, and there is more to come. </PARA>
<PARA>We have given the Industry Commission a new role to identify impediments restricting the growth of promising export industries. The Treasurer is announcing the first group of ten references tonight. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, the capacity of our industries to compete depends on our ability to develop innovative products and more efficient production methods. </PARA>
<PARA>We have decided to extend indefinitely the 150 per cent  research and development tax concession, so that Australia can continue to grow as one of the world's research and development centres. We have also decided to tighten up the scheme to ensure that research benefiting from tax concessions has an appropriate commercial focus. </PARA>
<PARA>And our great scientific institutions, such as CSIRO, will receive $31 million over two years to continue building the research capacity so necessary for the challenge ahead. </PARA>
<PARA>Innovation springs from the arts as well as science. The Budget continues support of the film industry and increases support to the performing arts. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Economic Growth and the Environment</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>While the Government is actively encouraging the development of industry, this will be consistent with the preservation of the Australian and global environment. </PARA>
<PARA>We are allocating $107 million over the next four years to industry and environment programs to foster sustainable development and to help address climate change issues. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government's initiatives will integrate economic and environmental decision-making. </PARA>
<PARA>We will improve the taxation treatment of investment for, and spending on, pollution control. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Training and Workforce Skills</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Our capacity to compete in the world, and to enjoy challenging jobs, depends greatly on the skills of our workforce. </PARA>
<PARA>The creation of a new Australian National Training Authority and the injection of $720 million by the Commonwealth will see, in three years, over 100,000 more young Australians involved in vocational training. </PARA>
<PARA>And by the year 2000, we will have another 200,000 young Australians aged between 15 and 19 years at school, in college and at university. </PARA>
<PARA>To meet these increasing demands, the employment package I am announcing includes $60 million to help the States refurbish up to 600 of their older high schools. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Access to Education</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>In higher education, the Government will establish the Open Learning Program at a cost of $53 million over the next three years. </PARA>
<PARA>The program will draw on the remarkably successful but much smaller pilot project which started this year. </PARA>
<PARA>For Australians in remote communities, for those with family or work commitments, and indeed for any Australian who may not have enjoyed access to traditional higher education, this initiative will be a historic milestone in removing barriers to participation. </PARA>
<PARA>In short, every Australian with access to a television and a letter box can now have access to a university education. </PARA>
<PARA>Existing AUSTUDY arrangements will be improved, and the system of grants will remain intact. </PARA>
<PARA>Tertiary AUSTUDY students will have the option to supplement their benefits through a voluntary loans scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>Through all the improvements, about 43,000 additional students will be eligible for assistance. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Wages Policy</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, the co-operative development of a flexible wages policy is a key element in this Government's economic strategy. </PARA>
<PARA>Through its close relationship with the trade union movement, this Government has fundamentally altered Australia's wage setting arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>Workplace bargaining, which links wage increases to skills formation and productivity improvement, will become the primary mechanism for wage adjustments. </PARA>
<PARA>Agreements between managers and workers on matters such as hours of work, penalty rates, work practices and wage rates have improved flexibility while protecting basic conditions.</PARA>
<PARA>Building on this approach, the Government has proposed an  alternative to a National Wage Case. </PARA>
<PARA>Our proposal is that minimum award rates be adjusted through supplementary payments, by an amount of $10 a week, and that workplace bargaining be the principal vehicle for wage increases in the future. </PARA>
<PARA>This will protect low paid workers while encouraging employers and employees to accelerate productivity gains. </PARA>
<PARA>This will occur in a framework of maintaining Australia's inflation rate at or below that of our major trading partners and matching international best practice. </PARA>
<PARA>In the 1990s, as in the 1980s, the Accord between the Government and the trade union movement will ensure that we achieve significant improvements to the economy. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">SOCIAL REFORM</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>This Budget is a budget of action on jobs. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a budget of confident resolve to continue the transition to a modern, vibrant economy. </PARA>
<PARA>But it remains a budget of care;  care for our aged, for the frail, and for the disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA>In this Budget the Government is building on its proud record of social reform. </PARA>
<PARA>The cost of the initiatives to which I now refer have been offset, over this and the forward estimates years, by program savings and by revenue measures. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Medicare</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Important among the changes are the Medicare reforms which the Deputy Prime Minister will announce tonight. They will guarantee that every Australian will have access to the full range of Hospital and Medical Services on a fair basis. </PARA>
<PARA>An additional $1.6 billion will be provided over six years for public hospitals, subject to the States and Territories agreeing to the Government's proposals for the strengthening of Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA>These proposals ensure that Australians will have hospital services provided on the basis of clinical need and not on the basis of private health cover. </PARA>
<PARA>No longer will private patients be able to jump the queue ahead of public patients in equal need of treatment. </PARA>
<PARA>A program, costing $71 million over two years, will ensure that waiting times for elective surgery are brought down to acceptable levels. Strategies to achieve this will include, where necessary, buying in services from the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government's reforms will ensure that Medicare can meet the 29 per cent increase in public hospital admissions expected over the next decade. </PARA>
<PARA>To fund these substantial improvements in health services, the Medicare levy will increase by 0.15 per cent from 1 July 1993. </PARA>
<PARA>Australians on average weekly earnings will pay about 80 cents extra a week in their Medicare levy. For this they will receive the benefits of&mdash;and improvements to&mdash;one of the best health care services in the world. This achievement is one of which this Government and all Australians can be justly proud. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Support for Pensioners and Allowees</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>In February 1991 the Government gave a commitment to provide a real increase in pensions during the life of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>I am now announcing an increase in the single rate of pension of $6 a fortnight, and $10 a fortnight for pensioner couples, from late January 1993. </PARA>
<PARA>This increase incorporates the adjustment otherwise due in March 1993 and includes an additional amount. </PARA>
<PARA>This additional amount will be provided to the older, long-term unemployed, and to most of the unemployed with dependants. </PARA>
<PARA>From April 1993, all full and part pensioners and older long-term allowees will be eligible to receive the range of fringe benefits provided by the Commonwealth, including hearing aids and a telephone allowance. </PARA>
<PARA>$44 million will be provided for nursing homes over the next four years and a home equity loan scheme will be established for pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Housing</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, the Deputy Prime Minister will also be announcing tonight a new long-term housing strategy. </PARA>
<PARA>One of the first steps in the strategy will be to provide an extra $24 million in 1992-93, rising to $40 million in 1995-96, for rental housing managed by community organisations and local government. </PARA>
<PARA>$48 million will be provided over three years to help 20,000 lower income earners buy equity in the public housing in which they live. This will also release capital to fund new homes for those in need. </PARA>
<PARA>And a new structure of rent assistance, to cost $71 million next year, will benefit 440,000 low-income private renters, including about 300,000 pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Children</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>The Government will introduce a package to improve the affordability and efficiency of child care services. </PARA>
<PARA>It includes an increase in the existing fee relief ceiling of $4 a week for each child in care. And it will provide for continued operational subsidies to community-based child care centres and family day care services. </PARA>
<PARA>These measures will assist 135,000 families and will cost $68 million over the next four years. </PARA>
<PARA>In a new initiative, up to $136.50 in family allowance will be available on request as a lump-sum advance to help meet unforeseen expenses. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Disabilities/Carers</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>In 1990, the Government initiated measures to assist people with disabilities to enter the workforce and to participate fully in the community. </PARA>
<PARA>Tonight we are announcing further measures at a cost of $68 million over four years which will build on those reforms. </PARA>
<PARA>Additional funding of $41 million over four years will be provided for respite services to reduce the burden on carers of frail aged and disabled people. </PARA>
<PARA>And the domiciliary nursing care benefit is to be increased to $26 a week from 6 January 1993 and indexed thereafter. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Aboriginal Australians</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>The Budget provides for the policies and programs to assist Aboriginal people which the Prime Minister recently announced. It also provides a total of $19 million over four years for the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Remote Areas</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Australians living in remote areas are often disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA>The Government has thus decided to increase the income tax remote area zone rebates by 25 per cent from 1 January 1993. For people in the remotest areas of Australia, the base component will be $235 higher in a full year. Remote Area Allowances will be increased accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">REVENUE</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>I now turn to revenue measures. </PARA>
<PARA>The major revenue initiatives include the increase in the Medicare levy and an increase of $5 a kilogram in tobacco excise. </PARA>
<PARA>This increase will raise the price of a packet of 30 cigarettes by up to 20 cents and reinforces our policies to reduce the health costs of smoking. It will raise $80 million this year. </PARA>
<PARA>As part of the continuing task of making the tax system fairer, from 1 April 1993, Fringe Benefits Tax will be applied to valuable car parking facilities&mdash;mainly in central business districts&mdash;that are provided by employers to their employees. </PARA>
<PARA>Also, the tax benefits of limited partnerships will be restricted by taxing them on the same basis as companies. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">ECONOMIC PROSPECTS</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>The Budget has been framed with a realistic appreciation of the difficulties before us. </PARA>
<PARA>While net borrowing by the public sector is expected to be the same as last year, the Budget deficit will represent an estimated 3.3 per cent of gross domestic product. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government will eliminate the deficit as soon as possible. We shall introduce our announced personal income tax cuts. And the budget deficit will fall as economic recovery strengthens.</PARA>
<PARA>Outlays will fall over the period to 1995-96. But in the absence of new measures, revenues are also likely to decline. </PARA>
<PARA>If the fiscal position nearer to the time is not stronger than is now projected, the Government will consider and implement a number of tax changes to maintain the revenue structure. These changes&mdash;referred to in the Budget Statements&mdash;would allow for the 1995-96 deficit to be between  1/2 per cent and 1 per cent of gross domestic product. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia will grow more quickly this year than last. Australia is once again on the move. </PARA>
<PARA>Output is forecast to increase by $22 billion in 1992-93, creating around 160,000 jobs. </PARA>
<PARA>Recovery this year will continue to be aided by growth in private consumption, in housing and in public sector investment. </PARA>
<PARA>And business investment in plant and equipment, which is crucial to long-term job growth, is expected to turn around during 1992-93, making a modest contribution to the recovery. </PARA>
<PARA>Low inflation will continue to be the top priority of monetary policy. </PARA>
<PARA>Low inflation will take pressure off interest rates and thereby keep low the cost of borrowing to firms and families. </PARA>
<PARA>Low inflation will fortify our competitive position and so spur economic and employment growth. </PARA>
<PARA>The current account deficit is forecast to widen to 3 3/4 per cent of gross domestic product, in part owing to investment growth. This is below the levels experienced in earlier years, due in no small part to our impressive export performance. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">CONCLUSION</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Over the past decade, this Government has progressively reformed the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA>We are working to see our manufacturing and service sectors emulate the great record of our mining and rural industries by becoming dynamic and outward looking. </PARA>
<PARA>This Government also saw that our education system had to be reformed:  from the school system through to universities. </PARA>
<PARA>With that reform, young Australians can acquire the skills necessary for the challenging jobs of the future. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has reformed the capacity of the public sector to support the process of economic and social transition. </PARA>
<PARA>Much has already been achieved. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia, our companies and all working men and women are now better able to seize the opportunities offered by a changing world. </PARA>
<PARA>We need only the resolve to seize those opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA>This Budget shows that resolve. </PARA>
<PARA>But that resolve must continue to be matched by our care for those in the community who will not immediately benefit from those economic opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA>This Budget demonstrates that care. </PARA>
<PARA>And while Australia is better placed for future growth as the world economy recovers, we are determined to take action to provide jobs, by using all the means at our disposal. </PARA>
<PARA>This Budget takes that action. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The matter of public importance proposed by me on behalf of the coalition today reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need for the Government to present clear and objective forecasts and estimates in its 1992 Budget, free from political interference and manipulation.</PARA>
<PARA>I think it is quite clear from the wording of that MPI that the words were framed in anticipation of the Budget and that it would be a relevant debate prior to the Budget being introduced. Because of the delays in our procedures today, we had not reached the MPI by the time the Budget was introduced. It is inappropriate, therefore, now to proceed with the MPI in its existing wording. That is the reason why I have sought leave to withdraw the matter for discussion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In doing so, I wish to make a couple of points. The first one is that the main reason for the delay today in our proceedings in the Senate is the Government's incompetence in its handling of the matters pertaining to the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Bill 1992. Had that been handled with the competence that one would have expected in this place, those delays would not have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point I want to make is that the withdrawal of the MPI in no way reflects any backing away from the coalition's concern about the Government's political interference in and manipulation of economic forecasts and estimates. It is a customary practice now. It has been a highlight of this Government's performance in the last few Budgets and economic statements, notably the One Nation statement of February this year, that there has been very serious interference and involvement by the officers&mdash;particularly of the office of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and office of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins)&mdash;in the formulation of economic forecasts and estimates. It is a matter of great concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will be examining the Budget delivered tonight very carefully indeed to see whether that iniquitous practice has been pursued on this occasion. The Budget that we have seen produced tonight is a Budget full of `spend now, pay later' elements and the figures in the Budget depend very importantly on the parameters that have been put down as underpinning the Budget and the economic climate. It is those parameters that we have always expressed concern about, particularly in recent years. They are the parameters that have caused great difficulty and great concern. They are the subject of political manipulation and interference. The debate we were going to have today will take place, but in an updated form in the context of the consideration of the Budget. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>On 22 July 1992, the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs presented to the President a final report on its inquiry into a national drought policy and, in particular, appropriate Government responses to the recommendations of the 1990 report of the Drought Policy Review Task Force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee commenced this inquiry in January this year, when many areas in Australia were in drought. Although recognising the importance of receiving evidence from governments and other organisations, the Committee wanted to listen to the views of those most affected by drought, that is, ordinary farmers and their families in rural Australia, and to draw on their current experience of drought. Over 170 witnesses appeared before the Committee at 17 public hearings, most of which were convened in rural and regional centres across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee's report, as its title suggests, focuses on measures which should be taken by the Commonwealth Government to encourage a self-reliant, risk management approach to drought by primary producers. The Committee reiterated the view expressed in its interim report that a national drought policy should encourage a self-reliant approach to drought. The policy should also ensure adequate maintenance and protection of livestock and other resources, facilitate the early recovery of agricultural and rural industries from drought and minimise the loss of valuable international markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, the Committee considered that appropriate financial incentives must be provided to farmers to store funds, fodder and water. Financial reserves, or what was described in evidence as a `haystack of funds', provide a sound basis for drought proofing. At the same time, the Committee recognised that these financial incentives must not be open to abuse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its report, the Committee makes precise and practical recommendations about specific improvements to the income equalisation deposit scheme in order to make it more effective and attractive to farmers; the extension of full tax deductibility in the same year for expenditure on drought proofing measures, such as structures to conserve or convey water; and the introduction of tax credits for expenditure on drought proofing measures. It is not much good to give tax assistance to people who are making a loss. It is necessary, over a period of years, to give them an opportunity by providing them with tax credits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although endorsing a self-reliant approach to drought, the Committee considered that there are limits to the capacity of farmers to cope with severe drought. Invariably, as drought worsens, self-reliance will diminish and, even with sound management and planning, it may be difficult for a primary producer to withstand the effects of the most severe drought. In some cases it would be impossible. The Committee's report provides detail about the difficulties in defining `severe drought' and appropriate mechanisms to trigger additional assistance in times of severe drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, the Committee came to the view that the Commonwealth Government has a responsibility to provide additional assistance in severe drought. It is also in the interest of the Commonwealth Government to do so. It is in the national interest for the Commonwealth Government to protect and maintain Australia's agricultural base and productive capacity and, in particular, its breeding herd and flock. Once lost, it is almost impossible to regain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Chairman of the Committee, I welcome the recent announcement by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) that the Commonwealth will provide new extreme drought assistance of $14m to New South Wales and Queensland. Both these States have large regions which have been affected by severe drought for up to three years. They are still being affected by severe drought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee received considerable evidence about the rural adjustment scheme as a delivery mechanism for Commonwealth assistance during drought. The Committee's report identifies several problem areas, including additional debt burdens and eligibility criteria. As Chairman of the Committee, I welcome the recent announcement by the Minister that the Commonwealth and States have agreed to major reform of the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the first major inquiry and report by the newly established Rural and Regional Committee. During the inquiry, the Committee adopted various procedures that allowed&mdash;and encouraged&mdash;as many people as possible to have a say. For example, in Cobar, New South Wales, 12 people came from the audience to tell the Committee, some in a very moving way, about the disastrous effects of drought on their farms, themselves and their community. Members of the Committee also visited several properties and had informal talks with farmers. This approach to the inquiry allowed the members of the Committee to gain a genuine understanding of the concerns of rural people. I trust&mdash;I certainly shall be working towards this&mdash;that the Committee continues this approach in its future inquiries. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

The amount of work and effort the Committee put into this inquiry will serve both the Government and the community well. I thank those who worked so hard on the secretariat. It was not an easy inquiry. We had to travel all over Australia in a very short period. We looked at 89 submissions and heard 175 witnesses at 17 public hearings in nearly every part of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Chairman said a moment ago, we actually went out to where it was really happening. We went out and talked to the people who have been really hurt by drought to see what was happening to the livestock in those areas, to see what was happening to the country, to see the degradation of the land, because of severe drought. We met with people who were still resolved to have a go, to produce things for the future of Australia. They did not want to lie down and give things away. It was a great eye-opener for all of us on the Committee. It was a happy Committee. We all took on board the evidence that was given and really tried to work out what was going to be best in the long run. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that Australia is a dry continent, but having been a farmer all my life, I did not think it could be as dry as it was in some of the places we went. For example, the situation in Cobar in the western division, which I had visited on other occasions, was absolutely horrific; that at Esperance was not good at all, with people having to battle for survival. We saw the same thing in parts of southern Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee reached the view that drought in Australia is a naturally occurring phenomenon. Therefore, it does not really matter whether drought comes within the natural disaster relief arrangements or whatever. It is important that in times of severe drought the Commonwealth Government has to play a part. That was a belief shared by all members of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Severe drought was taken out of the natural disaster relief arrangements some years ago, and I know that a lot of people who would like to see it put back in. At the beginning of the inquiry I wanted to see severe drought back in the natural disaster relief arrangements. I cannot say that I would not argue in favour of its being back there, but it does not really matter where it is, as long as the Commonwealth Government takes responsibility when severe drought gets beyond the capabilities of an individual and indeed of the State. One of our most sincere recommendations is that the Commonwealth has to play a part, and I believe and hope that that will happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the past few years there has always been an argument between the Commonwealth Government and State governments as to whether a severe drought has existed and what will trigger help and assistance from the Commonwealth Government, which has the biggest coffers when it comes to ensuring that the breeding herd and the breeding flock are retained for the future. If we lose those herds and flocks in severe drought, obviously we cannot come out of those conditions as quickly as we would like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Referring to the Budget tonight, I make the point that this Government came into power on the breaking of the drought in 1983. A good and properly thought out drought policy by the Fraser-Anthony Government had allowed the rural industries to get back on their feet very quickly. Peter Nixon, the Minister at the time, made sure that the national herd and the national flock was retained. As soon as the 1982-83 drought broke, the whole of the economy was able to blossom again because we had breeding herds and breeding flocks that enabled people to start producing for the wealth of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, it does not matter what is in place as long as everyone takes a responsibility. When we brought down this report I made numerous comments, some of which the Chairman has already covered. Wherever we went, we found that although the drought was severe all farmers wanted to become self-sufficient. But they cannot become self-sufficient overnight; it will require many years of saving up money and fodder reserves and building up a bank of money to enable farmers to get through severe droughts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, we recommended that the income equalisation deposit scheme should be made much more effective so that when people deposit money into the scheme in a good year it is totally deductible from their income in that year and tax is not paid on it. When people have money invested with the Government until they need it&mdash;that is, when the next drought starts&mdash;they should get interest on it at the short term bond rate. When they withdraw their money out of that scheme to use during a severe drought, they should be able to pay tax on it at the marginal tax rate that applies in that year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment the IED scheme is working in such a way that, having regard to withholding tax and the other problems existing with income equalisation deposits, when a farmer withdraws money in the year that he needs it he has to pay a whopping tax on it. That is not helping him or her; nor is it giving him or her the incentive to put that money away. It is very good to see the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) sitting opposite, since he is the person who is tied up with the finances of this Government, listening to some of the recommendations we have made. I made recommendations on this to him when he was an assistant Minister. I hope now that from his review of the scheme, taking into account what we have found out in this inquiry, we will get a decent income equalisation deposit scheme. I can assure him that if the Government does not give it to us in the next few months we will definitely give it to the farmers when we return to government at the next election, whether it be in December or in May of next year. Returning to the report, there has to be time for people to put the money away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area that has already been canvassed is when somebody does not make money. How can they put money away? Obviously, we thought very hard on this issue as well. We believe that the introduction of a tax credit scheme relating directly to expenditure on drought proofing is another and different way in which people could save for drought. But there has to be time for transitional arrangements. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator McMullan is talking of the Budget, that is a cracker. Here we have the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Budget Overview and Economic Outlook: 1992-93</EMPHASIS>, page 29, Treasury, average farm product&mdash;estimated obviously&mdash;1992-93, 7 1/4 per cent. It says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Better weather conditions boost farm product.</PARA>
<PARA>I would love to think that weather forecasting could be as good as this Budget has tried to lead us to believe. If the Government has had such a airy-fairy look at IEDs as that document shows, I doubt whether the Government's IED scheme will be what Australian farmers need to get us going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there have to be transitional times to enable people to prepare themselves. No government can abandon primary producers&mdash;and that is exactly what Senator Burns said earlier when he moved for the tabling of this report. Everyone has to be responsible in the drought survival process. The farmers have to be responsible in their own way; but then the Government, when the drought becomes very, very severe, has to play its part. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, basically there was always a problem between State and Federal Ministers concerning the implications and motivations which made the Federal Government give support at a time of drought. Opposition senators have come up with what we call the `trigger mechanism' to activate the Commonwealth's involvement in severe drought. We say that that could include an application from the shire concerned; the use of objective measurements using soil moisture readings; and an overriding subjective assessment by a tripartite drought committee involving the cooperation of Federal and State governments and primary producers. I sincerely believe that that would be a way of taking severe drought from the political area and making sure that the committee always acted in the best interests of both the producer and the State and Federal governments concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area of concern is the rural adjustment scheme. We found that in most places people were not happy with the way drought aid was being given and that it was not being received in the proper way. Although we acknowledged that that scheme is the principal source of drought assistance at the moment, we highlighted several problems with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, transitional arrangements must be in place to enable people to put money aside; they have to have time to prepare. That will require the Government to have a little bit of foresight in giving those incentives to people to actually help themselves prepare. In the meantime, I believe that the Government will have to do more than the $14m allocated for Queensland and the western division of New South Wales as that will be only a drop in the ocean or a speck of sand in the desert. It will be only a little bit of help when, basically, it is a little bit too late. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New South Wales Government has already provided $20m by way of assistance in that State through transaction-based subsidies and other measures. That is one of the arguments I have with the Federal Minister in presenting this drought report. He has suggested that the transaction-based support should be taken away. If we want to retain our herd, if we want to do the right thing by animal welfare, if we want to do the right thing by the environment, I believe it is essential that people get the stock off the farm and are able to bring it back after a drought in a way that actually helps their land, helps the animal welfare aspects of the stock and retains the breeding herd. I must say, to be fair, that Minister Casey in Queensland has actually said that he is not going to phase out the transaction-based subsidies for at least another 10 years because he believes that they are very important for the areas that I have just mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Madam Acting Deputy President, I will read to the chamber a couple of little extracts from people who are suffering from drought. Sitting here in this hallowed atmosphere on Budget night and actually having listened earlier to a Budget that is not going to do Australia any good, that is a throwaway Budget, that is actually a Bankcard Budget which does not address itself to Australia's major problems and issues, we should think of some of the people who have been suffering drought for quite some time. I quote from an article about Wyandra, which is 90 kilometres south on the Warrego, where Phil and Donna Lewis at Max Creek station tell a familiar story of battling along with reserves falling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This article, which was written nearly a year ago, states that it would be catastrophic if the drought drags on deep into 1992. Some of these people have been suffering drought for three years and I think we should just spare a thought for them at this time. The article reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At Max Creek, which covers an area of 10,100ha, there was some rain in February, calving and weaning is finished, 150 cows and calves are on agistment or on the stock reserve down the road, along with 1,200 young ewes. "But we're doing a battle," Phil says, "It's starting to get serious."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">And there is the chill thought of foreclosures in the district.</PARA>
<PARA>I suppose it is very easy for people who live in the cities and towns, especially around the eastern seaboard, not to understand some of the problems associated with those people who are out there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another recent article talked about a station owner out at Cobar, Ian Murphy, who is also a spokesmen for the Western Action Movement. It highlighted the plight facing farmers in that drought area. I can understand his concern and worry. Mr Murphy said that, with overseas aid running at a record level&mdash;$1,600m&mdash;the offer by the Federal Government of $14 million is, as I said earlier, only a speck of sand in the desert out in those areas at the moment. He said that there is a national catastrophe and that the Federal Government should be playing a part. He actually lost a great deal of his sheep and his cattle. He has to get going again and it is going to take time to do it. At the moment he still has equity in his property; he is battling hard against it. I think we should spare a thought for people like Ian Murphy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard a bit of a `humph' from the other side earlier tonight when I said that 70 per cent of New South Wales is still in drought. It is.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are no crops out in some of those areas. Out in the western division a couple of inches is not going to get the feed growing; it is not going to buy the sheep or cattle to get the farmers going; and it is not going to get the productivity going.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that the wool clip has gone back and the commodity prices are down. They have a horrific problem out in that area. With regard to what Senator Panizza said concerning cropping, the average broad acre farmer is going to make a loss this year of at least $29,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite all that, agriculture will make a contribution of something like $14 billion to Australia's export earnings, with a gross value of farm production of some $20 billion. So I think that the Federal Government definitely owes a little bit to the farmers who are producing that export income to maintain the standard of living of all of us, as I have said in this place many times before. Farming directly employs some 400,000 Australians, and two million people rely on farming to earn their living. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is another reason why no government can walk away from farmers in a severe drought or in a severe downturn situation. As I said earlier, commodity prices are down, especially wool. A gentleman told me tonight that he was offered 360c a kilo for his wool clip the other day. For that price it is not even worth producing because he would be running at a loss when the shearing costs and all the other problems are taken into account. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that Senator West from the Government side of the chamber is very interested in rural counselling.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Brownhill mentioned that I might be interested in counselling. I certainly am. I would like to highlight the fact that this Government has increased very significantly the amount of money that has gone to rural counselling services. There has been a large increase. I say thank you very much for that because this is a very important issue. There is a flow on from that. There is a need to support the professionals who provide the counselling. Madam Acting Deputy President, you would be aware of the importance of peer review and support. There is a need to work on one's counselling skills. It is important that we make sure that those services are available for counsellors. That is being worked upon.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think some of the State governments have to look to see whether they are also providing adequate counselling and support services for rural communities. I suspect that often rural counsellors in a number of areas are called upon to do counselling on non-financial-type issues.

There should be adequate back-up and support for those people who require extra counselling, be it in the psychological or mental health area. We must have an adequate number of psychologists, social workers and mental health nurses out in the communities. The States have to look to such a provision of services in the rural areas. This is something the States have not done terribly well. It is even worse when drought and low commodity prices combine to present a handicap. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Brownhill also mentioned feral animals, to which I would add native animals. We hear a great deal of debate amongst some of the green movement to the effect `Let's not endanger our kangaroos'. I can tell the Senate that the great western red and the great western grey are not in any danger of becoming extinct. These animals are in plague proportions. That needs to be recognised by people when we are talking about what the kangaroo cull will be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year I did a trip from Dubbo to Bourke. We arrived in Bourke an hour later than we had planned. From Byrock to Bourke the kangaroos were almost shoulder to shoulder on both sides of the road, and I do not exaggerate. These large animals certainly are benefiting from the permanent water supplies we have provided to them, but they are also being affected by the drought and are dying. They are having a major impact upon the smaller native marsupials; they are destroying the low shrub and low cover that these animals require. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important that we do not get carried away or distracted by some groups who want to save all of the native animals but not look at the particular balances that are so important in these areas. When we are looking at feral animals, we also have to look at the impact that white civilisation has made upon our country by the introduction of horses, goats, pigs, rabbits, camels, and cats. In my travels around western New South Wales, I have met all of those in their feral form, with the exception of buffalo and horses. I certainly have seen camels, goats, pigs and every other sort of feral animal. In Cobar a woman had employed rabbit trappers who in three months had destroyed around 30,000 pairs of rabbits on her property. Those rabbits were horrendous for her income source and also very bad for the land that she was trying to save and support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We received evidence that South Australia never has droughts. I have been to the Eyre Peninsula a couple of times and I am not sure that it is ever suffering anything but a drought; it is a very dry area of the country. At a State level there is no special drought assistance, and therefore, the State has no need to declare droughts. That is one problem that we will have to address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have the problem of the variation that occurs between the various organisations and groups that are responsible for drought declaration within the various States in the country. We saw a very graphic example of that after our trip to western New South Wales and Queensland in January-February, prior to the rains there. A line was drawn at the New South Wales border. The pastoral protection boards that are based on Moree, Walgett and Bourke were all drought declared, as was the western division. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the Queensland border there was a semicircle that left out areas on the Bulloo and the Paroo at Culgoa that were not drought declared. We were looking at a straight line, one side of which was drought declared and the other was not. Obviously droughts do not affect areas in straight lines, and that is one thing that we looked at very carefully in our report when talking about severe drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a need to differentiate between drought and severe drought. There has to be objective assessment as to what is a severe drought and in which areas. There has to be some commonality of ideas and criteria so that we are not left with the crazy situation that we witnessed in southern Queensland where a doughnut-shaped section was not drought declared even though it was as dry as other areas. We looked over the dog fence and we could not tell the difference between conditions on one side of the fence and those on the other. One area had been drought declared and one had not because different criteria were used and different organisations and ways of assessing drought were involved. That is one area that we really have to look at very carefully to ensure that people are not being disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Brownhill talked about 70 per cent of New South Wales being in drought. There is a need in New South Wales to differentiate between areas in severe drought, and that really is the case in the western lands division. Some have had fluky rainfalls but have not had the follow-up rain that is so essential. The people there are suffering and facing some very serious and even critical problems. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to remember that at the last Australian Agricultural Ministers conference, a national drought policy was decided upon. The Government has approved funding of $166.46m in 1992-93 under the rural adjustment scheme. An amount of $14m in this financial year is for extreme drought assistance for New South Wales and Queensland. It is important to note that that is for the extreme drought areas, such as the western division. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government will also provide $15.1m, including $13m of new funds, over four years for land care, drought education and training and drought communication and research.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government will improve the income equalisation deposit scheme and incorporate a farm management bond. The new drought policy is based on self-reliance, risk management, whole farm planning and recognition of drought as a natural feature of the Australian climate. Important components are the improved equalisation deposit scheme and new farm bond management, which will encourage farmers to build up financial reserves to draw on during times of hardship caused by drought and other factors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Key changes include a reduction in the withholding tax rate and an increase in the maximum amount of deposits. The investment component will be increased under the farm management bond. Research and development will be increased to encourage drought preparedness and research in areas such as climate prediction; risk assessment and farm management strategies; pest and weed control and the provision of information; education and training to assist farmers and their advisers to improve their skills; and the communication of appropriate management strategies for drought within the farming community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rural assistance scheme funding includes interest subsidies to facilitate more effective management of farm businesses and to enhance farm productivity and farm adjustment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To say that this Government has done, and is doing, nothing on the issue of severe drought and has no national drought policy is, I think, a total furphy. It is important that people recognise that this Government has done a lot. We have to do some of the things with State governments, and that is not always easy because they seem to want to have their own agendas and go off and do their own thing. But they have to realise that drought crosses all boundaries, knows no State borders and has to be treated as a national issue.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought that I would be speaking after the other members of the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs, but at your invitation, Madam Acting Deputy President, I will speak now. I am not a member of that Committee, but I do not think I have to be part of a committee to speak about drought in Australia. I am comfortable with speaking about drought this evening, knowing that Western Australia is having one of its best seasons ever. But no matter how many good seasons I have experienced or will experience in the rest of my life, I will never forget that drought is always looking over my shoulder.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have looked at the recommendations of this Committee and I will go through them and comment on them one by one. The first recommendation states that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Rural Adjustment Scheme (RAS) form the basis for Commonwealth involvement in providing assistance under a national drought policy.</PARA>
<PARA>I thought that had always been the case. To my knowledge, the rural adjustment scheme is the basis of providing carry-on finance or whatever is needed. That has always been its purpose. I have been a critic of the rural adjustment scheme in the past 10 years. I have only ever heard complaints about it from the Western Australian side. Although the funds have been provided by this Government together with matching funds from the Government of Western Australia, distributing them has always been a problem. RAFCOR is responsible for investigating the applications and distributing the funds in Western Australia. But every year my office receives complaints from people who are involved in the industry that the finance does not get out in time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said time and time again in this place that it is useless receiving finance to plant a crop one month after the prime seeding time. In Western Australia, the prime seeding time is between 1 May&mdash;if there is suitable rain&mdash;and about 8 June. It varies a bit in different areas, but that is the prime time. But time and time again the allocations from RAFCOR have come through one month after that. After all, when one is in the crop game one tries to have everything ready, especially the goods one buys for the crop. The main one is fertiliser. It is always a very good idea to have it in hand at the beginning of the year when it is a bit cheaper and then one will not be held up in getting it onto the place by February. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the farmers who rely on that sort of finance do not get the finance okayed until the middle of May, they need another week or so to get the item onto the property. The same happens with chemicals. It is no good being able to afford to buy the chemicals in July which are needed by farmers in May if they are cropping. I have said time and time again that RAFCOR&mdash;which is the name Western Australia gives to its scheme&mdash;and the schemes used by the other States for distributing the rural adjustment scheme funds are too inefficient and slow. Obviously, they are not in the best position to work out whether a farm is viable and it is worth putting more money into it to carry on. It is pointless to come to that decision either past the prime time or at the prime time, because time is wasted otherwise. Hopefully, one day this will sink in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have always advocated that the local bank manager, or whoever normally deals with these people, is in a far better position to see whether someone is viable or not and worthy of receiving further carry-on funds. If it is kept local, the banks know the farmers personally and their working and farming habits. The local banks know all these sorts of things and it is better that they deal with the finance rather than organisations which are far removed from these farming areas. I do not know why they carry on in this way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next recommendation refers to transaction-based subsidies or rebates being discontinued. I have no worries whatsoever about supporting that recommendation, because I believe that is not the way to go about things. Certainly, I would not recommend that any subsidies or rebates of that kind be brought in because they only lead to inefficiencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next recommendation made by the Committee is that structural improvements for the storage of grain, hay or fodder should be allowable as an immediate tax deduction in the year in which the expenditure is incurred. That is a very important recommendation which should be taken up by the Government. Those sorts of measures were around during the Fraser and Menzies years and in between those years. If I remember rightly, deductions for water conservation and fodder conservation were more than 100 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the main reasons why I believe this expenditure should be allowable as a tax deduction in the year of income is that generally, when there is a build up of stored fodder, including hay, oats, barley, lupins, or anything like that, this is the year of a good crop and plentiful supply. When a farmer has an above average season he carries out conservation that year for possible droughts that may show up in the next one, two, three, four or five years. To begin with, the funds would be available in those years of high production and high income. High profit under this Government seems to be a non-event these days, but when the cash is avail</PARA>
<PARA>the availability of better earthmoving machines, have commenced a program of storing water. Under the Fraser Government, a full deduction of 100 per cent was allowed for dam sinking&mdash;in other words, building earthen tanks&mdash;in the first year of income. There was a big expansion. With storage to a depth of about 8 or 9 metres, and a climate with 13 to 18 inches of rainfall, there is natural evaporation of about 3 metres a year, if I have it right. Even if a lot of water in those dams or earth tanks is used, it should last for three years under normal circumstances. In those three years suitable rainfall can be expected to refill the dams. It has been my experience that, except in an extreme drought, the bottom of a dam built to a depth of 8 metres will not be seen for many years. I believe this is a recommendation that the Government should look at for the conservation of water and also for conveying water&mdash;in other words, piping it from one place to another. Of course, windmills also take water from underground and put it into tanks. It is a good recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next recommendation is that the income equalisation deposit scheme should be reviewed. Back in the late 1960s or early 1970s, if I remember correctly, Doug Anthony, the Leader of the National Party at the time&mdash;if he is not remembered for anything else; I am sure he will be remembered for other things&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure he will, but if he is remembered for anything it will be the IED scheme. He carried out the research and put the scheme into place during the time of a Liberal government. I believe that certainly played a major part in the conservation of cash on the farm. Water and fodder can be conserved, but along with that cash has also to be conserved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The IED scheme was a very simple one. In a better year with a cash flow, a farmer would put a certain amount away and that amount would not be counted as income in that year. Any amount withdrawn during drier years when income was not so great would be counted as income. The farmer could withdraw the money and pay tax at whatever the nominal rate was for that year. In other words, that farmer would be taxed on his income plus any withdrawal made during that year. If I remember correctly, the figures from that time got up to $15m, $16m, $18m or $20m. There was a limit on the amount a farmer could deposit, but I believe it was a moderate limit and the farmers of Australia used the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then along came the Hawke Government in 1983. My friend Senator Walsh, who lives not that far from me in Western Australia, about 100 kilometres away, at the time decided in his wisdom that it was a rort. I could never see what sort of a rort it was, but he thought that the effective interest rate for farmers with money in the scheme, with these deductions, would be higher than for anyone else from some other calling in life who saved money. So for some reason of his own or because of the ideology of the rest of the Government, which was as far left as honourable senators see on this front bench, he wanted to get rid of the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To make sure the numbers of farmers depositing into the scheme started reducing, the Government dropped the interest rate by one per cent every year until it got down to zero. I know that, in time, the farmers withdrew the money&mdash;maybe because they were having tougher times, but I suppose also because no interest at all was being accumulated. I know some farmers who still have money in the scheme and have left it there gaining no interest at all rather than kowtow to the Government's tactics and withdraw it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After that, in 1982, there was a big drought in the eastern States. Unfortunately, that was when Malcolm Fraser called the election. As Senator Button keeps telling us, when the Australian Labor Party took over government, there was a high unemployment rate&mdash;but that was only caused by the eastern States drought. It was normal rate for the time. The drought very kindly broke for the Labor Party in March of the next year when it got into government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After those droughts, I think by 1987 when I first came here, the Government reintroduced some sort of IED. The Government tried to make it work, but unfortunately got it all wrong and no big amounts of cash have ever been deposited, even though there were the wool boom years of 1986 to 1989 and good wheat years at about the same time. The deposits have never built up again because of the rather punitive measures that were in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The savings of farmers at that time were knocked down very much. The flush years would have been a good time to have such a scheme. Unfortunately, the scheme was not there and the farmers paid their income out in tax. The recession has now bitten. Because of the recession we had to have, caused by the then Treasurer and now Prime Minister (Mr Keating), people in most parts of the bush are again in a very bad situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee recommends the review of the income equalisation deposit scheme. But the point is that we have it well covered in Fightback, and we will be the ones who will be putting it into action in government next year. The next recommendation is in regard to the desirability of rural bond schemes being reviewed. I believe certainly something should be done there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next recommendation is that there should be appropriate Commonwealth support for rural counselling. I believe that should be available, but that rural counselling should be split into two areas. It is all very well to have a rural financial counsellor, but one cannot expect that person to counsel on other matters. I will not comment on the counselling of families by psychologists or that sort of person or the counselling that is available with government assistance. Where I believe rural counselling has failed miserably is in regard to financial matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been a farmer most of my life, and I would say that the day that I need a financial adviser or a farm adviser will be the day that I get out of farming. I presume there is a place in society for farm advisers. But who are the farm advisers and rural counsellors paid by the Government to advise farmers who are in strife?  We see farmers who have gone broke themselves. How often do we see it?  Time and time again. I believe in learning from others, and in taking notice of what others are doing to see whether I can improve my way, but I will not listen to someone who has gone down the tube through mismanagement, over-capitalisation and the other sorts of things that may put people down the tube. Yet here we have these people employed to do just that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A farmer who has gone broke, who has been driven off or whatever, has to get a job and has to earn a living. But for God's sake, if I can use that term, he should be put in a job where he has proved to be successful. Rural counselling by someone who has gone down the tube I cannot support. But this is happening, and I believe if we are to do something in rural counselling we should put in good financial experts rather than someone who has fallen in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next recommendation is that a sustainable management strategy for kangaroos should be developed. Senator West spent quite a bit of time on this one. I was under the belief that droughts, as well as having a negative effect on crops and the output from animals such as sheep and cattle, also controlled pests to a certain extent. But I agree with Senator West that in extreme circumstances kangaroos, because they are able to withstand such conditions a bit longer than the stock, can get into plague proportions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to comment here that the green movement, the environmentalist movement in Australia, has put Australia in that position. For 200 years Australia had sensible control of feral animals, but in the last 15-odd years, or maybe even less than that, that seems to have gone out the window. Now we cannot deal with this or we cannot trap that or we cannot shoot that and protect our own properties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are A-class reserves, national parks, that are set up alongside the rural community, but one can do nothing with feral animals that come out of those places. Madam Acting Deputy President, I will give you a good example. Getting out into the pastoral areas, a station near my home was bought out by the State Government and turned into a reserve of some sort. Prior to becoming a reserve, it was a sheep station. Everyone who ever owned the station always had to control the dingoes. They did that by baiting and trapping them. As the station is now a reserve, one cannot bait the dingoes, so they come out into the more built-up areas and attack sheep and cattle. No-one is allowed to do anything about that unless they see the dingo and go out and chase it; if they lose sight of it, they cannot do anything more about it. What utter stupidity! Senator Crichton-Browne knows the area I am referring to very well&mdash;around Koolyanobbing in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To add insult to injury, that station had a dam and used waterholes when it was running sheep. If those dogs could get something to eat and they had water, they would stay there. The dozers are now going around filling in the dams; one will not be able to catch water and the dingoes will need to go out further into agricultural areas to look for water, which will create a bigger problem. This is a worry. I certainly hope the Government in the short time it has left in office will do something about the last recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to a matter which is not mentioned in the report. I have always believed that for any industry, especially the rural industry, to be able to survive in the long term one must have outside investments; in other words, one must spread one's investments. That is always good advice, whether one is a farmer, a share trader or whatever. Under this Government's policies, that has never been encouraged; in fact, it has been discouraged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Business people, whether they be farmers or small business people, have been taxed out of existence through primary tax, government levies, fuel levies and land tax&mdash;at least there is no land tax on rural properties in Western Australia. There has not been any ability in the past 10 years to invest off-property. I can remember some of the rural counsellors who, for some reason, cropped up in the late 1970s. If a farmer was getting down in his cash flow, the first thing they told him to do was sell any real estate off-farm. That was the most stupid financial advice I have ever heard in my life, yet it was given time and time again. If I ever reached the situation where I needed a farming adviser, I would get out of farming immediately. That is the sort of wrong advice that farmers and others have been given in the past 15-odd years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Government is to do something, the best thing it can do is to get out of the way of business. The Fightback package contains such measures. The best thing a government can do is get out of the way and let people farm, mine, operate transport, et cetera, so that they can build themselves up. Taxation measures should be looked at for innovative industries that can go up and down, such as mining. Farmers could then set up a base of off-farm investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1960s I used to take part in many debates on off-farm investment compared with on-farm investment. The most frequent debating partner I had on that issue was my father, as we held different views. We held mostly similar views, but on a few issues we held dissimilar views. The farmers who went the way I referred to have been well rewarded. They have been able to keep their farms in hard times free of debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, because my time is running out, I commend the Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs for its report and recommendations. However, it is all very well for the Committee to report and make recommendations, but the next thing that needs to be done is for the Government&mdash;in the time it has left&mdash;to take the recommendations and act and not put the report on the shelf and forget about it as it gathers dust. </PARA>

As previous speakers have said, we are very lucky to have such a very good secretariat, particularly our secretary, Neil Bessell. Whilst the report is not very long, it certainly gets to the nub of the problems. I am very proud of the fact that this report has a bit of feeling about it. In fact, in the report there is a foreword with a couple of photographs. I was going to comment to Senator West, although she is not here now, that there are a couple of very good photos of her in her elegant straw hat to keep the sun off. However, the photos show members of the Committee talking to members of the farming community at a place called Grass Patch in Western Australia which was experiencing a drought. My colleague Senator Crane was responsible for taking us to look at a drought in Western Australia. It was not much different from any other drought that I have seen because it had the same effect on farmers as does any drought around Australia. </PARA>

We had to ask ourselves why this report came about: what was the motivation behind it. The motivation behind it was, of course, that the drought policy review task force brought down its recommendations in 1990 and as a committee we felt that there was no better way to test out a task force recommendation than to actually go and see how in practice these particular recommendations could be accommodated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Fair enough. Actually, in 1980 we had 11 inches of rain and in 1981 we had 10 inches. It was pretty similar to the type of territory in which Senator Collins lives. Senator Bell would probably remember that, too.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the reason for establishing this Committee was to put a human face on what has become something that Australian farmers have lived with ever since settlement of this country. It was heart-rending to see some farmers, particularly out in the western district, out the back of Bourke, which was one place I had always wanted to visit. So I have actually been to the back of Bourke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting to listen to the experiences of people who have been there for four generations. One could actually feel their frustration and their sorrow at not being able to do anything about their stock. All farmers have a certain amount of feeling for their stock&mdash;some more than others&mdash;but I remember that one particular farmer had a huge property with a very low stocking capacity. He had 150,000 sheep and he guessed that he might have 10,000 left if he were lucky. He was not going to look for them because they were so weak that they would probably fall over and die, if they had not already died. To see a proud man like that speaking to us with tears in his eyes certainly brought home to me the personal effect that this terrible drought has had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the drought were not bad enough, the decline in wool prices, the recession and high interest rates&mdash;all those things that have never happened before at the same time&mdash;have really knocked the stuffing out of our rural communities. I was looking at some figures today and saw, for instance, that as of August this year the average broad acre farmer&mdash;that is one who grows wool and wheat&mdash;will make a loss this year on average of $29,100. That is pretty tragic stuff when it is coupled with the effect on small businesses. That would include a lot of people in rural areas. The number of bankruptcies for the financial year 1991-92 was about 17,857. Things are pretty tough out there. Whilst the farmers are suffering, we found that all those other people in rural towns were also suffering as a result of what was happening in the bush. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking back on some personal recollections, as I said earlier, I always remember that Senator West's hat was continually blowing off. I also remember the tragic story of one particular woman at Cobar who worked as a nurse as well as running her own farm. She had lost most of her stock and retained some of her breeding herd. It was estimated that in that particular area alone there were about 150,000 dead sheep because of the drought. I must commend the secretariat, as the cover of the report itself says it all; it shows just a desert with a whole heap of woody weeds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A person from the Department of Primary Industries and Energy showed me some photos from a dry spell in Bourke a couple of years earlier of rabbits eating other rabbits to survive. That was all that was left for them to eat. They were eating themselves. It shows how drought creates problems, even for feral animals. To see rabbits feeding off dead rabbits to survive shows how desperate the situation was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the positive side, I was quite proud that every area our Committee&mdash;which some of us called Burns's drought-breakers&mdash;visited, apart from the western division of New South Wales, received reasonably substantial rain within two to four weeks after we left the place, and some areas even received it while we were there. I remember that Tasmania was having some sort of drought, and it rained the next day. I think we put our expertise to practical use. I know from Senator Crane that Western Australia received some useful rain a few weeks after we had been there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said earlier that all droughts were the same, but I will have to change my comments on that somewhat. In Senator Crane's area of south Western Australia&mdash;which is very light, sandy country around Jerdacuttup and Ravensthorpe&mdash;I was very concerned, as were all members of the Committee, that the dry weather was having a tremendous effect on soil degradation. There was plenty of evidence that the fragile, light and sandy country that had been cleared there not all that long ago was under a fair amount of threat from wind erosion. That is one of the side effects of drought that we cannot put a price on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although we made most of our visits earlier this year, I have been travelling around on other committees. Last Thursday I was in the home State of Senator Bjelke-Petersen. The Joint Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works was approving a new tax office. Around Australia it seems to be the only growth industry. There are new tax office buildings going up everywhere. It will create 400 jobs in Brisbane, so I think it will be good for the local economy. The day I was there I got out of bed and I thought I would go for a walk. I looked out and I thought, `Goodness me, this can't be Brisbane. There's a fog rolling across the city'. Then I thought, `It's not fog; it must be smog'. I realised afterwards that it was dust blowing from the drought areas of western New South Wales and south-west Queensland. It brought back to me the horrific things that we saw during our investigation into this particular problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the areas we visited were almost like Bondi Beach. In fact, when we went out in the western division of New South Wales, my first impression was, `Why don't we give it back to the animals because that is all it is good for'. We were told that in a good year something like $1 billion of wool is produced in that area. That is a fair amount of money even in today's terms. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a lot of money in today's terms. Even with the shonky accounting of the Government in the Budget tonight, it is still a lot of money. It is needed to keep this country going. As I said earlier, it is a thriving community. I reckon the people who work out there not only need assistance, they also need a medal to stay there. But they do stay there, and they love it. We talked to people who were making more money getting rid of kangaroos than they were from sheep farming. Since we left the place, one of the chaps we spoke to has walked off his farm. The only thing left on it is his son who goes out shooting the kangaroos. I think he is keeping up the payments on the farm by doing that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that was touched on tonight and that I found rather interesting was the evidence given to us by Mr Barry Hunt, the Chief Research Scientist with the CSIRO Division of Atmospheric Research in Melbourne and by Dr Gauntlet, the Acting Director of the Bureau of Meteorology in Melbourne. Ten or so years ago, when the farmers on the east coast of Australia started hearing about the El Nino effect, we thought it was something like UFOs&mdash;a bit of speculation without much fact behind it. But it has come to light from investigations that there is an El Nino effect. It does occur at regular periods. It can be forecast, as has been shown by the evidence given to us. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5F4">Senator CALVERT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will tell you in a minute. Of all the facts that came out of the evidence we received&mdash;some 89 submissions and some 175 witnesses at some 79 public hearings&mdash;the El Nino effect is one of the most important. With the work that is being done on atmospheric research, at present it can be predicted a year ahead, with 50 per cent accuracy, whether there will be a dry spell or a drought, particularly the El Nino effect. We know how it starts now; it starts north of Australia, moves down through the Pacific and creates all these problems.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I was most disturbed to hear in our evidence that the Government is considering withdrawing funding for this research&mdash;something like $600,000 a year. I have not had a chance to peruse the entire Budget yet, but I have heard from Senator McMullan tonight that there is some good news in it about IEDs. I hope that there is also some good news in it of continuing funding for this research.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was in the United Kingdom recently on a Commonwealth Parliamentary Association conference, I had an opportunity to talk to some members of African countries who were experiencing the tremendously severe drought that is still occurring in Africa. They asked me what our country was doing about helping them. I made some inquiries and found that our Government is being reasonably generous and that over $4m has already been given in cash aid. The citizens of Australia have also been very generous in donating through various organisations. Even so, Africa is experiencing a tremendous drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After hearing this, I had a lot of pleasure in telling the friends that I had met in Zambia, Zimbabwe and Kenya that the research that was being carried out in Australia, with its new computer modelling, has the ability&mdash;it was demonstrated to us in very logical terms&mdash;to forecast the same El Nino effect in regard to the east coast of Africa. So if we continue this research, and if the computer modelling is allowed to continue over the next few years, there is every chance that in three or four years time we will be 75 per cent accurate in predicting drought, not only on the east coast of Australia but also on the east coast of Africa. What better form of aid could we give to our African neighbours than to allow them to predict droughts and to drought-proof themselves to a certain extent for the dry spells as they came along?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was one of the key recommendations of the Committee and one of the key issues that came through the whole report&mdash;that the farmers want to drought-proof themselves; they want to be self-reliant. But, of course, every now and again we get these conditions which snowball and we end up with the situation that we have in some areas of Australia where assistance is needed. I am pleased to see that the Government has given some sort of aid&mdash;$14m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Panizza has just told me that El Nino means `the baby'. I just hope that the baby is not thrown out with the bath water when research is being done on El Nino, as we certainly need that research to continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to see that most of the things that we identified have also been worked on by the New South Wales Government and I note that Mr Fahey, the new Premier of New South Wales, is increasing rural transport subsidies from $3m to $5m, which will be of great assistance to farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other things that I noticed in this press report&mdash;it was touched on earlier tonight&mdash;was rural counselling. Senator West took a particular interest in this. It is certainly not a very enjoyable job that these rural counsellors have. We spoke to quite a few of them. In fact, a lot of them needed counselling themselves after a certain amount of time because they were getting worn down by the tales of degradation and of the sorrow and bad luck that people are experiencing. The rural counsellor out in the area that I believe is the worst affected, the area out near Bourke, is dealing with 70 people with a combined debt of $30m. One can just imagine the problems they must have. One has to ask oneself whether they will ever get out of that debt and survive; I do not think a lot of them will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just hope that in the Budget Papers tonight there might be a bit of help. I have already heard that there is very little assistance, if any, or any hope for small business, the private sector of our community. If that runs through the Budget, as I think it does, the farmers cannot hold out much hope. The drought that we looked at and reported on is the worst for 12 years in the Bourke area, with stock losses up to 90 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area that has not been touched on tonight but which I was impressed by&mdash;it does not necessarily follow that this happens in every State&mdash;was the role that local government plays in some areas, particularly New South Wales, in sharing the burden of a natural disaster such as drought. I was pleased to hear about some of the things that the shire councils in the western division of New South Wales are doing; for instance, rate relief for land-holders, provision of work on shire projects, hiring equipment from farmers to give them a better cash flow, allowing grazing on public land and maintaining those very important stock routes and public watering facilities that are needed during drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most important&mdash;this has already been touched on tonight&mdash;is the participation in programs to reduce pests and feral animals. In these dry times we had evidence that some farms are overstocked by feral animals or kangaroos before even one head of sheep, cattle or anything else is put on them. This shows the effect that native animals such as kangaroos and feral animals such as wild horses, rabbits and the like are having on what is already a critical situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee made a lot of recommendations. I just hope that the Government takes some note of them. The task force handed down its recommendations in 1990. This report comes in 1992. I do not know whether we will be looking at it again in 1994 or some such time to see what has happened. But I can assure you, Mr Acting Deputy President&mdash;the Chairman of the Committee has already made this point&mdash;that we will be reviewing this to see what is happening. Unless we do, this report will be like a lot of other reports in this place that just end up gathering dust on a shelf. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to speak tonight to the Government responses to the recommendations of the drought policy review task force. Although I was not a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs, I have certainly listened with a great deal of interest to what some of the members of the Committee have told us about the trips that they have had and the investigations that they have carried out into drought. It is something that I believe all members of the Senate should be most interested in. The beginning of the report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Throughout the inquiry, the Committee was impressed with the fortitude and resilience of the farming community. Time and again, the Committee was told by members of this important section of the Australian community that they do not want handouts, they want to be self-reliant but must be given the opportunity to prepare for drought.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Calvert said that he was looking at the photographs in this report. I was quite interested to see a couple of photographs in the report; I think it helps to make it interesting for those of us who were not there and to let us know of the tremendous amount of work that the Committee has put into this report to make it something that we are all able to read and take part in. Page 1 of the report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Task Force recognised that drought is a natural and recurring condition and therefore is a normal commercial risk that should be included in the management decisions of Australian rural enterprises. Consequently, managing for drought is about managing for the risks involved in undertaking a farm business, given the vagaries of climate and the prospects of variable seasonal conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have a son who lives on a property on the McKenzie River in central Queensland. He has been there for about 10 years and he has had two terrible droughts. It cost an enormous amount of money to buy enough fodder to make sure that his cattle did not die. Because he is on the McKenzie River, he has also had two terrible floods. I have yet to decide which is worse&mdash;the droughts or the floods. The floods bring down weeds from further up and they whisk cattle away. In one case the poor bulls were so big and heavy they could not swim and they all went down. Quite a lot of the stock were taken away and ended up miles and miles down the river. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very difficult to manage for drought; we just never know when it is coming. It is certainly a very expensive business to have enough fodder to keep cattle going. I just hope that before long there will be some rain in his part of Queensland because a tremendous amount of Queensland is suffering from drought at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee sought this reference from the Senate because it was concerned that, although some of the recommendations of the 1990 report of the drought policy review task force had been implemented, in two years most of them had not been acted upon. In the past two years, when very few of the recommendations were applied, many areas in Australia have been, or have become, gripped with drought. That is what Senator Calvert and Senator Brownhill were speaking to the Senate about earlier. Only today the front page of Brisbane's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Drought gripping Queensland is set to strip hundreds of millions of dollars from the State's battered rural economy as sheep die by the thousands, weakened cattle flood onto the market and crops fail.</PARA>
<PARA>I saw a very sad picture in our paper a few days ago of a man in Charleville who was trying to keep his sheep alive by bulldozing down some of the brigalow scrub around the place. He would work in Charleville during the week and go out at the weekend to try to keep his remaining 2,000 sheep alive so that when the drought breaks, which we hope will be soon, he will at least be able to have some stock on his property. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report notes further that the drought is spreading from the west and north into the State's top wheat country. Summer rains largely failed through the centre of the State and now, at the end of winter, there has been very little useful rain. The report notes in the foreword:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Throughout the inquiry, the Committee was impressed with the fortitude and resilience of the farming community. Time and again, the Committee was told by members of this important section of the Australian community&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>as I said earlier&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that they do not want handouts.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what the farming community is like. It is very self-reliant and very anxious to do the best it can with what it has. It certainly has not been given the chance to prepare for what is now referred to as a natural and recurring condition. I often wonder when the Government will stop sitting on its hands and start doing something useful to help the drought-stricken Queensland primary producer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did note that the Senate Committee report also recommends that financial assistance be provided to farmers experiencing severe drought. It also has recognised that there is an essential role for the Commonwealth to play in relieving farmers from this severe drought. One point that was brought out by a number of members of the Committee is the fact that $14m has been made available by the Government for drought assistance. But there are lots of people everywhere around Australia in the drought areas, not only in Queensland but in New South Wales and so many other parts of Australia. It is very difficult to make $14m go around to the areas that really need it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that we need the Government to stand behind our primary producers and to accept the fact that they have a major role to play in the prosperity and financial recovery of Australia. </PARA>

If this Government lacks that resolve then it does not deserve to represent anybody, let alone the farmers and their families who contribute so much to Australia's real wealth. Senator Boswell told me that in the Budget tonight farmers have not got anything that will help them very much at all. In fact, he said they will be going the other way, down the drain. I certainly believe that our rural people, particularly in good seasons, play a vital and important role in our export earnings; there is no doubt about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What gives the drought crisis we face special importance is the fact that it comes on top of a rural crisis. Increased costs by the Government, depressed commodity prices, high interest rates, and the collapse of the wool floor price scheme have already set farmers and farming families reeling. Even before the drought started they were in a bad financial position. That is why it is not possible for them always to prepare for drought, as the report says they should. That is why there are so many families throughout the bush already facing financial ruin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Health care workers in remote Australia are also discovering for the first time in postwar memory actual poverty and actual near starvation. Furthermore, as a result of this current Government's policies, young rural Australians already have reduced opportunities for education, health services, cultural experience and future employment. I brought to the Senate this morning a notice of motion regarding that matter. The Government's failure to address this situation will lead to long-term disadvantages for rural Australians who are being denied their right to full education at both secondary and tertiary levels. Mr Acting Deputy President, you would know just how important it is for young people to have the opportunity for tertiary education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To tell honourable senators just how bad the drought situation is in my own State of Queensland, I will read from a report published in our <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> just today. It seemed to me to be very appropriate, with the emergence of this drought report and the measures the Government, we hope, will continue to implement for people in drought situations, that this article should be in our paper today. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More than one-quarter of Queensland is gripped by drought with a horror spring season set to batter the state economy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rural income will be stripped by hundreds of millions of dollars as sheep die by the thousands, weakened cattle flood onto the market and crops fail.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The drought focus has been on the extensive western and northern areas but is spreading through some of the state's best cropping country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The queue for drought declarations is lengthening daily at the Primary Industries Department natural disaster section. . . there were now 9500 properties officially drought declared from the western Queensland border at Goondiwindi to Atherton in far north Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Several shires were expected next month to join the 21 shires already declared drought stricken. . . large areas of central and western Queensland and the far north were failing rapidly with property owners facing stock water shortages.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`There has been insufficient water to fill dams in many regions&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Regrettably, this Government did away with any tax concessions for farmers who wanted to build dams. That, I believe, is one of the problems that is confronting people facing droughts at the present time. We used to be able to get tax concessions for making dams and provision for water on our properties, but that was all taken away, and that has not helped in any situation at all. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> further notes that the Department had received:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . reports from Bollon and Charleville districts of 30 to 40 per cent flock losses. . . For many people it is just not a viable proposition to buy feed.'</PARA>
<PARA>In addition:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . freight costs to move stock would be more than the sheep were worth in many cases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There had been a huge exodus of cattle from the worst affected areas, particularly the north. Movements of 25,000 head a week were putting pressure on already shaky markets.</PARA>
<PARA>The article continues, stating that rainfalls:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . for the 16 months to the end of June were the lowest since 1946 at Blackall and Tambo.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Charleville was the driest since records were instigated 47 years ago.</PARA>
<PARA>It is no wonder that poor man was having so much trouble keeping some feed up to the 2,000 sheep that were left on his property. Mr Acting Deputy President, if you could have seen the photograph in the paper, you would have realised just how bad it really was&mdash;and he had already lost 8,000 sheep; he had been unable to save them. So it is very bad indeed out in the west. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party talks loudly about social justice, but rural people apparently are not part of the social justice program. Its economic policies have already been ruinous to anyone trying to contribute to the productivity of the nation. Those of us who inhabit this nation are all Australians.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that, regrettably, this Government has helped to create these two nations. It has done nothing to try to bridge the rift. Indeed, its policies have contributed to a disturbing widening of the gulf between these two sections of our nation. So often we find that its neglect effectively punishes those who for a variety of reasons choose not to live in the cities and the big rural towns. I regret to say that to be a non-metropolitan Australian under this Government is to be second class, a member of the B team, a reserve grade Australian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last few years I have made quite a number of speeches on each of these subjects as they have become more and more critical to our national financial welfare. They also involve the disintegration of a lifestyle and society which have served Australia well in the past. If we fail any&mdash;I reiterate the word `any'&mdash;of our rural industries now, we will continue to see the disintegration of rural Australian society as many of us have known. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been very distressing to note that the profound shift in Australia's export earnings from farm products to other economic sectors has left primary producers with shrinking incomes. These changes mean that we simply cannot afford to sit back and wait for the farm sector to be virtually depopulated, which is starting to happen all over Australia. It is not only happening in south Burnett, where I come from, but also in many other rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government cannot claim that the crisis and the drought in rural Australia has only just hit. It has been warned continuously for years.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also wish to acknowledge the very fair way Senator Burns chaired the various meetings. The process which we developed this year with this inquiry was mentioned earlier tonight. The people who attended were invited to make a short statement of three to five minutes from the floor. I suggested this course because in other inquiries one often heard pearls of wisdom over a cup of coffee; they would never be recorded. I was very pleased that that course was followed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one looks at records and figures of the Australian economy, it is very apparent that when the bush is doing well the community is also doing well. That is a fact. For instance, in 1982-83 we found that when the recovery occurred in the farming and grazing sector it flowed right through the economy. It is very important that, when we consider such things as the national drought policy, we look at the overall impact on the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report is a report that should never have happened. It should not have been necessary for us to present such a report. This report came about because of a number of events. When we were considering the Committee's interim report we talked about the report of the task force which came down in May 1990, which is now well over two years ago. That report has virtually sat gathering dust. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just want to take the Senate back a little further. In 1986-87 I sat on a national drought committee which brought down a report for then Minister Kerin. The Department and the Minister did not like that report. So that one was put on the shelf and allowed to gather dust. The next drought policy review task force brought down a report which, while not identical, was very similar to the report that was brought down in 1987. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of a national drought policy there is a need, first of all, for consistency between States. There is a need to identify the responsibilities of the States, the Commonwealth and local government. It has been very clear for a long time that there has been much inconsistency in the policies of the various States and the way in which they are treated by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have also been inconsistencies in the way in which drought has been determined in the various regions. For example, we found that drought is a regular feature in certain areas. Yet we also found that significantly harder criteria for the purposes of drought declaration applied to other regions which are significantly drier. I think it is very important that there be consistency across the full range of drought policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the time that is available to me I would like to look at some of the specific recommendations that have come out of the report of the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs. There are two things that we can say are significantly different, or on which much more emphasis has been placed, when we compare our report with the report of the drought policy review task force. The first is that we put much more emphasis on the importance of tax credits as a means of achieving self-reliance, and I will say a little more about that later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, we recommended that in times of severe drought there is a role for the Commonwealth to play. Transaction levies are part of the role that the Commonwealth should play in protecting the national herd and the sheep flock. Transaction levies should be administered in such a way that they assist in preserving the breeding flock in the national interest and returning the breeding flock to the property of origin. There is no doubt that under the previous arrangements there was some rorting of the system in some States. It is not difficult to overcome that problem. I believe that we addressed that aspect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very pleased to see that the Committee reached a unanimous position on its recommendations in respect of a national drought policy. I have to say I did not expect that that would be the case when I attended the last meeting. But we came to similar conclusions as we worked through the various recommendations and we were able to reach a unanimous position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as a national drought policy is concerned, consistent with previous reports it was agreed that emphasis should be placed on self-reliance. It is important that transitional arrangements be put in place to allow a change from previous drought policies. It is unreasonable for farmers affected by drought, as it is for people in any industry, not to be given time to adjust to new circumstances brought about by a policy switch put in place virtually overnight. We put some emphasis on the importance of transitional arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have noted what other speakers have said here tonight on a number of matters. I particularly wish to comment on Senator Bjelke-Petersen's comments that she was disappointed that we did not move back to having drought included in the natural disaster relief arrangements. I do not think whether or not it is in there is important, provided we have a comprehensive, proper national drought policy. I have no doubt that it can work within natural disaster relief arrangements, but it can also work outside the natural disaster relief arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one significant difference between drought and other disasters such as flood, cyclone or fire. They are events that generally occur very quickly. They are over and done with and they fit neatly into a financial year. Under the previous natural disaster relief arrangements, if a drought started a couple of months before the end of the financial year, people had to commence 1 July on a new financial trigger, even though they had been suffering a drought for a couple of months. A drought creeps up, whereas these other events often occur overnight and usually last no longer than a day or two or a week. I think it is important that, whether the drought policy be in or out, it be recognised that it is quite different in the way it creeps up on us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to comment in particular on the rural adjustment scheme and evidence that was given to us regarding it. I am very concerned about the rural adjustment scheme. I think it, unfortunately, has failed Australian agriculture. I am particularly concerned that it is now being asked to be all things to all people. Concern was expressed to us during the hearings about the fact that drought has come under the rural adjustment scheme. Concern was also expressed that the social security arrangements for farmers have come under the rural adjustment scheme. The problem is that the Rural Adjustment Authority does not have the expertise to handle these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From my previous experiences on the drought consultative committee in Western Australia, I believe that when drought was handled by a different arrangement, separate from the Rural Adjustment Authority, it did not get mixed up and confused with the various parts A, B and C of the rural adjustment scheme. The problem with the Rural Adjustment Authority, which is subject to review, is that when people go before it, if it happens to point what I call the big finger C&mdash;that is, part C&mdash;they should run 100 miles, because as soon as it does that, that is the finish. It is virtually saying, `You are out of farming and there will be no assistance'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As soon as that happens, banks, stock firms, financiers, suppliers and everybody else walks away. My advice to people in agriculture, whether farming or pastoral, is that when the rural adjustment authorities, no matter in which State they are, start signifying that they are a candidate for part C, they should get out of the door as quickly as they can run, because that is the death knell. It will determine by the stroke of a pen whether people are viable or non-viable. In my view, one is never non-viable until one gives up. It should not be determined by somebody with a stroke of a pen, depending on the particular situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know my time is drawing to an end and I would like to continue these remarks at another time. I must comment on a couple of other aspects, particularly the tax arrangements regarding tax credits, which is a recommendation that we put before the Government. Tax credits have a significant advantage over the current arrangements, in that they are much fairer and more equitable. When a particular operation has a problem with drought and tries to get into self-reliance, very seldom is it paying much tax so taxation arrangements, in terms of depreciation, are of little value. It would be far more equitable and fair if the Government were to put in place a system of tax credits, as recommended by the Committee, to the tune of 75 per cent of the highest marginal tax rate, whatever that might be. I recommend to the Minister for Primary Industries that he pursue our recommendation. </PARA>

He was actively and enthusiastically supported by many people in his work in Australia. Among them was the Reverend John Fincher from Quirindi, which is my home town.

He knew the value of education and research and encouraged it endlessly amongst his colleagues and his students.

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="117" SPEAKER="Tate Sen The Hon M.C." NAMEID="NJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NT">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator Tate</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Paragraph 56 of the Operational Guidelines adopted by the World Heritage Committee sets out the procedures for increasing an area already inscribed on the World Heritage List. An extension to a property is treated as a new nomination, unless the boundary change is, in the opinion of the World Heritage Bureau, a simple modification. Neither the Operational Guidelines nor the Convention specify procedures with respect to reduction of areas on the World Heritage List. As indicated in my answer to Question on Notice No. 1143, there is provision in the Operational Guidelines for removing a property altogether from the World Heritage List in two circumstances. The first is where the property has deteriorated to the extent that it has lost the characteristics which led to its inclusion on the World Heritage List. The second is where the property was under threat at the time of its nomination to the List and the necessary corrective measures to remove the threat have not been taken within the time allowed. A removal can take place if approved by a majority of two thirds of the World Heritage Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Australia re-nominated the entire Kakadu National Park in order to include Stage 3 of the Park on the World Heritage List. This is consistent with paragraph 56 of the Operational Guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention are adopted by the World Heritage Committee established under the World Heritage Convention. Articles 11.5 and 21.1 of the Convention require the World Heritage Committee to define the criteria on the basis of which a property may be included on the World Heritage List and the procedure for the grant of international assistance under the Convention. In fulfilment of these requirements, the Committee has adopted the Operational Guidelines for Implementation of the World Heritage Convention. Under Article 13.8 of the Convention, the Operational Guidelines are adopted by a majority of two-thirds of its members present and voting. There are 21 State members of the World Heritage Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Operational Guidelines are not binding on Australia. Nevertheless, as a matter of international law, they are evidence of the subsequent practice of the Parties in implementation of the World Heritage Convention and are able to be taken into account in the interpretation of it. There is no provision under the World Heritage Convention for Australia to formally accede to or ratify the Guidelines. Nor has Australia done so. Furthermore, there is no need for a Commonwealth Statute to apply the Operational Guidelines in Australia. The Operational Guidelines affect the Australian process of nominating properties to the World Heritage List. That process is carried out under the Executive power of the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Operational Guidelines were relied upon by Mason CJ and Brennan J of the High Court in Richardson v. Forestry Commission (1988) 164 CLR 261 at 295 and the basis for the Guidelines was referred to in the case stated to the High Court in Queensland v. the Commonwealth  (1988) 167 CLR 232 at 234. Perhaps the best statement of the purpose of the Guidelines is that set out in paragraph 4 of the current Guidelines. This provides:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"the operational guidelines which are set out below have been prepared for the purpose of informing States Parties to the Convention of the principles which guide the work of the Committee in establishing the World Heritage List and the List of World Heritage in Danger and in granting international assistance under the World Heritage Fund. These guidelines also provide details on other questions, mainly of a procedural nature, which relate to the implementation of the Convention."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The World Heritage Committee is appointed pursuant to Article 8 of the World Heritage Convention.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Criteria (a) to determine if a director's guarantee is required, the Department first considers the availability of alternative forms of security: corporate guarantee from a parent company or other financial guarantee. If none of these are available then a director's guarantee is considered if it is likely to contribute to the effectiveness of the contract.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) To determine if a bank or financial guarantee is required, the Department assesses a supplier's net worth (ie. extent to which liabilities exceed assets) and the working capital (ie. current assets against current liabilities). Net worth carries the most weight in determining the company's position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) (a) The Department did not seek directors' and or other financial guarantees for PE40, but sought financial guarantees from 45 tenderers for PE50.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) Of those who tendered and were asked for guarantees 16 were Australian owned business entities and 29 were overseas owned companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Yes, some tenderers were refused a place on PE50 because they were unlikely to achieve significant sales volume.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) No minimum threshold levels were used. Assessment was based on relative demand within the product ranges. For example, dollar value for sales of PC's would not be compared with sales of communications equipment because of the general difference in the unit values of the two classes of products; a successful supplier of communications equipment may sell less in value than a PC supplier whose product is considered not to be in demand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) The RFT, when circulated both in draft form and in its final form, stated that product demand under PE40, the previous contract, would be taken into account as would the representative range and number of products offered for PE50.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) As stated in my reply to the honourable senator's earlier question regarding "common user contracts" (No. 1479), the "contracts" to which he refers are not contracts in the strict legal sense. They are continuing offers by suppliers to supply goods or services at the price agreed and on specified terms and conditions if they are ordered by the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The terms of common use suppliers' continuing offers are not varied unilaterally by the Commonwealth. Variations must be agreed between the parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Department included in a letter of 24 October 1991 advice of its intention to vary the hours of operation to bring the arrangement into line with industry practice. The letter of 24 October did not in itself vary or attempt to vary unilaterally the terms of the suppliers' continuing offers. It sought agreement of the suppliers to the proposed variation. Following suppliers' agreement to the proposal, variations were effected by formal notice of amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Agreement of those already "on contract" to the proposed variation had to be given before the arrangements could be varied. With the exception of one company, all suppliers have agreed to the variation. Suppliers had the opportunity to amend prices based on the varied hours in accordance with the conditions of their contracts. The Commonwealth was not liable to pay "compensation".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The aspects of Commonwealth Purchasing Manual Chapter 13, Section 13 to which the honourable senator refers are matters of procedure, not matters of law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Administrative Arrangements Orders the Department of Administrative Services has a responsibility for "coordination of purchasing policy and civil purchasing". The Department issued the Commonwealth Purchasing Manual in 1984 as a source of advice and guidance for Commonwealth purchasing agencies. A Government Decision in December 1988 confirmed my Department's role as the central coordinating agency for purchasing policy and civil purchasing and expressly included control over purchasing of common use supplies as part of this role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) The Commonwealth Purchasing Manual is progressively being superseded by Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines, issued by my authority, and other guidance material issued by the Department of Administrative Services. Finance Regulation 42 provides that the Minister for Administrative Services may issue guidelines about the procurement of supplies and persons performing duties in relation to the procurement of supplies are required to have regard to these guidelines. Withdrawal of redundant parts of the Manual is notified to agencies by Commonwealth Procurement Circulars. There are no consequences in legal terms resulting from the withdrawal of parts of the Commonwealth Purchasing Manual.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) Those parts of the Commonwealth Purchasing Manual which have not been withdrawn are not delegated legislation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) There are approximately 20 different insecticidal chemicals, 18 herbicides and 6 defoliants/ conditioners which may be used on cotton. Without individual chemicals being identified it is not possible to list specific symptoms of exposure. However, of the 20 different insecticidal chemicals which may be used on cotton, these can be grouped structurally into four main types viz organophosphates, synthetic pyrethroids, carbamates and non-persistent organochlorines.</PARA>

Enquiries to the National Injury Surveillance Unit of the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services indicate that this type of data would be unlikely to be collected by their Injury Surveillance Information System and a search of that system showed nil incidence resulting from `injury' and `poisoning' or other exposure to chemical agents on cotton farms.</PARA>

The survey covered the period May 1983 to April 1988 and involved doctor's surgeries, hospital inpatient records and the NSW Department of Industrial Relations, Division of Occupational Health. The Study was undertaken to identify the degree to which accidental exposure with commonly used pesticides causes acute and chronic toxicity in the population of North-West New South Wales. Over the five year period 47 exposures were reported from doctor's surgeries of which 12 were hospitalised and 11 confirmed by pathology. Of the 47 exposures, 41 were occupational, 4 non-occupational and 2 not stated. Two of the non-occupational exposures were attributed to spray drift and 2 to childhood poisoning.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There does not seem to be a simple clear-cut answer to the Honourable Senator's question. The Commonwealth Government has not undertaken any studies of the economic impact of the $4 toll for trucks and heavy vehicles using the new F4 Motorway in Western Sydney, nor has it undertaken studies on the effect of the toll on industry and business in western Sydney. The Motorway is essentially a State responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However some things can be said about the new Motorway and its toll. There is a growing trend around the world for the private provision of public infrastructure. Given the budgetary constraints facing many governments, this trend means that citizens are often able to enjoy the benefits of increased and improved infrastructure earlier than they otherwise would. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As with any new infrastructure project, there will be costs as well as benefits to those affected by the Motorway. Drivers will need to decide whether to continue using the Great Western Highway, with its many traffic lights and difficulties, or to use the Motorway, pay the toll (I understand $1.50 for cars and $4 for trucks) and gain the benefits of large reductions in travel times and improved fuel efficiency from faster, steadier travel. Whichever decision drivers make, the end result will be a reduction in congestion and improved travel times, for those using the Motorway and for those using the Highway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, any extra impost is a burden on industry. However it is important to realise that drivers and businesses will not be made worse off by having this choice of route: they can continue to use the present Highway and other roads, or choose to obtain the benefits of the Motorway at a price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are potentially other benefits which will arise. Any development which can reduce the travel times to the western suburbs is likely to result in more economic activity in the area, with the land likely to become of higher value.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that my colleague Mr Carr has said that if he gains office in New South Wales, he will be acting to drop the toll on the F4 as well as a number of other tollways.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The claim in the report published by the Food Policy Alliance that only the equivalent of seven full time inspectors are responsible for monitoring imported foods is misleading. There are seven inspectors employed by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) to carry out point of entry checks on a number of foods deemed to be of particular risk by the National Food Authority (NFA). It is estimated that these risk categorised foods comprise about 10% of all food imports. All other imported foods are subject to point of sale checks by the State and Municipal health authorities. Arrangements exist for action to be taken by AQIS and NFA where significant instances of non-compliance with Australia's food safety requirement are reported by the States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Minister for Resources has advised that he does not accept the claim by the Food Policy Alliance that 100 full time inspectors are required to ensure an adequate level of surveillance of imported foods by AQIS at the point of entry. It is true that under the Government's fee for service policy, the costs of any additional inspectors would be recoverable from importers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The concerns raised by the Alliance and other groups concerned about the safety of imported foods are being taken into consideration by Government in a review of existing arrangements presently being undertaken. Any proposed changes will be consistent with the Government's plans to reform AQIS into a self funding agency on 1 July, 1993.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Methyl bromide is used by quarantine services in many countries to disinfest imported produce. It is a very useful fumigant which is lethal to a wide range of organisms and has a number of properties, such as, short exposure period, low toxicity to plants and relative ease of application, which make it an effective quarantine treatment.</PARA>

Similar concerns have been expressed by the US Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service which has called for a comprehensive review of the scientific data which led to the proposal to ban methyl bromide on the grounds that it is an ozone depletant.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) When RAN ships are "home ported" it means that they would expect to spend the time when they are not actually at sea in the harbour of that home port. This allows the families of married personnel to reside in the same location and enable non-duty personnel to go home to their family domicile on completion of the day's work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Service accommodation is therefore centred around the traditional home ports of Sydney for the majority of the Fleet, and Darwin or Cairns for the smaller patrol boat type vessels. More recently Rockingham/Perth in West Australia has become a significant home port as elements of the Fleet are home ported in the west under the Two Ocean Basing concept.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When a ship enters a period of extended maintenance then it will be unable to proceed to sea for lengthy periods. If the period of time alongside for maintenance, repair or overhaul away from the home-port extends beyond the normal entitlement for removal of the family, that is, approximately six months, then there will be a cost differential related to the requirement to:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) provide travel home to the family for the serviceman after a specified period if a removal entitlement is not established; or</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) provide alternate accommodation for personnel required to move ashore as on-board accommodation becomes inhabitable due to reduction of domestic facilities such as water, meals etc.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further costs associated with living out allowances where service accommodation is not available either for married or single personnel must be factored into the cost differential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By conducting the maintenance activity in the ship's home-port, costs associated with family entitlements for removals/travel etc are negated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of the single sailors sufficient service accommodation exists in the Sydney area to absorb much of this requirement. With single personnel making up a large proportion of the ship's company this cost will be quite significant away from established service support and facilities. It may mean purchase, albeit on a temporary basis, of sites such as motels to absorb this need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) It is in the national interest for Australia to maintain a naval ship building and repair industry which is efficient by world standards. This is best achieved by commercial competition under open tendering rather than by favouring any particular company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the experience gained by AMECON in constructing the last two FFGs and the ANZAC ships will assist the company in bidding competitively for major repair and maintenance work for these ships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) No cost/benefit analysis has yet been conducted on the merits of either company in regard to future repair and maintenance contracts. This will be part of the review process when tenders are let for the repair activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Ammunitioning/de-ammunitioning is normally conducted in Sydney harbour but at a specialised site away from the existing repair facility.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be possible to land ammunition at Point Wilson in Melbourne but this would necessitate the special handling equipment being transported to that site since it is not normally held on location.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's questions is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) In Australia, the National Food Authority (NFA) is responsible for advising the government on food safety issues. The NFA is currently developing guidelines for foods produced using genetic manipulation. The Authority is aware of overseas policy developments in genetic manipulation&mdash;not only in the US, but also in other countries such as the UK.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) I am aware that in the United States the recent statement by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has aroused some public debate. In Australia, the US decision received some media publicity (eg: <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, 27 May; <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Age</EMPHASIS>, 28 May; <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS>, 16 June). As I understand it, the US approach is to place on food producers legal obligation to ensure that the foods they offer consumers are safe and in compliance with applicable legal requirements, including a requirement to demonstrate to the FDA the safety of any new chemical additive. In the FDA's opinion, its existing pre and post-market evaluation powers, as well as the prospect of tort liability, are sufficient in ensuring food safety, including for products which may be the result of genetic modifications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The adequacy of the current non-statutory approach to the regulation of genetic manipulation has been the subject of a recent inquiry by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. The Committee's Report, entitled Genetic Manipulation: The Threat or the Glory was tabled in Parliament on 26 March 1992. It makes 48 recommendations concerning a range of issues relevant to regulating genetic manipulation. The report is now under close examination by officers within my Department and other Commonwealth Departments and agencies which have an interest in the regulation of biotechnology. Discussions are also taking place between the Commonwealth and the States and Territories. The issues raised by the report are complex and wide ranging and require thorough examination. I expect, however, to be able to respond to the report on behalf of the Government in the near future.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The overall ANZ content achieved in Project DESINE to 31 May 1992 was 24 percent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The intent of the contractual requirement to maintain the level of ANZ content was and is to ensure that local manufacturing industry continues to participate in the supply of equipment under the contract. The contractual arrangement of 53 percent ANZ content related only to the microcomputers originally supplied by MICA, an IBM subcontractor. The MICA operation proved incapable of coping with the volume and quality required by Defence, and was taken over by Techway and re-located to that company's factory at Penrith in mid 1989. Audits conducted by DAS in late 1989 and early 1990 established the ANZ content of the products supplied by Techway at levels relevant to the Penrith operation. These were included in the contract with effect from April 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The formula used by DAS to quantify the ANZ level is sensitive to a number of variables. For example, as the number of units produced increases, the amount of research and development and capital amortization costs included in the selling price of each unit typically reduces. This, together with any reductions in the cost of components and sub-assemblies, can reduce the measured ANZ content figure even though the actual level of local manufacturing industry participation may be unchanged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The audit completed by DAS in early 1990 showed that at the then scale of operation and then applicable factor costs, the formula would derive a weighted average ANZ content for Techway products of 30 percent. Accordingly, the contract authority accepted that level of ANZ content for Techway's products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The overall content actually achieved to the end of May 1992 was 24 percent. There is no reason to expect that this trend will change significantly during the remaining period of the contract.</PARA>

The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has functions under the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 in respect of the ICCPR, including the function of investigating any Commonwealth Act or practice which may be inconsistent with the rights recognised in the ICCPR as it applies in relation to Australia, that is, taking account of Australia's reservations to Articles 10, 14, and 20 of the ICCPR.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) A major and comprehensive United Kingdom review of the published research literature on `Screening for Osteoporosis to Prevent Fractures' was released in January 1992 (Effective Health Care, No. 1, Centre for Health Economics, University of York).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review concluded that bone density measurements are poor at identifying which women will go on to have a fracture in later life.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The long-term safety and effectiveness of HRT in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis amongst middle aged and older women is not known largely because adequate long range studies have not taken place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Bone densitometry has been promoted heavily as a means of screening for developing osteoporosis among menopausal women. As the answer to Question No (1) indicated, there is no conclusive evidence that bone densitometry is a good predictor of future risk of osteoporatic fracture, which is the major health problem arising from osteoporosis. Such evidence is necessary if bone densitometry is to be an effective screening, and hence preventive, tool for osteoporosis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Medicare benefits are not available for the measurement of bone mineral density for osteoporosis assessment. The Government's decision not to provide Medicare benefits for bone densitometry was based on advice from the Medicare Benefits Advisory Committee (MBAC). The MBAC is an independent statutory body, mainly composed of doctors, which advises the Minister on the application of Medicare benefits to specified services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In developing its advice, the MBAC considered a report by NHTAP on bone mineral assessment and osteoporosis. It concluded, in the light of the evidence available on the effectiveness of densitometry as a diagnostic tool, that Medicare benefits should not be paid for bone densitometry screening for osteoporosis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NHTAP has since provided another report acknowledging further development of bone densitometry technology for specific purposes, but not recommending its use for screening. </PARA>

The provision of bone densitometry for the management of patients with specific conditions is one of the issues being considered closely in the development of the policy.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Government has given a high priority to the area of child care funding for TAFE throughout Australia. This commitment is part of the Government's social justice strategy and the results of this activity have been excellent. Since its inception in 1989, $10 million has been provided to assist in constructing or extending 39 child care centres to create 1,100 additional child care places for TAFE students. In addition, approval has been given for $3 million for each of the next two years to provide further assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The primary objective of grants to provide additional child care places in TAFE is to remove one of the barriers to the participation of women undertaking training and in preparation for re-entry to the workforce. Government policies reflecting child care needs and priorities have been determined with this in mind. In respect to child care at Fremantle, a grant of $200,000 has been approved in 1992 for the establishment of a new 47 place child care centre for TAFE students. This project will be completed in 1993.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes. An evaluation of the Australian Country Information Service Trial (ACIS) was printed in March 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Government's allocation for ACIS was $1.85 million across three years, including the trial period. Program management arrangements, administrative procedures and financial arrangements varied somewhat between the different categories of site, which means that the actual cost of operating each site over the last two years is difficult to ascertain exactly. Therefore I have provided estimated expenditure for the different categories of site used during the trial (see Attachment A). This includes the initial Commonwealth allocation for the trial, as well as additional funding provided under the Department of Primary Industries and Energy's Rural Access Program and by the Department of Employment, Education and Training to allow sites to continue operating after the completion of the trial period, pending a government decision on the future of the service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) No funding allocated through the 1989 Cabinet Decision has been withdrawn. The ACIS Trial has now concluded and funds have been expended in accordance with the terms of the Trial. Decisions have not been made by Government on continuation of any service at existing sites, or establishment of new sites. However, I agreed to allocate additional funding under the Rural Access Program to allow the continued operation of local government sites (Newman in Western Australia, Hughenden in Queensland and Brewarrina in New South Wales) and the site operated by a community group at Lameroo in South Australia until 30 September 1992, pending a Government decision on the future of the service. Additional funding has also been approved for up to five of Australia Post sites to continue operating until this time. The decision as to which Australia Post sites will be continued will be negotiated with Australia Post. The Departments of Employment, Education and Training, and Social Security closed their sites on 30 June.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The three sites referred to had not been advised of likely funding for 1992-93 and beyond as of the date of the honourable senator's question.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The ABT's preliminary view released on 17 December 1992 was that both 2LM Lismore, and 2MW in the adjacent Murwillumbah service area, would retain their commercial viability if a new licence were granted in Lismore. However, in the light of additional economic and financial evidence presented at the Lismore licence hearing in March 1992, the ABT changed its preliminary view and in its decision and report, released on 13 May 1992, concluded that a new commercial FM service would make the existing service, 2LM, commercially unviable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This decision followed a thorough analysis of the Lismore market, its radio revenue potential and the expenditure required to generate that revenue. The additional evidence which the Tribunal accepted is as follows: financial data from the 1990-91 financial year, which showed a continuing decline in the revenue generated in the Lismore radio market; the impact of television aggregation (which commenced in the area after the publication of the preliminary view), in causing a loss of revenue from radio to television; the need, in a competitive market, for increased expenditure by 2LM on promotions and advertising and the limited capacity of the licensee to further reduce staffing costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Correspondence between the then Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Richardson) and Mr Peter Westerway, Chairman of the ABT, had no bearing on the outcome of the Inquiry. On 20 February 1992 the Minister wrote to the Chairman seeking his views on the practicability of joining an inquiry into the grant of a supplementary licence for Richmond River Broadcasters with its Inquiry into the grant of a new commercial radio licence to serve Lismore. In his response Mr Westerway noted that the ABT can, and has in the past, joined supplementary licence and new commercial licence grant inquiries. However, Richmond River Broadcasters' referred application was not received by the ABT until 19 May 1992 after the Lismore new licence grant inquiry was concluded, on 13 May 1992.</PARA>

Richmond River Broadcasters lodged an application with the Department of Transport and Communications on 31 March 1992. Senator Richardson referred Richmond River Broadcasters' Supplementary licence application to the ABT within 5 weeks from his receipt of the application on 8 April 1992.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) Departmental advice recommending that the supplementary licence application be referred to the ABT was forwarded to the Minister for Transport and Communications on 8 April 1992.

The remaining 22% have familial short stature and the effect of growth hormones on these children is presently under review by the Growth Hormone Advisory Committee of the Australian Paediatric Endocrine Group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) Yes. However, new Guidelines for the use of growth hormones were introduced on 1 January 1992, which tightened eligibility criteria. Furthermore, a conference attended by top Endocrinologists and Paediatricians from all over Australia was held in Canberra at the end of May this year and all aspects of the scheme were discussed. The analysis of data from the new OZGROW data base set up in 1989 and funded by the Department was presented. Most patients receiving growth hormone are now entered on this data base, and trends in use and response to treatment were demonstrated. The Growth Hormone Advisory Committee is currently considering the need for any changes to the Guidelines in view of the discussions at that conference.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The study suggested that patients with mild to moderate asthma who used inhaled fenoterol (BEROTEC) at fixed intervals throughout the day had poorer control of their condition than those who used bronchodilators on an irregular, "as-needed" basis.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator Robert Ray</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Under arrangements established since January 1977, any use of Australian Defence Force (ADF) loan or exchange personnel serving with the Papua New Guinea Defence Force (PNGDF) in politically sensitive situations requires consultation with Australian authorities. As the dispute on Bougainville has been of this nature, visits by ADF personnel on loan or exchange with the PNGDF have been restricted to those occasions in which the personnel were required to perform technical functions for the PNGDF which it was unable to carry out for itself. There has been no direct ADF involvement in mounting or participating in PNGDF operations on Bougainville. The attached table lists visits to Bougainville by ADF loan or exchange personnel in performance of their normal duties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the above, ADF members on the staff of the Australian High Commission as accredited diplomatic representatives to PNG also visited Bougainville in performance of their diplomatic duties, and to assist with the Australian High Commission's consular responsibilities for the safety and welfare of Australian residents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Australia agreed in 1989 to provide helicopter pilot training to PNGDF personnel of a mutually determined nature. The training has involved conversion of qualified fixed-wing pilots to rotary wing, conversion of pilots to the UH-1H Iroquois, and a period of on-the-job experience with 171 Command and Liaison Squadron in the Australian Army Aviation Regiment. Two pilots have finished this training as of July 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Since Independence, the ADF has provided training assistance to the PNGDF under Defence Cooperation. This training has not been provided for any specific contingency but rather against the full range of needs of the PNGDF. Since the start of the Bougainville dispute, Defence Cooperation training has included training of PNGDF recruits, and a number of specialist/technical military courses conducted in PNG. In addition, sub-unit training was conducted for four companies of 1st Battalion, Royal Pacific Islands Regiment of the PNGDF at the Australian Army Land Warfare Centre at Canungra from March to June 1992. This consisted of standard ADF military skills training, including map reading, navigation, patrolling, movement and living in the field, watermanship, leadership, orders, and physical fitness, but did not as such constitute training in jungle warfare. I have no doubt PNGDF personnel trained in Australia have taken part in military operations in Bougainville. The use of PNGDF service personnel, however, is solely a matter for the PNG Government and I am not privy to information relating to the deployment of PNGDF personnel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The RAAF has not transported PNGDF personnel either to North Solomons Province (Bougainville) nor to Solomon Islands during the dispute.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth has had concerns regarding the safety and efficacy of oral procaine hydrochloride preparations such as KH3 for many years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This drug is not a vitamin. It has been promoted as being effective in the treatment of the symptoms of ageing. In 1975, the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC), an independent body of experts, recommended that KH3 not be permitted to be marketed in Australia on the grounds that there was no evidence to support the claims made for the product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite this recommendation, the company concerned continued to manufacture and market the drug in Australia. As the Commonwealth only had power to regulate imported therapeutic goods, no action could be taken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the introduction of the new Therapeutic Goods Act, the Commonwealth assumed responsibility for ensuring the quality, safety and efficacy of all pharmaceuticals in Australia, whether produced locally or overseas. An application to register KH3 on the new Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods under the provisions of the new Act was made by the company concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In view of ADEC's previous concerns the company was asked by the Department to provide scientific data to support the safety and efficacy of the product prior to it being registered. The data provided by the company were insufficient to demonstrate the drug's safety and efficacy for the proposed indications. The drug was therefore denied registration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The company was offered the opportunity of having this decision reviewed by ADEC. However, I understand that the company's marketing agreement with the German manufacturer of the product has now been terminated and that it no longer intends to pursue the matter.</PARA>
