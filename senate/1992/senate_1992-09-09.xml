We would have been amazed had it not been moved because in the discussion of the Select Committee on Sales Tax Legislation on the Bills Senator McMullan did say that no guillotine would apply to the further consideration of these Bills.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McMullan has not read any press reports saying that the coalition will be filibustering these Bills. We have been at strenuous pains to say quite the contrary. What we have said is that these Bills, on the Government's own statement when they were originally introduced, represent the most significant changes to the sales tax legislation since its original introduction in 1930 and that, on those grounds alone, these Bills therefore require proper and due consideration in the Senate. That was why the Senate set up a select committee to look at them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Select Committee's work was cut from beneath it in many important respects by a statement by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) at 6 p.m. on the night before the Senate Select Committee was due to consider some of the 150 submissions it had received expressing concern about these Bills. The Treasurer put out a statement absolutely emasculating six of the key areas that the Bills were dealing with in the Government's so-called attempt to simplify the sales tax legislation. Those amendments are now in the Senate. They require, as does the general concept behind the whole simplification exercise, very detailed and proper consideration if we are to do our duty as elected members of the Australian Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Hill) moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of the Senate or to provide for the consideration of any other matter.</PARA>
<PARA>Yesterday I gave notice of a motion to move that the Senate chamber be furnished with the Australian flag in a manner which is in keeping with the proportions and architecture of the chamber, to give a permanent outward sign of allegiance which we all owe the nation of Australia; to show respect for the commitment Australian men and women have demonstrated to the Australian flag throughout the history of Australia both in times of peace and war, and now as the unifying symbol for our sports people in the international arena; and to demonstrate that the Senate is proud to display the Australian flag. The final paragraph of the motion seeks to ensure that the flag be installed in the chamber within three weeks of the motion being carried. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This parliamentary building has been in use for over four years. This must be the only parliamentary chamber in the world that does not have its national emblem displayed proudly. After four years it is time for us to declare whether or not we want the flag in this chamber. The National Party and the Liberal Party have 100 per cent support for prominently displaying our national symbol in this chamber. We have a national symbol flying over this Parliament and we have two national symbols in the House of Representatives, yet this chamber is devoid of our national emblem. I think it is a shame, my colleagues think it is a shame and they think that it has gone on for too long. After four years it is time we made a decision. Not only do we think that this chamber should have a flag but also 64 per cent of the Australian people want to retain the Australian flag. I think the Senate should listen to the wishes of those people and display the flag in our chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the past few months since Mr Keating was appointed Prime Minister we have seen him try to denigrate the Australian flag. We have seen him trying to use it as a diversion and a subterfuge to dismiss the problems of Australia's financial security. He has used it to divert attention from the needs of Australia. That will not wash. It is up to the Labor Party to support the Australian flag on a vote or to vote against it. But I tell honourable senators opposite that if they vote today against the Australian flag going into this chamber, the wrath of the people of Australia will come down on them. This will be the time when they either put up or shut up. The people of Australia are looking. The Labor Party cannot hide one way and divert the other way. It cannot go out and say that we should not have an Australian flag and then we should have an Australian flag. Senator Loosley says that we should get off the subject of the Australian flag. We want to know where the Labor Party stands. This will be the acid test for it today. Not only will it be an acid test, but also the Labor Party will be under the spotlight of Australia. It will be caught today, whether it is for or against the flag. Today it will be seen for what it is. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If anyone had listened to Senator Boswell's speech they would not have realised that he was moving a contingent notice of motion to suspend Standing Orders to discuss an urgent motion. One would have thought that he was entering the general flag debate. What Senator Boswell has moved today and what he has said in his comments is a condemnation of several hundred senators in the past. If, as he is saying, this matter is of such urgency, why has something not been done about it over the past 91 years? I am not going to speak today, right now, about the subject matter of whether we should have an Australian flag on display in this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under Standing Orders opportunity is given to Opposition senators to bring up during General Business any matter they regard as being of high priority and to carry whatever motion they like. But it is interesting that no-one else&mdash;all those patriots who have served in this chamber for the last 91 years&mdash;has had to prove his patriotism by putting up a flag. They have always been patriots. They have always been great Australians and they do not need cheap chauvinistic tactics to prove it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today the Leader of the National Party in this chamber, who is not trusted with a front bench portfolio, is not putting before us trade issues as the most urgent matter. He wants to raise an issue of putting one symbol here. We have a symbol here. Whether we have another symbol will not be of great moment to the Australian people. But Senator Boswell, the man who walked into the party room, talked tough on sugar and then tugged the forelock and crawled to the rest of his Liberal colleagues and gave in, wants a diversionary tactic today. He wants a diversionary tactic because those opposite are all over the place on Opposition policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The good old boys of the National Party do not want the GST. But the one thing they want more than anything is ministerial office. So they go along with the GST and sell out their traditional supporters. They sell them out on sugar&mdash;we are going to get a zero tariff policy. So in comes a diversion. They do not know whether they are Arthur or Martha on trade policies. One of them is going off talking to Major. Others are going off to join the North American trade zone. They do not know where they are on policy, so they look for a diversion. And what could be a better diversion than to say, `We want this Senate to suspend all other business to discuss for the first time in 91 years whether we show the Australian flag in this chamber'. Well, Senator Boswell, that diversion will not work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will be quite happy to go out to the rural areas of Australia and say, `Your most senior representative in the Senate did not suspend Standing Orders to discuss tax policy, did not suspend Standing Orders to talk about the sugar tariff, did not suspend Standing Orders to talk about wheat, but in a cheap and absolutely pathetic way decided to come in here with a diversion today'. Senator Boswell has the opportunity to raise this motion during General Business if he is given priority to do so by his coalition colleagues&mdash;and they shudder every time he gets to his feet. He has had that chance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Seeing that Senator Boswell is so fired up these days, why does he not come in with another motion and also add the knighthood issue. He wants to go back to the grovelling imperial system of honours so that he and the good old boys of the National Party can start giving out British honours. At least they will give them out for free now because we are on to them. They will not be able to sell the old knighthoods for fundraising&mdash;the good old boys from the National Party going back into the nineteenth century, tugging their forelocks to the empire. That describes absolutely what they are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a diversion. They spend all their time at the State council meetings discussing who is going to be Lord this or Sir that. Do not worry about the farmers that they are supposed to represent; do not worry about the sugar growers that they have sold out; do not worry about any of these people. Come in here and run a useless diversion and then run out and say to the electorate, `We are more patriotic'. Well, patriotism is the way in which one serves the country, not the way in which symbols are put up. It has nothing to do with the chauvinistic cliches that those opposite go on with. It is to do with how one helps and develops the country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have been in this building for four years. We are debating the question of the flag because this country's Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has denigrated our most potent national symbol in a foreign nation and made it an issue in an attempt to divert attention away from the state of the economy. That is what this Prime Minister has done. He cringes away from things which are Australian. So Senator Boswell today has moved a perfectly proper motion to remedy the fact that there is no flag in this chamber. Very simply, all Senator Ray had to do was acquiesce in the formal motion. He did not have to say a word. All he had to say was, `Yes, the motion can be formal', and the flag would have been in this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to relate that the President of this chamber gives me a sense of pride in that he has chosen to have his portrait painted with our flag in that portrait. Yet this spineless band opposite wants to hear the Minister for Defence tell his troops that he is ashamed of the Australian national flag. He will not have it in this chamber because he will not agree to simply having a motion declared formal.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a moment we will hear bit more vitriol from the lovely Senator Schacht who spends more time out of this country than he does in it. He has no time for conventions or the things that are important to this country, so we expect a predictable speech from him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two more things to say. This Labor lot is out of step with former Labor leaders. Bert Evatt described it as the most beautiful flag in the world; Arthur Calwell described it as attracting the proper respect which would, indeed, mean that people would follow the laws of this country. But the quote I like best is the one that came from an old digger who served this country well. In a letter which I received, he wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My dear mates who died in the Battalion would not believe what has happened. I do not whinge. My sense of humour overcomes pain, but I ask you now, do not add insult to my injuries, by abolishing the symbol which represents the spiritual qualities which invest a nation with nobility and integrity.</PARA>
<PARA>All Senator Ray had to do, to acknowledge that old digger's sacrifice for this land, was agree to a formal motion that said that our Australian national flag could be seen in this chamber here, but he and his Prime Minister have chosen to denigrate our flag and all it stands for.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is useful to drag this debate to what it is really about, that is, the suspension of Standing Orders. It is not, as has already been pointed out, about the flag or even whether we should have a flag in this chamber, although that is the substance of the substantive motion. Most people in this chamber should know that there is a recognised procedure by which motions are made formal, and that is that the Whips are notified and everybody is informed beforehand as to the intention of the mover of the motion. I understand that in this case that did not happen. The Government was not informed and was therefore taken by surprise in relation to this motion. For that reason, it is inappropriate that we suspend Standing Orders and accord this motion the importance of a full debate when there are so many other important things ready to be handled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In looking at the motion&mdash;and I pointed this out to Senator Boswell when he brought the motion to me yesterday&mdash;we see that it talks about this chamber being furnished with `an Australian flag'.

The motion would be quite consistent with the flag being changed and then appearing in this chamber. So the nonsense that Senator Bishop went on with is totally irrelevant, either to the suspension of Standing Orders or even to the substantive motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our party room this morning, we considered the suspension of Standing Orders in order to debate a far more important issue&mdash;Senator Spindler's motion&mdash;which sought to do something very positive and very direct about the attack on Australia's trade in relation to wheat, using the US bases as a bargaining chip. That is something which I think most people would agree is a far more significant and far more important issue at the present time than whether we have a flag of whatever sort in this chamber. We chose not to seek to make that motion formal or indeed to suspend Standing Orders to debate that issue because, even with that important issue, we thought there were still far more important things which needed to be debated in this chamber today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frankly, I find the motion as it stands&mdash;the substantive motion&mdash;substantially innocuous. It does not identify which flag we may have at some future time. It talks about `an Australian flag'. Questions of the architecture of the place and the appropriateness of the colours of the flag in this chamber would have to be considered and, indeed, as the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray), who is in the chamber, has pointed out, if it were so urgent why in over 91 years have we not had a flag in this chamber. </PARA>

The reason advanced for not supporting this motion&mdash;the reason we have just heard for not wanting to choose to put an Australian flag in this chamber&mdash;is simply that there was some sort of procedural defect and that because the Government was not given notice of the intention to declare this motion formal they will not support a suspension of Standing Orders.</PARA></TALK.START>

But what sort of Australians are those opposite if they do not believe in an Australian flag being in the Senate chamber? What sort of cringing people are they if they do not believe in displaying the prime emblem of our nation in this place?

<PARA>If ever there was an example for the New Zealand delegation present here today of the value of a house of review, I think the issue which is before us is such an example. I rise to speak today to my motion to disallow instrument No. 2 of 1992 relating to Defence Force superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I first learnt about this rule change to the military superannuation benefits scheme back in June and it concerned me when I heard about it. I sought advice and clarification from the Department, but the events that unfolded as a result led me to believe that something was seriously wrong. This belief has been confirmed by many detailed letters which I have received from defence personnel setting out their personal circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the regulation were allowed to pass, approximately 2,048 defence personnel in a buy-back of service situation would have a portion of their own contributions stay in Consolidated Revenue rather than being transferred into the new military superannuation benefits scheme. Defence personnel currently have until 30 September to decide whether to stay in the old scheme, the DFRDB, or to transfer to the new scheme, the MSBS, in much the same way that Commonwealth public servants had to make a choice in July last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">DFRDB is quite unique as far as superannuation schemes go. A compulsory 5.5 per cent of salary is paid by defence members, not into a fund like the public servants schemes but into Consolidated Revenue where the Government has full use of the money. Members who leave the forces before completing 20 years of service receive only their own contributions without any interest and without any employer contribution. They are required to take them; there are no rollover provisions in the Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a service man or woman leaves after 10 years and then decides to rejoin the forces, he or she has the opportunity to buy back that previous 10 years of service with extra contributions from his or her salary. The Act says that this will be at a rate of 2.75 per cent. So, in sum, they will be paying 8.25 per cent of their salary to superannuation: 5.5 per cent for current service and 2.75 per cent for buy-back of previous service. One must remember that they have never had anything from the Government or any interest on that money, so they are not in a double-dipping situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Sir William Cole committee, set up in June 1990 to review DFRDB, decided that as a scheme it was too difficult to convert to a proper defined benefit funded scheme and recommended that a new scheme be developed to accommodate all the requirements of the occupational superannuation standards. The Cole report also stated&mdash;this is a very important matter&mdash;that a defence member with a buy-back entitlement should be treated with equity in relation to a member who has had continuous service. This rule change would mean that personnel with buy-back entitlements would not be treated with equity in relation to a member who had had continuous service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The MSBS was introduced in April 1991 and both DFRDB members with continuous service and those with a buy-back entitlement became eligible to transfer, except that the ones with the buy-back entitlements must finish contributing all that they need to in order to have completely bought back their previous service. If they do this and transfer to MSBS, they will, like all Commonwealth public servants, receive an employer benefit for their entire time of service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government decided in October last year that those who had a buy-back entitlement but had not yet finished the process could catch up by buying the buy-back in lump sum form instead of by contributions. This was to enable those who wished to transfer to MSBS to have all of their service counted for the notional employer benefit MSBS was set up to provide. Remember also that the buy-back contribution lump sums are paid into Consolidated Revenue, not into a super fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some have paid for their lump sum buy-back with savings, others with a personal bank loan. Some have chosen to offset the balance of what they need to have finished buying back with the total amount that they have contributed during the second period of service. But all have put their own money into DFRDB and bought back their previous service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This rule change, made in May this year, will effectively say that, retrospectively, any lump sum contributions made since October last year will now be treated as debt to the Commonwealth, will stay in Consolidated Revenue and will not be transferred over to the new scheme. There are about 2,048 people in this situation, and if their money stays in Consolidated Revenue it will mean a windfall gain to the Commonwealth of approximately $12m to revenue. That is $12m paid by service men and women from their own resources&mdash;$12m which would have remained credited to their names in the DFRDB scheme to be paid back to them eventually from Consolidated Revenue on their retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For people leaving after less than 20 years service, those DFRDB contributions will be all that they receive&mdash;no employer benefit at all. By transferring to the new superannuation scheme they will lose their money. The argument in support of the rule change says that there is windfall gain to the member, an argument which does not stand up to close scrutiny. In fact, advice from the Economics and Commerce Group of the Parliamentary Library confirms this. In the paper provided to me it was stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DFRDB members purchasing past service with outstanding debt effectively have their transfer value reduced by $2 for every $1 balance of outstanding debt.</PARA>
<PARA>This is not, I would think, intended policy. Rather, it reflects from an accounting and actuarial perspective a poorly defined transfer value. Further, the paper from the Parliamentary Library said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The instrument made by the Minister under subsection 1(5)(i) of the MSBS Act will not remedy the anomaly. Rather, it will remove the opportunity for DFRDB members purchasing past service who repay their debt to be placed in the same position as DFRDB members with continuous service. This creates a further anomaly.</PARA>
<PARA>This advice has not been discredited by anyone. I gave that advice to Senator Ray's office. As I told the Minister two months ago and confirmed to him in my letter of 30 June, I did not wish to make this matter a public issue. MSBS, the new scheme, is an excellent scheme for the majority of defence personnel and I did not wish to frighten those who should transfer to it. So I went to Minister Ray with my concerns in June, having had difficulty with Minister Bilney's office. I appreciate the fact that Minister Ray took the matter seriously and, as a result, had the matter referred to the Australian Government Actuary. But, being a personnel issue, his office then handed back the issue to Minister Bilney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My staff member spoke to the Government Actuary early in July and he indicated that he had already looked at the matter and responded on 2 July. My office tried to get hold of his report from Minister Bilney's office, but to no avail. Throughout July and August, Minister Bilney's office kept saying that it was coming. But it never did. Not until mid-August, having once again telephoned Senator Ray's office, did I receive the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report was accompanied by a letter from Minister Bilney indicating that the Actuary was taking a further look at the matter. Despite several phone calls and messages to the Actuary, we were not able to secure his final report until just before the debate on this disallowance motion was due to take place in the last sitting session. For this reason I agreed to postpone the debate on the disallowance motion. I was reluctant to do this due to the imminent commencement of the MSBS scheme at the end of September and because this matter could not wait any longer, as servicemen only have until then to join the new scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Actuary's second report points out that there is no unintended windfall to the serviceman, which is the reason put forward by the Government as justification for the regulation. The second report of the Actuary, however, also points out that the view held by the Opposition and the Parliamentary Library on the rule change is reasonably held, and Minister Ray has accepted this advice. I must say in passing, however, that if I were in business and had asked the Actuary for a report on which I intended to act, I would have refused to pay the bill for the report. It can be fairly criticised, I think, for trying to have two bob each way and being a pretty inadequate basis for ministerial decision making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, I am glad to say that Minister Ray has now advised me that he will not be opposing the disallowance and will be recommending to the MSBS trustees that a further rule change be introduced to ensure that those who have already made their decision, vis-a-vis a transfer from DFRDB to MSBS, will be treated equitably. We will, of course, as I said to the Minister, scrutinise the new rule when it comes before the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do welcome the Minister's wise and proper decision and I commend him for his readiness to have this matter properly investigated. But there is, sadly, more to be said about this issue. I think fellow senators and the Minister for Defence, Senator Ray, will be appalled to learn of some of the backroom behaviour that took place in trying to ensure that this rule change went through come hell or high water. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no doubt that Minister Bilney may not be on top of the intricacies of superannuation. However, on his staff he has Mr Finnegan, whom one would expect to know all about superannuation because he comes from the human resources area of the Defence Department. He went through the revolving door and came back into the Department as a consultant to the new military superannuation implementation team. He is now in the Minister's office as senior adviser. A former colleague of Mr Finnegan is Mr Peter Skinner, who is head of the MSBS implementation team. Mr Skinner, incidentally, has recently been appointed Deputy Commissioner to the Retirement Benefits Office and an alternate member of the MSBS board of trustees. I am seriously concerned about this appointment. As a trustee, he has a compelling legal duty to protect the members of his trust. I fear that Mr Skinner does not appear to understand this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my belief that Mr Skinner, as head of the MSBS implementation team, has wrongfully and wilfully advised the Government that these bona fide superannuation contributions from 2,048 defence service personnel should not be credited to them and should remain in Consolidated Revenue. I can only speculate that Mr Skinner started off by making an honest mistake, which he then tried to cover up by his subsequent behaviour. This advice was accepted by Minister Bilney's office, but I cannot be sure whether the Minister knew the entire story. I suspect that he might have been informed on a need to know basis. I understand that this matter was handled by Mr Finnegan, Mr Skinner and Mr Alan Thompson, First Assistant Secretary, Human Resources and Management Division, and by the Assistant Chief of Personnel, Rear Admiral Stubington. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also dissatisfied that Sir William Cole, as Chairman of the board of trustees, refused to have the matter reviewed or re-looked at when it was put to him by the military representatives on the board. The need for independence of the Chairman from the Public Service and from the Department is obviously essential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleagues would be aware that I am rarely given to strong and extreme language, but the developments that occurred in relation to this issue compel me to speak out. I suspected that something was very wrong when Mr Finnegan directed my research officer not to speak about the matter with anybody in the Department of Defence except Mr Skinner. A letter to the same effect was promptly received at my office. This was despite an earlier arrangement, which had been working for some time with Senator Ray, that my office could go direct to the Department for advice when necessary. </PARA>

I requested a briefing on Commonwealth superannuation generally from the office of the Minister for Finance. This appeared to be acceptable and then was mysteriously refused. That brief was eventually given after I complained to Senator Ray.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot understand why Mr Finnegan and Mr Skinner did not realise that their actions were not consistent with the behaviour of people with nothing to worry about.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My suspicions were confirmed when I came across a document written by Mr Finnegan and faxed from Minister Bilney's office to Mr Thompson, the First Assistant Secretary in the Department.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ACPERS told me the other day that he intends to seek a follow on opinion from the Actuary. I was not clear on what point. Perhaps you might check with him as we don't want egg on our collective face over this issue.</PARA>

<PARA>Ministers have to rely on their advisers and they expect that advice to be the right advice. Ministers are not well served by only being give one opinion when there is more than one view on important issues. A smothering of one opinion and a closing of access to information serves only those who are trying to further their own agenda. How can any Minister, Labor or Liberal, rely on the advice of people such as these?<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only recently, former Labor Minister Clyde Holding in an article on defence management said, `How can you govern a country with bastards like that running the Department?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said at the beginning, I was disappointed that it had to get to this stage. I had hoped the matter would have been speedily resolved but I did not anticipate the determination of some public servants to cover their backs and their tracks, as has happened in this case. I cannot understand why they have been carrying on with all this Keystone cop activity. I will not be snowed or misled by members of the Public Service, particularly when the rights and well-being of our defence forces are at stake. But nor can I condone the misleading of a Senate committee by a Minister of the Crown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the Senate's attention to a letter signed by Minister Bilney on 21 August to the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. The purpose of the letter was to answer concerns of the Committee in relation to this rule change. The Minister wrote two pages of justification and explanation. But he attached to his letter by way of supporting evidence the report from the Government Actuary. Unfortunately, however, the report that he attached was dated 2 July&mdash;that is, it was the first report from the Government Actuary. But at the time Minister Bilney sent that letter to the Committee, he had already received the second report from the Government Actuary dated 19 August but in fact delivered to my office by Steven Duffy of Minister Bilney's office on 18 August. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So irrespective of whether it was 18 or 19 August, the Minister wrote that letter to the Regulations and Ordinances Committee on 21 August. He concealed from that Committee the fact that there was a second report in which the Government Actuary had changed his advice. It is on the basis of that second report that Minister Ray is prepared not to oppose the disallowance motion. I find it totally unacceptable that this Senate could accept such action from a Minister of the Crown. Clearly there has been an attempt to mislead a Senate committee&mdash;a most important committee because it plays such an important role in protecting the rights of citizens. I draw that matter to the attention of the Chairman of the Regulations and Ordinance Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I intend to disallow all four points in the instrument, even though the matter I have spoken about relates only to the second point. The reason for this is that under the Act any rule changes to the MSBS Act are required to go before the board of trustees before being implemented. I am informed that Mr Skinner did not put the other three items before the board, and this was confirmed last night at a Senate Estimates committee meeting. Mr Skinner has no right to make changes to a superannuation scheme that affects the futures of many people, without putting them before the board of trustees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recognise that the board insisted that such action should not occur again and that Mr Skinner apologised. Nevertheless, Mr Skinner is now Deputy Commissioner of the Retirement Benefits Office and an alternate member of the MSBS board of trustees. He is not a clerk. As a result of his behaviour over this whole issue, I have serious concerns about these appointments. His conduct leaves many serious questions unanswered and he appears to have inadequate concern for the well-being of the very defence personnel for whom he holds a trust. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Being a trustee is a most serious and important appointment and one which is covered by an important body of our laws. Great care must be taken in making such appointments, and trustees must be subject to close and continuing scrutiny as they fulfil their positions of trust. The conduct of those associated with this rule change is a cause for serious concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I move this motion to disallow, I once again welcome the fact that Minister Ray, having given the matter close attention, as I asked him to, will not be opposing the motion. He understands that he has an important responsibility to Australian service men and women and that their confidence in their new superannuation scheme must not be undermined by Government action. </PARA>

This issue is one of the fairness of regulations concerning the military superannuation schemes. Under the current Defence Force retirement and death benefits scheme, members who leave the service of the defence forces and take a refund of their superannuation contributions but subsequently rejoin the services may buy back their superannuation entitlements to the previous period of service.

That is, existing members would have the option of transferring from the existing system to the new system if they so elected.

That is, the value of repurchased service must also be taken into account in the calculation of the transfer value, otherwise the member will be extremely and unfairly disadvantaged.

The unfairness of the formula used to calculate a member's transfer value can lead to the loss of thousands of dollars of equity in the MSBS. The recent rule change by the MSBS Board of Trustees only compounds the inequity. My own situation is a case in point.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am a member of the ADF with over 11 years service. That period of service comprises a previous period of seven years and a current period of four and a half years. When I reentered the ADF on 11 January 1988 I elected to have the previous period of service recognised as a period of qualifying service, as was my right under Section 64(1) of the DFRDB Act. I effected purchase of that previous service by fortnightly instalments in accordance with the provisions of Sections 64(2) and 126(1) of the DPRDB Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My concern is that, should I elect to transfer from the DFRDB Scheme to the MSBS, I would be doubly debited for the amount of the outstanding balance of the buy back price of my previous period of service. This constitutes a substantial financial loss and creates an inequity that is contrary to the DFRDB Review Board's principle that equity must be preserved and that the transfer arrangements should not disadvantage members.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would be useful to demonstrate this inequity by way of example.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My 11+ years of service comprises a previous period of 7 years and a current period of 4+ years. DFRDB contributions for the current period amount to $10,017. Purchase price of the previous 7 years of service amounts to S16,789. Of this amount $3,899 has been repaid through fortnightly instalments, leaving an outstanding balance of $12,890. The notional interest entitlement for NSBS transfer purposes amounts to $3,079.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the outstanding balance had been repaid in full (either by payment of the last instalment or by a lump sum payment of any</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">outstanding amount) prior to the rule change in May this year, my DFRDB account balance on transfer to MSBS would have been as follows;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Case 1&mdash;Payment by instalments completed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DFRDB contributions for the current period (a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> $10,017</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Additional contributions for previous service (b) $16,789</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Notional interest (c) $3,079</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Account balance (a+b+c) $29,885</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Case 2&mdash;Payment of outstanding balance by lump sum payment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DFRDB contributions for the current period (a) $10,017</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Additional contributions for previous service (b) $3,899</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">lump sum payment of outstanding balance (c) $12,890</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Notional interest (d) $3,079</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Account balance (a+b+c+d) $29,885</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In both cases I consider that the account balance accurately and fairly represents my contributions to, and hence my equity in, the superannuation scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now the MSBS transfer provisions allow a member to offset any outstanding balance on the purchase of previous service against credit in his/her DFRDB account. This is to facilitate the clearance of any debt prior to entry to the MSBS. While this is commendable in principle, the formula used to apply the offset and hence calculate the transfer value, unfairly penalises the members by doubly debiting them for the amount of the outstanding balance. Applied to my situation the account balance, or MSBS transfer value, as determined by the transfer formula becomes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DFRDB contributions for current period (a) $10,017 </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Additional contributions for previous service (b) $3,899</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Notional interest (c) $3,079</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Less outstanding balance on previous service (d) $12,890</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Account balance (a+b+c-d) $4,105</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This calculation shows that the outstanding balance on previous service has been paid out but clearly, does not show that the value of the previous service purchased has not been fully recognised. Indeed, I have purchased previous service to the value of $16,789 (comprising $3,899 paid by instalments and $12,890 paid from existing DFRDB contribution credits) but only $3,899 is recognised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The equitable way to determine the transfer value is to give recognition to the total value of the purchase price of previous service. My situation should be as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DFRDB contributions for the current period (a) $10,017</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Notional interest (b) $3,079</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Less outstanding balance on previous service (c) $12,890</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Plus value of the previous service purchased (d) $16,789</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Account balance (a+b)-(c) + (d)  $16,995</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This transfer value of $16,995 reflects the value of the contributions made in the current period of service and the total value of previous service purchased.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indeed, this is exactly how my equity in the DFRDB Scheme would be determined if I chose to remain in DFRDB. I fail to understand why I should be penalised a considerable financial sum on transfer to MSBS, particularly when the Review Board's intention was to ensure that members would not be disadvantaged.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank honourable senators who have made a contribution so far. I thank Senator Newman for again proving me right. In my comments yesterday I said that she would spend more time on the process than the substance of the matter; although I also understand that, if she believes that I am not going to debate in depth the substance of the matter, that may have been a self-fulfilling prophesy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Spindler invites me first of all to comment on the process. I do not subscribe to the conspiracy theories that we have heard today from Senator Newman. I do not say that the advice of the Department of Defence has been with the consistency and clarity that I would require of advice from officers, but this is an exceptionally complex matter. However, I do not subscribe to the conspiracy theory that in some way Senator Newman was fundamentally led up a dry gulch; nor do I necessarily say that she was given a carte blanche in 1990 to speak to everyone in the Department. Certainly on this issue I know she approached me very early on&mdash;this is before the legislation&mdash;asking whether she could get advice and so on, and I said yes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The normal procedure, though, if one wants to approach people in the Department is to come through the Minister's office, and Mr Downer and Senator Durack have done that. So there may be a misunderstanding there. I do not think there has been one occasion on which Senator Durack or his successor, Mr Downer, have approached me for a briefing on bases or anything else when they have been refused. I believe  Defence is not as combative a portfolio in that sense as some other policy-making portfolios and that maximum access should be given to all parliamentarians, but especially their spokesmen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said at the start, this is a very complex issue. Even though the Senate today will disallow this rule change, I do not believe that the new rule change can be particularly condemned. We are looking at two entirely different superannuation schemes. Trying to move from one scheme to another and bring about consistency is an exceptionally difficult task. The old scheme essentially required 20 years service. It meant that contributions, made at 5.5 per cent of one's salary, went into Consolidated Revenue and one achieved a pay-out at the end of it. The new scheme is quite differently constructed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fair to say that those with continuous service have been given two very clear options: either to stay in the old scheme or to come into the new scheme. They will make that decision with only one factor in mind: self-interest&mdash;what scheme offers them the best deal. Quite clearly, either scheme, depending on one's circumstances, could be preferable to the other. We do not really have a problem with continuous service. The problem arose with broken service and how we were to deal with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first and absolute decision made by the board of trustees, reflected in legislation, is that no-one can carry a debt into the new scheme. I do not think anyone disputes that that should be the case. I think we all agreed when the legislation went through that no-one should take a debt into the new scheme. If one were to transfer from the old scheme to the new scheme, all debts had to be settled one way or another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In defence of the new rules change which we are going to disallow, it must be remembered that it was really a reflection that, when people paid off their debt, they were paying it off to achieve the employer benefit. That is the nub of the question; that is the reason it was done. But as a consequence, the method and total of paying off affected what employee benefit one would get back, and that has been the nub of the question that the Department has been trying to tackle over time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the new superannuation scheme was even in its embryonic stages, people with split service had two potential methods of getting back into the superannuation scheme. They could make a lump sum pay-in when they rejoined the defence forces or they could have a deduction from their pay. In other words, they could increase their contribution from 5.5 per cent; usually another 2.75 per cent was added. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would not surprise anyone in this chamber that, in those circumstances, everyone&mdash;I do not think there was an exception&mdash;opted for the increased contribution, which meant they would pay it off over time. The difficulty with that is: when one is in a transition period, moving from one scheme to another, and one is required to be fully paid off but has not paid it off, what method should be adopted?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trustees quite clearly thought that everyone would use the offset method; that is, the amount they owed would be deducted from the amount they paid in. That is certainly a fair way of them achieving their qualification for the employer contribution down the track. However, because&mdash;and it was not just in October as Senator Newman mentioned; this has been a continuing thing&mdash;lump sum pay-out was possible and because it affected, in a different scheme, the amount of one's own money one got back, that in turn led to a situation where suddenly a pay-out allowed a much better result than the offset where one had one's debt deducted from what one had contributed. It left an entirely different result&mdash;not in terms of what one got back from the employer but in terms of what one got back from one's own contributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that the new rule change tried to do was affect that particular disadvantage. In other words, if there were two servicemen, one of whom had the cash, either by borrowing or in savings, needed to pay out, he was substantially advantaged over the other who could not accumulate those assets to pay it off&mdash;even though I am sure one could make a rational argument, in terms of interest rates, inflation rates and everything else, that it was really in the person's interest to pay off. Therefore, the rules change was brought in to make everyone equal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another viewpoint that we can put over the top of that; that is, how people with continuous service are treated compared with people with broken service. I am arguing that the rules change was essential to give equal treatment to those with broken service, but, on the other hand, does that create a disadvantage for those people compared with those in continuous service?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can look at the matter two ways. Both ways are right in terms of equity; the issue is just about which one we should prefer. Senator Newman referred to the Government Actuary's advice&mdash;the two bob each way advice. He acknowledged that either view could be accepted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If today we disallow this regulation&mdash;somewhere in the order of 2,100 to 2,300 people have not made a decision; I put on the public record that I am not particularly concerned that the cut-off date is in 20 days because they have all been thinking about it up to this point and making arrangements&mdash;they will be able to make that decision in the next 20 days. What we do not know is how many will make that decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other aspect of this scheme is that if people do not elect to transfer they are kept in the old scheme. We do not know how many people have decided, `I am not going to transfer, so why should I bother putting in the declaration because I will be automatically kept in the old scheme'. So we could have any proportion of people staying in the old scheme&mdash;which will mean that nothing is affected here&mdash;or up to 2,300 people suddenly switching in the next 20 days. I cannot even make a guess as to who is affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the meantime, if we disallow this today, we have to give some consideration to those 170 people who have made a decision to transfer from the old scheme to the new scheme by way of an offset rather than a lump sum payment because from May to September they did not have the opportunity of choosing a lump sum payment. As late as midnight last night we were wrestling with this problem. We have come to the conclusion that we cannot do it by administrative means: we are so entrapped by the rules under the Act that that is impossible. But we believe that we can fix up the 170-odd people by way of a rules change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those people have not had the opportunity of making the same plans as others in the last few months. People know that we were not able to put in a rule to change the cut-off date. Because these people have elected into a scheme, they are no longer affected by the cut-off date. It will be possible to do a subset of this rules change to give them 90 days to make their arrangements. So we are not in breach of the legislation because they have already elected. Only those who have not elected will be hit by the 30-day cut-off date. So we will be under way to write a rule to in effect give those 170 people the same right as those who elected to make a lump sum payment before May and those who, subsequent to today, want to make a lump sum payment. For the neatness of the public record I will incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> a two-page advice from the Actuary which, as I think Senator Newman has seen, is the first advice. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mr Thompson</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">MSBS RULES&mdash;BUY BACK ARRANGEMENTS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your minute of 25 June.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As requested, I have examined the appropriateness of the recent change to the MSBS Rules, in the light of the principles established in the DFRDB Review Committee Report. This Report is extremely comprehensive and has formed the basis both for the design of the MSBS and for the transfer arrangements offered to members of the DFRDB who wished to join MSBS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The treatment of DFRDB buy back arrangements was considered by the Review Committee, and their conclusions are stated in paragraphs 15.21 to 15.23 of their Report. These conclusions may be briefly stated as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i)no buy-back arrangements would be permitted in the MSBS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii)where a DFRDB member has entered into a buy-back arrangement then the MSBS will give full credit for prior service in the calculation of the employer financed benefit, whether the buy-back had been completed or not</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iii)where a buy-back has been completed, the transfer value, calculated as member contributions plus notional interest, would include all contributions made for the buy-back</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iv)where a buy back has not been completed, the transfer value would be calculated as member contributions plus notional interest (including contributions actually made towards the buy-back) less the outstanding amount of the buy-back price. (If this produced a negative result, then the member would be required to pay to DFRDB the amount of the deficiency before they could transfer).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Report the Review Committee state that `Repayments [of the buy back price] are on a fortnightly basis'. There is no qualification to this statement, which is not in fact correct:  repayments were most commonly made fortnightly, but members in the DFRDB have always had the option of making lump sum payments towards their outstanding buy back obligations. It is therefore reasonable to suppose that the Report lays down the method which should apply when repayments are made on a fortnightly basis, but this may not necessarily be applicable to lump sum repayments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now it is a peculiarity of this method that, for a member with an outstanding buy-back obligation, each $1 of contribution made towards the buy back will increase the member's transfer value by $2. If the buy back contributions were on a fixed fortnightly basis (as the Committee assumed) the peculiarity would not have given rise to any particular problems. However, since members can choose to make lump sum payments, it would obviously be in their interests to do so, if they are able to afford it. So an anomaly would be created between members who can afford to make lump sum payments, and those who cannot.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recent Rule change redresses this anomaly, by effectively applying the Committee's method at 1 October 1991, and providing that each $1 of contributions made thereafter will only increase the transfer value by $1. In my view, this is a reasonable approach in the circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have also examined the alternative point of view enclosed with your minute. This alternative approach involves a rejection of the Committee's clearly stated conclusion, summarised in (iv) above. There would obviously be many problems if any of the Committee's conclusions, reached after full and detailed consideration, were to be re-opened at this stage in the transfer process. I have therefore not examined the merits of this alternative approach in any detail. However, I would point out that if the Committee's conclusions were to be offered for a re-consideration, then there are a number of different approaches which could be taken, some of which would be more favourable to members, while others would be less favourable to members, than the approach adopted by the Committee.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">MSBS RULES&mdash;BUY BACK ARRANGEMENTS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your minute of 23 July 1992. I have now examined the alternative approach in some detail. In order to do this I have had to consider the broad context of the arrangements for transfer from DFRDB to MSBS, and also the buy back arrangements in DFRDB.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this letter I give my opinion on the `official' view, as represented by the current regulations, including the amendment made on 27 May 1992, and the `alternative' view presented in a paper attached to your minute of 25 June 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In forming my views I have had the benefit of meetings with Mr Skinner from the MSBS Implementation Team and Mr van den Tol from the office of the Director General Service Conditions. This enabled me to get a clear picture of the issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the discussion which follows I have ignored the notional interest which is added to employee contributions on transfer to MSBS. It has an effect on the figures but confuses the questions of principle which this letter addresses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The structure of the DFRDB was that members who leave get either an employee benefit (return of contributions) or a defined employer benefit (partly commutable pension) depending on their years of service. Under MSBS, all members who leave get both an employee benefit (return of member contributions plus interest) and a defined employer benefit (preserved benefit).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This difference in structure clearly makes it difficult to determine what is an equitable transfer arrangement. The arrangement adopted was to give credit in MSBS for both the period of service in DFRDB and the contributions paid to DFRDB. In effect the transferring member commenced in MSBS in the position they would have been in had the MSBS always existed and they had been members of it throughout.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The buy back arrangements in DFRDB have not been replicated in the MSBS. They operated on the basis that a member who had left the defence forces and then rejoined could buy back their previous service. This was important in the DFRDB, where no employer benefit was payable until after twenty years service. In MSBS, the employer benefit starts to vest after one year and is fully vested after seven years, and so a buy back arrangement was not felt necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The way the DFRDB buy back operated was that a buy back price was struck on re-entry to the forces. This price was 5.5% of the member's salary at re-entry, multiplied by the years of previous service. This was established as a debt, which could be paid off by fortnightly instalments, subject to a minimum fortnightly payment. Since no interest was charged on the debt, it was always in the member's interest to make repayments at the minimum level, and this was commonly done. Any outstanding debt at the time of retirement became payable then.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The question is&mdash;how should these buy back members be treated on transfer to MSBS?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think it is useful to draw a comparison with the DFRDB.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i)In the DFRDB the buy back price can be regarded as a proxy for member contributions attributable to prior service. That is the member is restoring the contributions to those which a continuing member would have. However there is a small penalty because the member has to make contributions on the basis of a higher salary (salary at re-entry).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii)The member is entitled to an employer financed benefit when total service reaches twenty years. That is buy back service vests when the member reaches a total of twenty years of service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iii)On retirement any outstanding debt is deducted from the commutation in the first instance. If the commutation represents the member's contributions then this may be regarded as the member foregoing the contributions attributable to prior service which had not been restored at the time of retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This suggests that the method which would have been most consistent with the DFRDB approach would be as follows. Allow all contributions which have been paid to be included in the member transfer value. Allow buy back service to vest at the time it would have vested in DFRDB, ie after twenty years total service. Treat the outstanding </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">debt as member contributions attributable to prior service which have not been restored. As such they should not be deducted from the MSBS transfer value, because the MSBS transfer value already excludes these contributions. This option would have been the most consistent with the treatment in DFRDB but administratively complex, and not in harmony with the general philosophy behind MSBS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another possibility would have been to provide proportionate vesting. Under this option all contributions which have been paid would be included in the member transfer value. Only a proportion of buy back service would vest in the member, the proportion being calculated as the ratio of debt repaid to initial debt. Since the buy back service would have been reduced to allow for the fact that the debt had not been fully repaid, no outstanding debt would remain. Again this method is not considered further.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now consider the `official' and `alternative' views.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The `official' view is that the member transfer value should be calculated as total contributions at the date of transfer less the outstanding debt at 1 October 1991. If the outstanding debt at 1 October 1991 exceeds the total contributions at the date of transfer (ie the transfer value is negative) then the member has to make additional buy back contributions at least equal to the excess before being allowed to transfer. The member transfer value would then be recalculated including the additional buy back contributions as total contributions. Buy back service vests immediately, in the sense that, on transfer, the member is given credit for all buy back service for the purposes of calculating the MSBS employer financed benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the buy back price, or initial debt, is regarded as member contributions attributable to buy back service, then the outstanding debt at 1 October 1991 can be regarded as member contributions which had not been restored by 1 October 1991. If this is the case then it is not reasonable to deduct the outstanding debt at 1 October 1991 from the total contributions paid to the date of transfer. However, as mentioned above, buy back service vests immediately on transfer to the MSBS. If the outstanding debt is considered to apply to the employer financed benefit then the deduction for outstanding debt makes more sense.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A consequence of the `official' view is that members who have only recently started their buy back will need to pay in a lump sum if they are to be permitted to transfer to the MSBS. For a member with a large amount of previous service, and therefore a large buy back price, this could be difficult. Moreover these are the members who would not have to wait very long before becoming eligible for an employer financed benefit in the DFRDB.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The `alternative' view is that the member transfer value should be calculated as total contributions at the date of transfer. Any outstanding debt at the time of transfer is forgiven. However, if the initial debt exceeds the total contributions at the date of transfer then the member has to make additional buy back contributions at least equal to the excess before being allowed to transfer. Buy back service vests immediately, provided total contributions exceed the buy back price.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The logic of this position is that the buy back price, or initial debt, is a proxy for member contributions attached to buy back service. The member should therefore be allowed to include all of the buy back contributions in the member transfer value. The outstanding debt is forgiven because it represents member contributions attached to buy back service which are yet to be restored. Essentially the member should have been allowed to transfer the entire buy back price to MSBS but because the member had not repaid all the buy back price the amount which remains unpaid cannot be transferred.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The additional condition that total contributions at the date of transfer must not be less than the initial debt determines when the employer benefit vests. It appears to have arisen because under the `official' view, a member may not transfer if total contributions at the date of transfer are less than the outstanding debt at 1 October 1991. This condition makes sense for the `official' view, because the outstanding debt is treated as a debt to the Commonwealth for provision of the employer benefit. However it seems less reasonable for the `alternative' view where the initial debt is regarded as a debt to the member.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my opinion the `alternative view' is one of a number of reasonable views which may be held on the question of how the buy back arrangements should be treated on transfer to MSBS. In my opinion it is the most generous view which could reasonably be taken (except for the condition on eligibility to transfer, which does not seem intrinsic to the approach). In order to support the `alternative' view, the following conclusions would have to be reached:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i)For each year of service, the appropriate accrual in MSBS is both an employee financed benefit and an employer financed benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii)The member's right to the MSBS employer component in respect of prior service arises from the member's decision to buy back service, not from any further service or from contributions. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iii)The member's entitlement to prior service vests when total contributions are at least equal to the initial buy back price.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iv)The member's right to the MSBS employee component in respect of prior service arises from the payment of contributions towards the buy back.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(v)The full amount of the buy back price should be regarded as employee contributions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to support the `official' view, the conclusions would have to be different in the following respect:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i)The member's right to the MSBS employer component in respect of prior service arises from both the member's decision to buy back service and from the actual payment of buy back contributions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii)Buy back contributions made prior to l October 1991 give the right to both the employee financed benefit and the employer financed benefit in respect of prior service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iii)Buy back contributions made after 1 October 1991 give the right to employer financed benefits only.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A consequence of both approaches is that the ability of members to transfer may depend on their ability to make a lump sum payment prior to transfer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would be possible to take the view that buy back contributions (whether made before or after 1 October 1991) should give rights to employer financed benefits only. This would be substantially more severe than the `official' view.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I indicated at the outset, the structure of MSBS is so different from that of the DFRDB that it is not possible to devise a simple approach which will satisfy everyone: there will always be differences of view. Indeed, this is one reason for retaining the old DFRDB scheme while giving members the option to transfer to the new MSBS.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Canberra ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Giles</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to the Committee's request for advice on a representation from Senator Newman on Instrument No.2 of 1992 made under subsection 5(1) of the Military Superannuation and Benefits (MSB) Act 1991 which took effect on 25 May 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The instrument relates to transfer provisions for some 2400 members who at 1 October 1991 were paying additional contributions to buy back a previous period of service in the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits (DFRDB) Scheme for pension purposes. The purpose of the Instrument is to ensure fair treatment for all members who elect to transfer to the MSBS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will first summarise the treatment of past service debt for re-entered DFRDB members. Under the DFRDB Act, members who resigned with a refund of contributions and later rejoined the Defence Force could elect to purchase their previous period of service so that it would count towards their DFRDB retirement benefit. The purchase price was based on the rank and salary of the member at re-entry and was thus greater than the original refund of contributions. The purchase price could be paid immediately or in fortnightly instalments of additional contributions. In practice, members always chose to pay in instalments. In DFRDB, if the purchase price debt has not been paid in full at retirement, the member's commuted pension benefit is reduced by the amount of the purchase price outstanding. The additional contributions paid to purchase past service are only directly refunded to the member when he or she resigns from the ADF before qualifying for a retirement benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The significance of the arrangements for purchasing past service for re-entered DFRDB members is that they establish the principle that the member must pay off the purchase of service debt when an employer-financed benefit becomes due. This principle is inherent in the MSBS transfer provisions for re-entered members which were recommended by the DFRDB Review Committee. The Instrument re-establishes this principle except for any debt already paid before 1 October 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The DFRDB Review Committee was of the view that the carryover of debts into the new Scheme was undesirable. At the same time, it recognised that the repayment of a debt before transfer to MSBS could be beyond the reach of many members and could prevent them from transferring. Accordingly, the Committee recommended that any outstanding debt should be offset against a member's transfer value (the starting credit of member-financed benefit in the MSBS comprising DFRDB contributions, including additional contributions already made to purchase previous service, and notional interest). Although the starting amount of member-financed benefit is reduced, full credit is given for previous service being purchased in the employer-financed benefit entitlement at transfer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Review Committee did not envisage that any members who had been paying a past service debt by fortnightly instalment would do anything but use the offset and the provision was incorporated into the MSBS Rules. As a result, all literature and advice on the treatment of the debt for re-entered members only illustrated the offset method. Note that the offset method aligns with the treatment of debt for purchasing past service under DFRDB in that any debt outstanding at retirement is repaid by virtue of an offset.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before the Instrument amending the Rules, there was an unintended gain in MSBS transfer values for those DFRDB members who chose to repay the amount of their purchase price outstanding as a lump sum, when compared with those who utilised the offset arrangement. For example, where a member paid an outstanding DFRDB purchase of service debt of $2,000 at 1 October 1991 in a lump sum before transfer, the resulting transfer value was $4,000 more than the transfer value for the member who offset the $2,000 debt outstanding against contributions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effect of the Rule change is that any DFRDB member who has elected to joint the MSBS after 25 May and who, after 1 October 1991, paid additional contributions to purchase previous DFRDB service will not have that money included as contributions in his or her transfer value. However, the debt component of the transfer value will be reduced by the amount of contributions paid. The member who repays an outstanding DFRDB purchase of service debt of $2,000 before transfer will have a transfer value which is $2,000 greater than the transfer value for the member who uses the offset arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Instrument is not retrospective in any prejudicial way. It does not remove any entitlement from members who took advantage of the unintended consequences before the Instrument came into operation. Moreover, all members affected by the amendment were forwarded written advice of the change on 26 May 1992 (copy attached) and those DFRDB members in the process of repaying DFRDB purchase of service debts at the time of the Rule change received individual counselling and were given the option to have the repayment refunded.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Instrument does not operate harshly or unfairly. What it does is to ensure that as far as possible members are provided with the benefits which were set out in the literature including the Personal Information Statements provided to all members about their entitlements. There could be no legitimate expectation that members would receive windfall benefits beyond the intended scope of the Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need for the Rule change has been the subject of careful deliberation by the MSBS Trust Board, and subsequently by a high level Departmental Committee who sought the advice of the Australian Government Actuary (AGA). The AGA (copy of letter attached) has advised that the change is fair in the light of the DFRDB Review Committee's recommendation that any DFRDB debt would be repaid prior to transfer to MSBS by offsetting the debt against the MSBS member-financed benefit equity. It would be contrary to a specific recommendation of the DFRDB Review Committee to adopt the position which Senator Newman has recommended.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I hope that this letter allays the Committee's concerns. However, if further advice is required on this matter, Departmental staff will be available for discussions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As to the financial aspects of this, it should be acknowledged and put on the record that these measures will have both a perverse and adverse affect. By disallowing this new rule, there may be an increased impost on Commonwealth revenues in the long term. When that falls will depend on when people leave the scheme. If many of the 2,300 elect to sign up in the next 20 days, it may also have the perverse effect of an unexpected sudden infusion into public revenues by the Budget payments.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will sum this up for the senators who are interested. It is a fairly complex issue, where there are no absolute rights and wrongs because the two schemes are so dramatically different. Getting the transition provisions right has occurred in the majority of cases. In the cases of those with broken service, trying to remedy one inequity may well lead to another inequity. and we have to be very careful about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am confident that in having this disallowance go through today, and the subsequent rules change which picks up a much smaller group, we can make sure of that group's rights. Another couple of smaller groups could emerge somewhere that I do not know about yet who are suddenly disadvantaged. I do not know. I cannot give anyone that guarantee because the matter is so complex. I very much doubt it, but there might be people who elected to stay in the old scheme who argue to us now, `We wouldn't have elected to stay in the old scheme if we had known this was going to be disallowed'. I doubt that, because most of them would have made their decision to stay in the old scheme on a different set of principles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to be careful that through this action today no-one else is suddenly disadvantaged.

We are also in a position to write to and telephone those 170 people. We can get their names from our database and let them know that, once the trustees and the rules change come in, they will have a different set of options. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will recap a couple of points I made in my previous remarks on the Sales Tax Assessment Bill 1992 and associated Bills. Firstly, I declared that, as a primary producer, I had a personal interest in these Bills. Secondly, I emphasised that the problem with wholesale sales tax was that it was a hidden tax, as are fuel excise and other taxes and, as such, it cascades through the system and enormously increases prices to individual consumers well above what the tax is worth. Thirdly, in a taxation system it is important that there be equity and fairness.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to deal with that question of equity and fairness, particularly as it relates to agriculturalists, as they are now known and not farmers. The definition has been broadened because it includes bee keepers, fence repairers, water borers and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to the May economic statement, we saw the introduction of what is known as ruling 3005. Transport is one of the areas where wholesale sales tax hits not only the farm sector and pastoralists but also miners, other industries and the consumer at the household level because the imposts applied to the carriage of goods add enormously to the final price. I will give just one example. A rig doing 250,000 kilometres per year&mdash;which I am told by transporters is the average economical distance they have to travel&mdash;loaded with freight, pays over $80,000 per year up-front taxes prior to earning a dollar of income. This cascades, as I have already said, through the system to the consumer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the situation which will now exist with regard to trucks which carry goods in the agricultural sector. We find that four-by-two vehicles will still carry sales tax, unless they are only used to drive between contiguous premises.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the situation which exists with four-by-four vehicles with a body, we find that they are exempt for general purpose use by agriculturists, including bee keepers, shearers, crop dusters, fertiliser spreaders, contract harvesters, et cetera. If that particular four-wheel drive has a detachable cover, it remains exempt, but if it has a non-detachable cover, it loses its exemption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will contrast this anomaly with the situation which exists with stock crates. If a stock crate is built onto the semitrailer, it is exempt. But if it is removable and the truck is used for some other purpose&mdash;for example, to carry a load of wheat, fertiliser or anything else&mdash;because that stock crate can be taken off, it ceases to be exempt. That is a direct contradiction in terms of applying simplicity&mdash;and this is supposed to be about simplicity&mdash;to sales tax. It is unbelievable that the Government should come forward and increase the confusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ruling 3005, which was introduced just before the May economic statement, cleared up a lot of these anomalies. Under ruling 3005, bogie drive trucks, which are four-wheel drive trucks with separate steering wheels, became exempt, the same as four-wheel drive trucks, because they are four-wheel drive trucks. The only difference between them is that they have separate steering wheels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We find that that exemption will be removed when this legislation comes into force. Once again there is confusion with regard to the legislation. Yet if a truck which is exactly the same size, carrying the same load and carrying out the same functions, has the driving wheels on the front and on the back and it pulls a trailer, the whole unit is exempt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at other aspects of the situation with regard to trucks, we find that if a semi-trailer is put on one of these four-wheel drive prime movers, they cease to be exempt. But if a dolly is put under that semi-trailer, a tow bar is put onto the dolly and hooked to that four-wheel drive truck, they are exempt. Talk about confusion in terms of the application of a sales tax law!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we talk about confusion, one of the things that needs to be taken into account, as I have already mentioned, is fairness&mdash;fairness between users. The Government needs to answer this question: why should one particular operator who tows a trailer, with exactly the same load, along the road, enjoy the benefits&mdash;if it can be put that way; I think it should be a right in terms of cost of production&mdash;of being exempt from sales tax, yet if he puts that trailer directly onto the four-wheel drive vehicle pulling it along the road, he is not exempt?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be taken into account that it is much safer to put the semi-trailer directly onto the prime mover. As I am sure many people on this side of the chamber would know&mdash;I doubt that many people on the other side would even understand, or attempt to understand&mdash;once a trailer is put behind a towing vehicle, one gets what is known to happen from time to time, particularly on steep or difficult roads, as jack-knifing. The trailer can overtake the towing vehicle and, of course, very serious accidents have occurred, and will continue to occur, with this configuration. If the Government were interested in safety it would get rid of this ridiculous anomaly and encourage people who have to carry their produce or inputs on roads to adopt the safest method. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I work through these various configurations I have talked about equity and fairness, and I have now introduced the subject of safety. In fact, decisions will be made not for practical reasons but for financial reasons&mdash;and one can understand that, because producers have to survive&mdash;which are not in the best public interest. I question why the Government and the people involved in putting this legislation together will be reneging on ruling 3005 which cleared these things up, got rid of the confusion and made the position absolutely clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can put together further configurations. One can have a single-wheel trailer; a tandem wheel trailer; a trailer with a single wheel on the front and tandem on the back; tandem wheels on the front and back; or, for that matter, one can have tri-axles on front and back. Provided that they are towed, they are exempt. I notice that the advising officers are writing lots of notes. It will be rather interesting to find out, through the Minister, whether they have actually looked at the ridiculous situation in which we now find ourselves in terms of the application of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can examine many aspects of the legislation, but I thought that the example I have given was an extremely good one to demonstrate how something that is supposedly simple is totally confusing and will lead to distortions in the decision making process. I re-emphasise the craziness of the situation whereby stock carriers and stock crates that are built onto a trailer will be tax exempt. But the stock crate can be built as a separate unit and can be removed, which is the main practice. In the agricultural sector, trucks are used for many purposes. At seeding time a super bin is put on the back; at harvest time a grain bin is put on the back; and in between times they are used for a variety of other means, including the cartage of stock. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the time remaining to me, having emphasised the inconsistencies that have been introduced in terms of the moving of agricultural product, I now turn to one other point relating to disadvantaged people. If somebody has a hearing problem, there is a sales tax exemption on the hearing aid. Yet if a person has an eye sight problem and requires, for example, a particular computer in order to study, that computer is not sales tax exempt. Once again, it highlights the inconsistency of this Government and the way in which it treats people in the community in different ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, a reasonably close friend of mine is in this situation. I think it is very sad that because this particular child has an eye sight deficiency, the child is treated differently from children who have a deficiency in another area. It highlights very clearly the inability of this Government to come to grips with consistency and fairness for people in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude my remarks by saying that this legislation, far from simplifying many areas, makes it more confusing. I have already highlighted a couple of points. It does not lead to fairness, nor does it lead to equity. It expands significantly the number of areas under which sales tax will be claimed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most damning things about it is with regard to people who are registered as against people who are not registered. Of course, registered and non-registered users can claim sales tax exemption. But if a person is registered, the amount of sales tax has to be put on the invoice. If a person is a non-registered consumer, it does not. I pose the question: how does a non-registered consumer claim the sales tax exemption if the sales tax does not have to be placed on the docket or invoice? Of course, that is part of hiding the sales tax component which we all pay every time we purchase something off the shelf. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation creates significant confusion. It significantly broadens the indirect tax base in a secret way and it does not provide fairness and equity, which was highlighted by a number of people and organisations who put in submissions to the Senate Select Committee on Sales Tax Legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This package of wholesale sales tax Bills is nothing but a tax grab by Keating, nothing but a tax grab to increase the tax take from the ordinary Australian battler. The whole of the framework of the wholesale sales tax structure is based on illogical principles, it is inequitable, and in surveys and opinions that the Australian Taxation Office itself has commissioned the finding has been that as a system of taxation it is beyond redemption and should be scrapped.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The manner in which these Bills have been dealt with in first being introduced and then being referred to the Select Committee on Sales Tax Legislation for thorough investigation by this chamber&mdash;in the meantime the Government does a back flip on a couple of aspects of it but does not let the Committee have the details of those precise amendments, attempting to thwart the work of the Committee&mdash;shows the cynical attitude the Government has towards struggling taxpayers. Bear in mind that since Keating was first Treasurer and now Prime Minister, the tax take from the wholesale sales tax area has increased by about 300 per cent. Who asked the ordinary Australian voter or taxpayer whether they approved of that? Who asked the taxpayers whether they approved of the fact that, since Mr Keating was first Treasurer and now Prime Minister, the amount of tax that we collect from Australians has more than doubled?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamental problem with our taxation system is that it has worked assiduously against savings&mdash;and our savings are at an all-time low&mdash;it has worked against incentive and it has worked against productivity. The monthly balance of payments figures show that we continue to go further and further into debt. They are caused by the interest payments we have to make on borrowings we have already made. The taxation structure which this Government has overseen has meant that we have not accumulated sufficient Australian savings to invest in our own country. Basically, we have gone overseas and we have borrowed other people's savings, and we have to meet the repayments on those borrowings. That debt now stands at $150 billion. To meet the monthly repayments on that, we have to borrow more and effectively go into more and more debt&mdash;somewhere between $12 billion and $20 billion additionally per annum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this happened in our regular household situation, we know precisely what would happen. If we had a mortgage on our house, a Bankcard and a few other debts and we simply were not earning enough money to meet those monthly repayments, in would come the bailiffs, sell us up, and down would go our standard of living. It is not much different with countries. What has happened? We have an international debt and we are not producing or earning enough to meet those monthly repayments. Only it is not the bailiffs that come in; it is the International Monetary Fund. It comes in and says to the Government of the day, `We will reschedule your debts but you in turn have to put the following policies in place', and then our standard of living goes down. Quite frankly, we have to introduce a system of reform that will enable Australians to produce more, to meet the monthly repayments, to stabilise that debt and maintain our standard of living. Quite frankly, the Fightback package does just that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Fightback package is based on logic and equity, commonsense and fairness. Let us take a look at the heritage of this wholesale sales tax and how it began life. It began life in 1930 as a temporary tax. Back in 1930, most of the population was employed by making things. That is no longer the case. Most people who are in employment in Australia today are employed in either the production or delivery of services, yet we have a tax which currently raises between $9 billion and $10 billion, distorting the economy by placing that tax on things and not on services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important that we look at the numbers, at the structure of the tax take. We now raise $90 billion per annum by way of taxation revenue. Of that $90 billion, around $50 billion is collected by way of personal income tax; $41 billion of it is collected by way of PAYE tax. Since I have been on the inquiry into the Australian Taxation Office, I have come to understand what PAYE really stands for: pay all you earn. Of the $50 billion, $41 billion is PAYE tax. We also have some Medibank tax, which is just part of the income tax system&mdash;it does not go into any special account&mdash;and then of course we have provisional tax. In other words, we are dependent on taxing income. We are dependent on a direct tax base. The Fightback package removes that onus by making us more dependent on an indirect tax base. It removes the unfair taxes that currently keep our savings at a dismal low, keep productivity at a dismal low and give no incentive to anyone to work harder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Additional tax has been ripped off the taxpayer by that well-worn practice of allowing increases in wages and salaries, thereby pushing wage earners and salary earners into higher tax brackets&mdash;ripping off something like an additional $22 billion in tax; and nobody ever asked the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition is being totally fair and open. It has published its tax reform&mdash;the GST has become a shorthand term for saying tax reform&mdash;which is central to the theme of the Fightback package. That reform will in fact deliver an increase in savings, incentive to work harder and greater productivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One might ask why. Let us look at what happens now. Taxpayers have two choices about what to do with their hard earned after-tax dollar: they can either save it or they can spend it. Australians have chosen to be great spenders and poor savers. The reason is quite simple. On the one hand, if one saved that after-tax dollar, up until the recession we had to have, it would have been eaten away by inflation and tax would have been paid on it at the top marginal rate. On the other hand, if one spent it, one got instant gratification and got precisely what one wanted when one wanted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until now people have not understood that the price of the things they buy already has a tax component in it. I call it the Government's GST, the Government's secret tax. The Government is quite good at secret taxes. Mr Dawkins has put a few in the current Budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reasoning behind the reform is that if people spend there will be a tax on their consumption but they will pay less tax because we will abolish seven taxes. We are going to abolish the wholesale sales tax, which currently raises $9 billion to $10 billion; we are going to abolish the tax on petroleum products, which raises between $6 billion and $7 billion; we are going to abolish payroll tax, which raises about $6 billion in States; we are going to abolish tariff tax, which raises between $3 billion and $4 billion; and we are going to abolish the compulsory training levy, lump sum super tax and the coal export levy. We are going to abolish $20 billion worth of taxes&mdash;taxes that are presently on business and are reflected in the price of everything we buy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But more than that, out of that $50 billion of direct personal income tax we will give back $13 billion, around a third. Individual tax will come down by about a third. When we do our sums and abolish $20 billion of tax and replace one of those taxes, the wholesale sales tax, with a broad-based consumption tax, that is, removing the distortion of taxing goods only and spreading it across the full gamut of what happens in our economy&mdash;logical and equitable&mdash;there will be a one-off inflationary impact of 4.4 per cent. If we apply the implicit price deflator, we can probably get it down to 2.2 per cent. Or we can use Treasury's figure of 3.7 per cent. But we have chosen to abide by the conservative figure of 4.4 per cent. For that reason, we have chosen to increase pensions by 8 per cent and special benefits by 6 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, as I said, the Fightback package is based on logic and equity, fairness and commonsense. It removes biases within the economy which have kept savings, incentive and productivity down. We will give Australians an opportunity to prosper and to keep more of their hard earned dollars. Somebody who is earning, say, $30,000 a year, who under the Fightback package will pay $30 a week less tax, will be able to more than double his or her income and pay no more than 30c in the dollar tax as a top rate of tax. We look forward to 95 per cent of the Australian work force paying no more than a top rate of 30c in the dollar tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I say that we are serious about encouraging savings, not only will people pay less tax on the money they save, but for a family earning $50,000 a year or less which creates new savings, the first $2,000 that it earns will be tax free. Further, we will increase the tax threshold from $5,400 to $7,000, ensuring that 320,000 additional Australians will pay no tax at all. Fairness and equity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us take a look at some of the anomalies. I will give the Senate some examples of the wholesale sales tax regime&mdash;and it is a regime; it was overseen by 763 public servants. I asked at Estimates committee hearings last time we met, `Tell me, do we still have 763 public servants overseeing 70,000 wholesale sales tax returns?' They said, `Oh no, Senator. We are downsizing'. I said, `How nice. How many have we got?' The answer was `740'. I said, `Did the 23 people actually go away or did they just get transferred to somewhere else?' `Oh no, Senator. They just got transferred somewhere else'. Perhaps they will just have to get transferred back again together with another legion of public servants to try to deal with the absolute mess this new legislation will introduce&mdash;the legion of questions and the areas of conflict that it will open up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But back to the illogicality and inequity of the way it works. If a housewife goes into the supermarket&mdash;or even some of the fellows over there who might go in from time to time&mdash;and fills up her basket with soap, toothpaste, toilet tissue, disinfectant, orange juice, chocolate biscuits and a few other fundamentals, she is paying anywhere from 10 to 30 per cent on those items. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. Every other item you buy in the supermarket also has a tax component. It is very interesting that the products that women buy are taxed the hardest and highest. Nonetheless, when you buy those things in the supermarket you might go across to the soft drink counter and get some Coca Cola, which has a 20 per cent tax, or some mineral water, which also has a 20 per cent tax. But mineral water is not quite so straightforward. If you buy mineral water with bubbles, there is a 20 per cent tax, but if you buy natural spring water with no bubbles, there is no tax. Natural spring water with bubbles attracts 20 per cent tax. Natural spring water whose label states that it has minerals in it but no bubbles attracts no tax. But if the word `mineral' is put on the label along with `natural spring water' and it still has no bubbles, there is a 20 per cent tax. That is neither logical nor equitable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line&mdash;I am sure that Senator Button would be interested in this&mdash;is that a good Australian mineral water, locally produced, pays 20 per cent tax but good old Evian water imported from France pays no tax. If you are like Mr Keating and you are into imported Zegna suits and you like champagne, caviar and salmon, there is no tax. But if you are just an ordinary Australian who is getting by and you like a beer, a Vegemite sandwich and a few crisps, you are going to find your life more difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Fightback package Mr Keating will pay tax on his Zegna suits, his caviar, his champagne and his salmon, but the guy who just wants to go down to Grace Bros and buy his suit off the rack, and have a beer with his pie at the footy, will pay much less tax. So what is built into the system is some choice. If you are a big spender who likes antique French clocks, wants to buy into pig farms and wear imported Italian suits, you are going to pay a lot of tax. But if you suddenly decide that you do not want to pay that amount of tax and you are going to save it, we are quite pleased about that, too, because we need the savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that some of the unresolved questions in this sales tax legislation relate to how we deal with rulings and the inconsistencies that can flow. Let me give the Senate an example of the way it works now. I am sure we are all aware of a good product known as Aeroguard and another good product known as Rid&mdash;products used to keep away the mozzies and the blowflies. If you are up in the north of Australia they can actually stop you from contracting diseases such as Ross River fever. Until the end of last year those products were exempt from wholesale tax. But last year the Brisbane office of the Tax Office decided that they did not meet the criteria under the exemption legislation of being either a drug or a medicine and that, therefore, it would apply the wholesale sales tax to them. However, the Parramatta branch of the Tax Office disagreed. It said that the products did meet the criteria. So we had conflicting rulings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what do we do? We have an arbitration. We are paying for all this. We hear evidence and we hear statements. At the end of the day there is a decision that says that the products do not meet the criteria, that they are not a drug or a medicine&mdash;no reasons given&mdash;some case law is stated and the bottom line is that as from 1 March 1992 a 20 per cent tax is applied to Aeroguard and Rid. But of course the price to the consumer does not go up by 20 per cent; the price to the consumer goes up more like 28 per cent because the profit margin has to be put on the tax. In other words, it cascades; it is building all the time into a greater amount of tax. It is neither equitable nor logical. It is a mishmash. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the reports provided to the Australian Tax Office showed that the only way to proceed with this illogical and inequitable tax is to abolish it and to replace it with a broad-based consumption tax. That is part of what the Fightback package does. We will abolish seven taxes. We will abolish $20 billion worth of taxes, including $1.7 billion worth of taxes currently on exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Budget, Mr Dawkins could find a mere $75m which was going to expand the EMDG scheme, which is designed to keep people who were being excluded as being long term users of the scheme under the last piece of legislation this Government introduced excluded by a further three years. But with the introduction of the Fightback package, $1.7 billion worth of taxes now on exports goes. We will give Australia a chance to stabilise that international debt, to meet those monthly repayments and, ultimately, to use the proceeds of our privatisation program to begin the reduction process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program to abolish $20 billion worth of taxes, give back to taxpayers one-third of their own money&mdash;one-third of income tax&mdash;and raise pensions by 8 per cent and special benefits by 6 per cent is a restructuring of the economy that will allow that fierce Australian spirit that is still within us again to become productive and hard-working. We have slipped in Australia, because of the sorts of policies this Government has pursued, into accepting the adage that near enough is good enough&mdash;`She'll be right, Jack'. It is not good enough any more. We have to move to the situation where we say that only the best will do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax reform package we are proposing is just that. It is not a bandaid job. It is not like the Budget that was brought in the other day, which I called a patchwork and panic Budget: patch over the areas that are in need of hiding because the Government is panicked into trying to find an election date. We should look at things from a logical and equitable perspective, using fairness and common sense. We should move away from dependence on the direct tax base, which has penalised ordinary Australians and denied them the right to keep some of their hard-earned money. We should put back into the system incentive: if people do well and work hard, they can earn more, again creating productivity, and fundamentally having something left over at the end of the day to save so that we can truly be more and more dependent on ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our reform will mean that there will be a simplicity in administration of this tax reform. Because it is a single rate of tax, not a multiple rate like the wholesale sales tax, and across the board, it will be quite cheap to administer. Every three months a firm that has a turnover of $50,000 per annum is obliged to register. Every three months it will put in an A4 form. It is very simple. Up the top of the form is the name of the company and its registration number. Further down is the amount of GST it has collected to be remitted to the Tax Office. Down further is the amount of input taxes. That is the amount of GST the firm has paid on items it needs to do business. That amount is 100 per cent refundable. If the figure at the bottom of the page is higher than the figure at the top of the page, the Tax Office sends the firm a cheque. If the figure at the top is greater than the figure at the bottom, it sends the Tax Office a cheque. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The records that will be kept are the same records that are kept now in order to know, first, whether the firm is making a profit and, secondly, to supply its income tax return. The firm keeps the records in the same way that it keeps those records now&mdash;on the basis of several years in case it is subject to an audit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax itself is simple and logical. It means that people who operate in the black economy are likely to come out of the black economy, as was the experience in New Zealand. When New Zealand had a similar provision about registration, it had more firms register than it knew it had firms. The reason was very simple: if the firm did not register, it was not eligible for the inputs tax 100 per cent refund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the whole package is driven by logic and equity, fairness and common sense. For that reason, we zero rate health, education, exports, charities and religious bodies. We do it in education because we believe that education is so important that it needs to have additional money spent on it, and we are pledged to spend an additional $3 billion between now and the year 2000. We will certainly not put it on health because there is already a tax in place and we do not put a tax on a tax. Exports are vital for us to earn our way out of the huge debt this Government has plunged us into, and of course, compassion in the area of charities and religion is essential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An exemption means that the consumer does not pay the GST but that the inputs taxes are not refundable. The two universal areas where this has been applied internationally are domestic rents and financial transactions. Financial transactions include such things as mortgage repayments, cheques, insurance payments and so on. They are all exempt to the consumer. At every turn, we are working to make it simple to apply. We already have 740 public servants who will no longer be needed to collect the wholesale sales tax, so there will be plenty of spare people around to do any administration that is required. Around Australia there will be at least another 1,000 who will no longer be needed to collect those other six taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I look at this pile of six Bills&mdash;and there is a  seventh Bill that was the back-off, which only further confuses it&mdash;and at how our tax legislation gets bigger and bigger and more complicated, at how our tax laws are not administered in a fair way because of the complexity, and one has only to look at my correspondence to see the evidence of that, we truly have to simplify our tax system in accordance with the Fightback package and not complicate it in the way that this sales tax legislation does, pretending to simplify it when all it does is extend it and bring in extra tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating, first as Treasurer and then as Prime Minister, has been ever ready and ever willing to collect more tax. Back in 1985 he had a good thought. He was going to introduce a broad based consumption tax. He was going to be on his cart until the wheels came off. He went out fiercely and said what he believed in. But at the end of the day the unofficial member of the Cabinet, Mr Kelty, told him he could not have it. Ever thus, the Labor Party is but the political wing of the trade union movement, which we are frequently reminded of as we listen to Senator Cook, a member of the BWIU and a former trade union official. When we remember those things, we see that the interests of reforming a tax system went out the window because the trade union movement, an unelected body, said that we could not have it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Fightback package has been published early so that people can become familiar with it. Many people spend hours in long discussions explaining how it will work, looking at the other parts of the package in the health area and so on, all of which benefit retirees. Unlike Mr Keating, who back in 1985 said `There aren't too many of those and they don't matter anyway, we cannot do anything for them', we have said that that is harsh and inequitable. We have policies for self-funded retirees so that they are compensated; they will all have a pharmaceutical benefits card, which is of enormous benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a good package; it is a fair package; it is an equitable package and a logical package. When I say that we are going to vote against this mishmash of inequitable, illogical wholesale sales tax Bills, I do it in the full knowledge that when we win the next election and that tax is abolished, along with six others, when we abolish $20 billion worth of tax on Australian business, give back $13 billion of all income tax to hard-working taxpayers and raise pensions by 8 per cent and special benefits by 6 per cent, people will be better off. I say to the Australian people: `Do not be confused. Do not let the Labor Party confuse you, because you will be better off'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a fair and equitable package designed to let Australia and the Australian people prosper, get out of the debt that is the legacy the Labor Party left us, and again become resilient and strong, proud of our heritage and our history, looking forward to the twenty-first century instead of cowering in a maze of debt. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the same Senator McMullan&mdash;the hotshot who is meant to be demolishing Fightback&mdash;is reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> as saying that ordinary cars were going to become more expensive. If that is not exaggerating beyond the realm of reality, what is it? Senator McMullan knows, as does everybody else, that the price of cars is going to come down under Fightback. Jeannette McHugh, the new fandangled Minister who leapt up from nowhere, said in the same paper that the cost of products used by women was going to increase. If that is not telling little whoppers, what is? Ms McHugh failed to say that the cost of products used by women&mdash;whether they be cosmetics, sanitary items or whatever&mdash;are taxed at 30 per cent. The tax of 30 per cent will go and be replaced by a 15 per cent goods and services tax. So if that is not another one, what is? I am not allowed to use that word, but I will let people interpret what I have just said in whatever way they wish. </PARA>

They also know that personal income taxes are going to be reduced by 30 per cent. Yet every single solitary Government member and senator continues to say in the other chamber and this place, and all around Australia, that the goods and services tax is going to add 15 per cent to everything. That is clearly incorrect.

Because of political expediency, the Prime Minister has now backed off, not because he does not want to do it but because his political masters, the ACTU, have said, `You cannot do it'. The Prime Minister's political masters, the de facto members of Cabinet&mdash;Bill Kelty, Martin Ferguson and their ilk&mdash;are saying that the Government cannot have a goods and services tax. They are saying, `You cannot have a fair tax. We will not allow you to have a fair tax. We will not allow you to abolish six taxes.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, this Government is very cute. It spends taxpayers' money promoting certain products that had previously been exempt and then slaps a tax on them. Let me give two examples. Low alcohol beer used to be fully tax exempt. Drink-drive promotions were undertaken to encourage people to drink low alcohol beer. Once people were quite satisfied that low alcohol beer was not going to poison them and they quite liked it, what did this Government do? It slapped a tax on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the same with sunscreens. Many people will remember not so long ago the `Slip, Slop, Slap' commercials which encouraged people to use sunscreens, and the use of sunscreens, thankfully, has grown enormously&mdash;simultaneously with the sales tax. Yet here we have the Government saying, `We don't have a goods and services tax'. Absurd!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill also extends its web of tax across services. Most people do not realise that some of their services are already being taxed, and now we are going to have more services taxed. Take design services: there are an awful lot of companies that do not have in-house designers, so when they send something out to be designed on contract it is taxed, but that tax is not refundable, as it would be under the goods and services tax. At the moment not a brass razoo is refunded. Once again, we have a situation where neither the Senate nor the business community owes any gratitude whatsoever to a government and a Treasurer who condescend, for example, to modify a general anti-avoidance provision so unspecific as to have destroyed all certainty in sales tax administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government says that charities should be grateful it has now changed its mind on taxing donated goods. Charities should be grateful: is that not nice! Charities are fighting to provide services and facilities for people in the worst depression, created by this Government, in 60 years&mdash;and this Government is actually contemplating putting sales tax on donated goods. Now the Government expects, because it has decided, as a result of pressure, to take it out of the legislation, that charities should be grateful. How absurd for that even to be a consideration in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should all ask ourselves the question: what would have happened to this legislation if we in the Opposition had not sought to have it sent to a Senate committee for further scrutiny and we had not had proper consultation? This Government sought not one day's proper consultation with people prior to bringing in the legislation&mdash;not one day. The Government spent two years preparing for this legislation and still has not consulted; and we had person after person coming into the Senate committee and saying, `We were not consulted`. The Institute of Chartered Accountants, for example, was not consulted. The same story was repeated by the Taxation Institute, the Retailers Council, the Jewellers Association and the Photo Marketing Association of Australia. Two years this Government has had, and not one zot of consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It cannot be assumed that, just because the Government has made changes in six areas, there will not be major difficulties for the business community and its advisers. In supposedly simplifying this inherently complex indirect tax, this Government has confronted business with a whole new ball game. But the Government does not care about that. Business currently is striving just to keep its head above water; it is striving to retain its staff and to ensure that more and more people do not need to be put off. Right at this crucial time, what does this Government do? It gives business a whole new ball game of sales tax to deal with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Business is saying, `We cannot cope with any more. We have exemptions, we have things included. There is no rhyme or reason for sales tax exemptions or inclusions. We just want a simplified system'.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what a goods and services tax is all about.

As the Senate would know, the One Nation statement was an inspired economic initiative by the Government to encourage further economic growth by stimulating the economy through investment in public infrastructure and, therefore, investment in the rail system, improved access to ports, getting the National Rail Freight Authority up and running, and a massive commitment to expenditure in technical and further education, in respect of which agreement was reached with the States and which went ahead in July.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on this side of the Parliament&mdash;we, the Government&mdash;see it as a nonsense and offensive to those Australians who have been recognised under our system of honours and awards that this sort of proposal has been put up in such a manner. We are proud of our achievement of having put in place for the first time in our history a comprehensive and indigenous system of honours and awards. It is not something that was imported from Britain; it is our own. It is a system that has been built up in close consultation with our community, the Queen, the Governor-General, the chiefs of our defence forces and community interest groups. It does not include knighthoods and titles, because those sorts of things do not matter to Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Knighthoods were introduced by the Federal Government in 1976, but they were done away with by our Government. We will not go back to a system which is anachronistic, a system which has been proposed by the National Party. In Australia we have quite a number of people who have been distinguished and recognised by knighthoods and other titled awards. Also we have many more from our community who have been recognised by non-titled awards, such as the Order of Australia. They are artists, academics, researchers, business people and community people&mdash;all great Australians and all recognised as great Australians.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been a request by the governments of the United States, Thailand, Denmark and New Zealand to market chicken meat products in Australia. Obviously, the first requirement is that our quarantine laws be observed and the health of our own poultry industry be protected. The task of ensuring that falls to the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. Its job is not to act as a non-tariff barrier to trade. Its job is to be a transparent, scientifically based organisation that looks at the health and disease implications of imports that might come into Australia. It is an organisation which works closely with the community on those matters, makes risk assessments and is entirely transparent from a trade point of view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first point that I should make is that we are not talking here about obstructions to trade. We are talking here about protecting the health of the Australian poultry industry. The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service has prepared a discussion paper on the importation of uncooked frozen chicken meat to Australia. That discussion paper is being circulated for comment at the moment. A number of State agricultural departments have made comment and a number of other technically qualified institutions and individuals are making comment too. I expect&mdash;if I can accurately recall the briefing I have been given on this subject&mdash;that a formal paper will be issued by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service at the end of this year for public comment before any decision is made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part of the question asked what the economic ramifications were. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics&mdash;ABARE&mdash;is also preparing a paper on what the ramifications for the Australian economy would be of an outbreak of Newcastle disease, for example, which is a well known avian disease which would affect the poultry industry in Australia. The Bureau is trying to make some assessment of that so that the issues of risk assessment can be brought into some focus. The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service has asked the relevant section of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy to prepare some sort of commentary on its assessment of the economic impact of trade in this meat. There is no ability on the part of any country to import uncooked chicken meat into Australia at present.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, New Zealand enjoys market access for cooked meat at the present time. The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service is preparing a discussion paper on cooked chicken meat and that will be available for circulation at the end of 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, some questions have been raised as to whether there should be an external review, outside of the formal government structure, of the findings of AQIS when its assessment process is completed. That is a matter that is before the Government. I understand that the Minister leans in that direction, but at this stage I do not think a decision has been made.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to APPM. The agreement covers 35,000 Australians and is the first significant agreement of its sort in the retail sector. It is an agreement that follows on from and borrows the concepts already established in the finance sector, where work forces are largely comprised of women workers, of blending the responsibilities of family and work so that working hours are made flexible to suit the needs of families, and to suit the needs in this case of the Coles supermarket chain which is looking to develop a late night trading element in its trading pattern. From that point of view, it is quite a landmark agreement. As it is the first of its sort in the retail industry, I believe that it will be something of a template for other retail chains when they embrace workplace bargaining.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This agreement is not an example of the Big Bang.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Sunday, I released a study by my Department on the first 100 workplace agreements concluded in Australia. This study reveals that the features of all those agreements effectively are flexible hours; more flexible working arrangements; a high level of consultation and cooperation between management and workers; and improved levels of productivity and competitiveness by the companies concerned. That study of the first 100 agreements will be a useful incentive for other companies to follow along those lines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interjected upon by Senator Walters who said, `What about APPM?'. I can tell her about APPM: it just said to its work force, `You will go on shorter hours and some of you will be sacked'. The same week APPM said that, it decided to sponsor an elite sporting event concerning a yacht race from Melbourne to Launceston. On the one hand, the management sacked the workers because there was not sufficient money in the till to keep an active work force employed and, on the other, it sponsored an elite sporting event, which is open to only a handful of Australians, to promote the company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The comparison between APPM and Australian Newsprint Mills is startling indeed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contrast that with the conflict and division at APPM Burnie and the report in that company's balance sheet that the dispute it conducted against its own employees lost the company some $15m in company accounts.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday I reported that, by agreement, a further 900 waterside workers had voluntarily left the industry, thereby reducing waterfront labour by 5,000 since our reform program started, which is a reduction of 56 per cent. I reported as well that handling rates on Australian waterfronts on average now were competitive with major overseas ports. I reported that container productivity levels had increased by over 50 per cent and that ship turnaround time at Australian ports had increased by 40 per cent.

This is a bit like the advice that lawyers should be given before cross-examination: do not ask a question unless one knows what the answer to it is. I will answer the honourable senator's question. The advice I have before me is advice that the company had decided to abandon this enterprise before it had even started to negotiate what the terms and conditions would be for the handling of this fish on the waterfront in Hobart. It had not properly conducted, or indeed started to conduct, the negotiations on this matter. It is the honourable senator's allegation that the costs were too high. Until the negotiations had been started and concluded, that issue cannot be said in the way in which she has put it. Senator Walters asked the question and that is the answer.

As a result, the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal came down on the industry, and mandated a standard which, as from the beginning of this month, is currently 13 minutes an hour in prime time and 15 minutes outside prime time. I have personally communicated to the industry that it cannot expect to come up with a voluntary code which is out of step with the current mandated standards. That is the message it has got.

Before shipping can sail&mdash;this is a rudimentary fact&mdash;one must actually get the commodity or good on board the ship. Therefore, the starting point in terms of shipping costs is usually at dockside, on the wharf. If I may go back to my answer, I have reported the significant changes in efficiency and productivity gains on the Australian waterfront. I refer to a very good article in the feature pages of this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> by its economic correspondent, Mr Ross Gittins, about the significance of that change, and verifying many of the things I have said in answers to questions here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the shipping front, however, the reform has been equally stunning. That reform started when we came to office, when there was an average manning level on Australian coastal ships of 35 crew per ship. That level has now been reduced, without industrial dispute, by agreement to a level of approximately 21 per ship and in some cases down around 18 per ship. I received a further report only last week from the Shipping Reform Authority. It is not appropriate at this stage to go into what its new targets are, but what is in the offing for Australian coastal shipping is significant further reductions. Those further reductions enable greater efficiencies to be achieved on the Australian coast by Australian ships.</PARA>

What I can say is that there has been significant improvement in the performance of Australian ships.

We are currently awaiting advice on that. The Department was of the firm view that all of the actions taken by the Government in this matter met the requirements of the convention. That is as we understood what, I think on any interpretation, is as reasonable a definition of `transit states' as one could expect to get. It was only after the question was asked and an answer provided, that the Department received advice from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade that the conditions applied had led in its view to a technical breach of the convention. Definitive advice on this has now been sought from the Solicitor-General by the Department.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear, however, that whatever the strict legal position is, Australia has met the objectives of the convention. There has been no risk to the environment. There was French Government approval to ship the wastes to France. The wastes were packed and transported to the highest standards of safety. The 16-tonne container in which they were shipped meets high environmental standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To give some context to this matter, I recall&mdash;I rely on my memory in this&mdash;that when the question of a high temperature incinerator was being discussed for establishment in the Northern Territory at Tennant Creek, I saw some of the figures about the amounts of wastes generally that are moved around. France has commercial facilities that make money out of disposing of this waste. I saw a figure that indicated that some 700,000 tonnes of waste generally were imported into France each year from Germany alone. Just to put it into context, this container held 16 tonnes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department interpreted `transit states' to mean those states through which wastes were actually shipped, that is, involving crossing borders and customs barriers, which I do not think is an unreasonable interpretation. Subsequent advice from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was that a broader interpretation should be taken to include countries in whose ports a ship that is transporting the waste was simply to dock, that is, simply to take on fuel. In other words, the sealed container never actually left the ship or was interfered with or touched; it was simply on board. This other interpretation is that that should also be included in what a transit state is. The Department has in the interim been instructed by the Minister to take a very stringent interpretation of these requirements. As I said, we are currently awaiting legal advice as to which one of these interpretations is the correct one.</PARA>

<PARA>Yesterday in the Senate I asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel a question regarding the Defence pension scheme, DFRDB. I asked a specific question, hoping to get a specific answer yesterday. The reason I asked that question is that the future plans of Defence personnel were in limbo and at risk while this very important issue was unresolved. My question arose directly out of the Treasurer's Security in Retirement statement of June this year. The statement provided that, effective from 1 July 1996, all employer contributions to superannuation schemes will be preserved until age 55. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under previous arrangements, DFRDB has been granted an exemption from provisions like this because of the special requirements of Australian Defence Force personnel. These special requirements include compulsory early retiring ages for some members who could be only 45 years old when they leave and who are, therefore, forced to start all over again. In fact, due to the transitory nature of Defence Force life, members are usually unable to settle down, buy a house and do all the other things that normal families can do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The exemption granted to DFRDB allowed Defence personnel, at whatever age they left the Defence Force, after serving their 20 years to commute part of their pension to a lump sum. It is extremely important to Australian Defence Force members who are in the scheme to know that this exemption will continue to apply, despite the provisions of the Security in Retirement statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet all this was thrown into doubt by a rumour that has grown in extent in the past month that the exemption would not be granted. The rumour made its way into the Defence circles, even getting as far as South Australia, where I first heard of it through personal contact with people in the Defence Force. By the time it got there the rumour had become so twisted that some Australian Defence Force personnel were advised that the Government intended to abolish lump sum payments under the new defence superannuation scheme and not under the DFRDB scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a matter of concern for many reasons. One of the reasons why it is so urgent is that Australian Defence Force personnel have to make the choice between the DFRDB pension scheme and the new superannuation scheme, the MSBS, by 30 September, only three weeks away. Yesterday I asked the Government to confirm whether, in the light of the Security in Retirement statement, there would be any change to the DFRDB scheme. I asked whether the Minister, given the confusion in defence circles, would extend the deadline by which personnel have to choose between the old and the new schemes beyond 30 September 1992.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is true; that is exactly what was said. The Treasurer had decided the previous night, Monday, 7 September, that the exemption would be granted allowing Australian Defence Force personnel to commute part of their pension to a lump sum before the age of 55. Senator Ray's office also informed my office that it was aware of the urgency of the matter and that all Australian Defence Force personnel would be notified of the decision immediately.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believed, in good faith, the advice of Senator Ray's office. Last night I put out a press release confirming the good news for Australian Defence Force personnel, while still calling on Senator Ray to publicly assure the Senate of the matters that I asked him about yesterday. Honourable senators can imagine my surprise when my office was contacted this morning by the Armed Forces Federation which knew nothing of the decision made by the Treasurer and was still planning ways to fight this injustice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After many phone calls this morning and much toing-and-froing, I have been assured that the Treasurer has now advised the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) in writing that the exemption will apply. I have been assured yet again that the Australian defence forces will be notified of this decision immediately. It came to my notice as little as 10 minutes ago that Air Force personnel still know nothing about the decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As yet, I have not seen anything in writing. I would very much like to believe the Government but, given the answer of yesterday, I am not so sure that this is the case, especially given that in a debate on the DFRDB this morning Senator Ray mentioned that he was not dreadfully concerned about the fact that defence personnel only have three weeks left to decide between the two schemes. I believe he should be concerned, because if this exemption had not been granted, a major change would have been made to DFRDB. It cannot be equated with just moving the goalposts; it is almost like shifting the game to another field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I realise that it is a difficult subject for everyone to understand but perhaps if I allude to a comparison that Senator Newman made in the Senate this morning it will become clearer. The Senate will recall that relatively recently Commonwealth public servants had to make the choice between two superannuation schemes known as the CSS and the PSS. The situation facing Australian Defence Force personnel in choosing between DFRDB and MSBS is similar, but there are two crucial differences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, there was no provision that in order to qualify for benefits under the CSS public servants had to serve 20 years. Yet that is what defence personnel have to do in order to get benefits from DFRDB. If they leave before their 20 years is up, all they get back is their own contribution. They do not get a lump sum or a pension; they do not even get interest on their contribution from their wages and salaries. If members stay for 15 years they are forced to watch their so-called investment wither away so that when they leave they effectively get back less than they put in. Secondly, there was no attempt to significantly alter the rules to the CSS scheme or the PSS scheme only months before the decision had to be made, and it was not left until just three weeks before the final date to resolve the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the Minister for clarifying the situation in the Senate today but I still believe it is deplorable that Australian Defence Force personnel have been left in limbo for so long, while trying to determine the right decision to make with regard to their future security in retirement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have no dispute with this particular issue, most of which has been canvassed by Senator Ferguson. But I must dispute one aspect of it and that is that he said that my staff contacted him to say that the answer I gave yesterday was incomplete, et cetera. The circumstances are quite simple. Senator Ferguson got the straightforward answer yesterday. In the meantime, when I returned to my office, we finally received the acknowledgment from the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), not as a signed document but as an indication, that he was going to take the action he has taken.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The answer I gave yesterday was accurate. The normal procedure is that when additional information is available I come into this chamber, as I did this afternoon, and make it available. A mistake I obviously made, out of some generosity, was to ask my staff to contact Senator Ferguson straight away to let him know of the updated position. It is a mistake that I will not make in future if he comes in here and dissembles and distorts what my staff said to him. I am sure he has not done that deliberately.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The circumstances were that it was not within my knowledge at Question Time yesterday that the Treasurer had finally made that decision. There was also a gap between the Treasurer making the decision and signing the letter off to me to make sure it was properly drafted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, this is an important issue. When the decision was made as to the date of the cut-off point, 30 September, no-one&mdash;not Senator Ferguson, I, or anyone else&mdash;anticipated that other superannuation changes would be made in the meantime which could affect this.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I pointed out to Senator Ferguson yesterday, it is almost impossible to change the date. The only way to change that date is by way of legislation. It cannot be done by way of administrative direction and it cannot be done by way of new rules or regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliament was conscious of the fact that we had to pick a cut-off date. We did that a year ago. We picked now because, as Senator Ferguson would realise, we cannot leave people to make the decision over a number of years. It would become an administrative nightmare and certain inequities would result. I am also pleased that the Treasurer has finalised this particular matter in terms of whether the members of the old scheme and their lump sums would be affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the same way, I was very pleased to hear Senators Short and Newman clarify the fuzzier aspects of Fightback some months ago as they applied to military superannuation. If Senator Ferguson were to go back and read that document, he would realise that it leaves it wide open. Those two shadow Ministers have indicated verbally that a future coalition government, if it ever be elected, would also look after the armed forces in this particular way.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After a little argy-bargy over the last day in terms of misunderstood timings, the result is there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would not worry so much about people making a decision in the next 20 days. They have been thinking of nothing else for the last year. They know what the possible alternatives are in terms of this morning's debate and in terms of the matters Senator Ferguson has raised. They know that it can go one way or the other, and have made up their minds and now simply have to signal that particular decision. It is not as though they suddenly have to sit down tomorrow and think all this through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A problem in the armed forces is what Senator Ferguson referred to as rumours. As Senator Ferguson probably knows, a rumour starts in one part of the Defence Force in Australia and becomes fact five minutes later. That is the bush telegraph and that is something that is the bane of every defence Minister. As Senator Ferguson said, certain areas of the armed forces suddenly got the idea that the exemption would not be granted and nothing would change that view until a statement was made. That, unfortunately, is a fact of life in the defence forces. If we ever wanted to get this particular signal out we would signal all commanding officers and they would put it on a board. It probably would have been better to brief one person in the Army in confidence, not to tell anyone else, and it would have been around Australia in five minutes. </PARA>

I did not say that the answer was inaccurate; I said that it was not completely accurate. The reason I chose those words so carefully was that in answer to my question the Minister said `there is still discussion occurring', yet when his office rang it said that the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) had made the decision the night before.

Mr President, I want to refer to the statement that you made during Question Time about the low level of behaviour and the low standards that you believe are being exhibited within the chamber at Question Time. I think to some extent you were talking of yesterday as well as today. We on this side are disturbed as well. I think your statement is correct. It is something that obviously all of us have to consider carefully&mdash;particularly those who hold this chamber and institution in high regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, as I understand it, the offence on this side of the chamber is that you feel there are too many interjections. In that regard, if Ministers would comply with the Standing Orders and stick to answering the question, the number of interjections would be very much reduced. Yesterday the Opposition asked four questions in the first hour of Question Time. Today the Opposition asked five questions in one hour. Mr President, it is not surprising, therefore, that the Opposition should find this particularly frustrating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can also understand that Ministers, in the dire predicament in which they find Australia because of the economic mess which is the legacy of their Government, instead of being prepared to answer for their Administration would prefer to come in here and bag the Opposition. But that is not what Question Time is all about. Question Time exists to enable the Opposition to question Ministers about their administration. That is the opportunity to which we are entitled. We should be able to get answers from Ministers on subjects that are within their brief. We should not have to suffer the abuse that we receive in respect of matters which are totally irrelevant to the questions that are asked. If Ministers would stick to that responsibility and stick to the Standing Orders, there would be far fewer interjections and the standard of behaviour generally in the Senate would be raised to the benefit of the institution and all of us who are part of it. </PARA>

In minor mitigation, I must say that a couple of the answers that were given yesterday, such as the one asked by Senator Hill about Cambodia, were extremely serious and needed a full response. Tolerance is usually shown when the Opposition asks such a question and there may be something like an eight-minute crafted response. This should not apply to every answer.

Speaking for a Labor government that is proud to have introduced the Order of Australia to recognise Australians with particular Australian distinction, we are not going to bring back the old imperial order. It says a lot about a country and its standing and recognition, its self-identity, its self-definition of what constitutes an independent, sovereign country, that we do not wish to abrogate an order of imperial recognition that belongs to another country, no matter how esteemed in terms of our own origins.</PARA></TALK.START>

The motion provided for a further knighthood and dameship at the level of knight bachelor within the Order of Australia&mdash;and I hope the Minister can hear that&mdash;as a means of encouraging positive community perceptions of our existing and historical links with the Crown. It did not say go back. If the Minister listens for a minute, he might get the facts right. He has always been pretty quick to stir, but if he listens for a minute he might learn something.

It keeps pretending that things are not nearly so bad; that things are getting better all the time. It is almost as if Government members were in some kind of fairyland.

For example, they look at the 960,000 people who are presently unemployed&mdash;11 per cent of the work force&mdash;and say that that is it. The Government does not take regard of all the hidden unemployed&mdash;all the underemployed&mdash;in Australia and I will deal with them later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. One can say that this is no sudden trend. In fact, it has been going on for a few years, particularly under this Government as this Government's policies have priced people out of work. It is even more serious when one looks at what has happened to private enterprise and how the number of jobs there has been decimated. A report in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> showed that over the last 12 months something like 180,000 private sector jobs were wiped out, but, of course, only 19,000 public sector jobs were wiped out. So it is in the private sector&mdash;the engine room of Australia; the place that does things, creates things and establishes Australia's wealth&mdash;that the jobs are being destroyed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In figures prepared by the Australian Bureau of Statistics for up to February of this year, we see that a total of about 300,000 private sector jobs were wiped out over the last four years, but only something like 8,400 public sector jobs were lost. The reduction in full time jobs in the private sector was about 338,000. When one takes account of part time jobs it is about 300,000. The situation is that the very sector which is being belted by this Government is the sector which is the major employer&mdash;the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last five years the number of people in part time jobs has grown by 4.3 per cent a year while the country has been losing full time jobs at the rate of 4.6 per cent a year. In the 12 months to February there was an even greater fall in the number of full time jobs, when 243,000 full time jobs disappeared, or 5.4 per cent of total full time jobs. This is a disastrous situation which is not reflected in the unemployment statistics. That is the key point, but what is this Government doing about it? Of course, that is the key question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are about 600,000 people who are now underemployed according to the latest figures put out by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. They are working part time and they want to work longer. Those figures are up something like two-thirds&mdash;62 per cent&mdash;in two years. In some States there is an absolute disaster, for example, South Australia and Victoria. Fortunately, the people of Victoria will soon have the opportunity to express their views about this matter. There is a massive level of underemployment which has brought about a most interesting situation: the combination of the officially unemployed and the underemployed gives an unemployment and underemployment rate of about 17 per cent in Australia now, compared to only 12.8 per cent in the last recession of 1982-83. Yet we keep on hearing from this Government these nonsensical claims that somehow this recession is not all that bad; that somehow if the figures are fiddled enough, the Government can pretend that there is not this kind of crisis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned that this Government is doing absolutely nothing to fix this problem except to throw money at some public sector jobs. We have already seen that there has been a very small reduction in the number of jobs in the public sector but a massive fall in jobs in the private sector. What is the Government doing to create jobs in an area that provides 70 per cent of the jobs in Australia? Private enterprise is where all the jobs have been, where all the jobs are being killed off, and where this Government is doing nothing to resolve the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has One Nation done to create any jobs or to end this jobs disaster? Since its release in February, a further 28,000 full time jobs have been wiped out in Australia. Unemployment has jumped by 52,000 over that period, and the unemployment rate has risen from 10.5 per cent when One Nation&mdash;or `One Notion'&mdash;came out to 11 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has it done in these States that are now facing State elections? In Queensland, in the four months since One Nation came out&mdash;the proposal that was supposed to rescue Australia&mdash;unemployment has gone up by another 26,000 approximately to 169,500, or 11.2 per cent, which is worse than the national average and represents a sudden deterioration since the 9.7 per cent unemployment rate in April. We can now understand why Premier Goss is rushing to an election. All of a sudden, from being the State with the lowest rate of unemployment, his State has worse unemployment than the Australian average. So we know why, before it deteriorates further, Premier Goss has had to rush to cover up the clear indications that his State is as bad as, in fact worse than, the average in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Victoria, which is a basket case, over the last four months unemployment has worsened by a further 24,000-odd, and the unemployment rate is up from 11.2 per cent to 11.9 per cent. We all know that Victoria is a disaster and that Premier Kirner is serving out her last days in that job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at youth unemployment. In Victoria, the proportion of young people aged 15 to 19 looking for full time work is 43.2 per cent of the work force. We will hear the usual imaginative accounting from Senator Cook, who will pretend that it is nothing near as serious as that, that it is only about 10 per cent. He, like the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly), has the ability to convert disasters into minimal statistics. The fact is that 43 per cent of young Australians seeking full time work in Victoria cannot find any. The unemployment rate for adults in that State, not seasonally adjusted, is about 11.3 per cent, which gives a total non-seasonally adjusted figure for Victoria of 12.8 per cent. That is a disaster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Queensland is now getting near that figure. In Queensland, the number of people looking for full time work but unable to find it is up to 12 per cent. This is a severe reversal in recent times. In Queensland, the youth unemployment rate is about 28 per cent. I concede that that is nothing like as bad as it is in Victoria, but nonetheless it is steadily worsening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One Nation has done nothing for Australia. Attempts by the Government to try to resolve the unemployment problem have been a farce. We heard more of that farce today when the Government tried to justify how its so-called waterfront reform results in companies having to go to other nations such as New Zealand to do their processing or whatever it is they do because of the failure of industrial relations reform and waterfront reform in Australia to provide reasonable sorts of opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a clear need to fix up this problem. A recent paper prepared by the Government Centre of Social and Economic Modelling demonstrates that almost 11 per cent of the incomes of the poorest 10 per cent of households is spent in paying Labor's hidden wholesale and excise taxes. Here we have a government which is belting around the ears the poorest people in Australia: 11 per cent of their income goes to pay Labor's hidden wholesale tax. By the way, that even includes taxes on toilet paper, soap and detergent. People do not realise this, but they are the sorts of taxes this Government is imposing, as well as adding new taxes such as the one on ice cream and flavoured milk. The people of Australia do not realise that this Government has imposed those sorts of taxes on them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government claims that a GST would somehow be unfair. The fact is that 11 per cent of poor people's incomes is spent on paying Labor's hidden taxes but only 5 per cent of rich people's incomes is spent on paying Labor's hidden taxes. That claim is not according to me; that is according to the Government's own Centre of Social and Economic Modelling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth Treasury has estimated that the tax changes in Fightback alone&mdash;that is, the abolition of the wholesale sales tax, payroll tax and the fuel excise and their replacement with a goods and services tax that is fully rebatable for business&mdash;would result in a $5.4 billion reduction in costs for the manufacturing sector. Remember: where are the jobs being lost? In the private sector of Australia. Here is one section of the private sector&mdash;manufacturing industry&mdash;whose costs would be reduced by $5.4 billion under the coalition's Fightback plan. That is exactly the sort of action required to give the private sector the opportunity to offer more jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fightback is a more jobs policy which leads to lower taxes and massively increased job opportunities and takes the heavy burden of government taxes off the very sector that has been so hit with taxes by this Government that it has had to shed hundreds of thousands of jobs while the Government's own public sector has increased. This Government in this Budget is trying to solve the unemployment situation largely by putting more people on the public payroll. They are not lasting and sustainable jobs; they are jobs aimed at covering up the real unemployment level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that it is not only the Government's own bodies that are demonstrating the benefits of the sort of structural reform the Opposition wants to introduce and which this Government is attacking in an extraordinary way.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a debate on a matter of public importance, which is a formal procedure in this chamber to debate matters put on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> by the Opposition, the Democrats, Independents or the Government. This proposal is one put by the Opposition. It alleges that the Budget has failed to provide long term sustainable jobs and that the Government has failed to undertake significant structural reform to address the problems of the economy. Both of those allegations are false. Both of those allegations are consistent with the Opposition's campaign to talk down the economy, to knock the economy, to knock the recovery, to knock the Australian dollar, and to knock, in the most recent manifestation of this carping criticism, Australian car manufacturers for daring to differ with the views of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a knockers' proposal. We have just heard a knocker's speech. I say that in order to use the English language precisely. If it had been a speech which contained program, which compared a program of how recovery can be engaged in to the program laid out in One Nation or the program laid out in the Budget, it would not have been properly characterised as a knocker's speech. But it did not contain such a program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It contained this chanting mantra: Fightback, Fightback, Fightback, which is, by the impartial analysis of the Australian Treasury, a proposal which, hopefully, will never see the light of day, but which will impose higher taxes and lower wages on Australia and, in its most recent manifestation, as I have said, which will reduce protection to help wipe out critical areas of the Australian manufacturing industry. So the recipe for recovery, the recipe to restore confidence in the economy and the so-called recipe for growth is one of higher taxes, lower wages, less protection and more damage to the competitive edge of Australian manufacturing industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have not seen a comparative manifesto. We have not seen a comparative program. What this Government has been consistently honest and straightforward about is admitting, realistically and sensibly, what are the problems in the Australian economy and then trying, with practical means, to address those. In a practical, realistic way, the Australian economy is now recovering from the recession faster than other international economies of a comparable nature. That is of considerable merit to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also recovering along an economic strategy line similar to the line now being used in Japan. Japan is, after all, one of the most successful capitalist countries in the world. Japan has suffered the ravages of the international economic recession, just as Australia, Europe and North America have. Japan has adopted the strategy of One Nation, but has done it in a bolder way than we have done. We have done it in a more modest, careful way, but it has brought down a budget which stimulates its economy, which invests in public infrastructure spending and, by that investment, pulls through the private sector into areas of greater growth, as the private sector supplies the goods and services to the investment in the public sector and the improvements in infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have heard is a knocker's and a critic's rendition of the problem. We have not heard any constructive alternative. I think that simply puts the performance here this afternoon in line with the immaturity and the erratic performance recently displayed by Dr Hewson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two elements to this proposal&mdash;employment is one and structural change is another. On employment, let me say that in the One Nation statement and in the Budget we set out directly to stimulate growth in the economy by investment in public infrastructure. In One Nation, there is investment in rail and port facilities and road facilities around Australia, all of the materials for which will be supplied by the private sector and therefore lift growth in the private sector, and there is investment in training and skills through a massive commitment to the technical and further education program. We will have a skilled economy able to undertake sophisticated work in a growingly complex and sophisticated world. They were the positive initiatives in One Nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Budget, we have gone straight to the level of government that is closest to the ordinary Australian. We have gone straight to the level of local government. It has told us that it has significant programs ready to roll. We have provided the funds for those programs to move immediately. This will result in a huge commitment to local government and investment in capital expenditure by local government, as local government sets about improving the community assets at local level accessible by ordinary Australians and not by elites. We will fund that. This will create work in the construction industry. This will create work in all the industries that supply that construction industry, right across the scope of the economy. These are positive stimulatory measures. So, in terms of employment, we will be putting people in work. We will provide training. We will stimulate growth and we will keep inflation down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our commitment on the wages front is to maintain Australia's historically low level of inflation, as achieved under us. That must be compared to the consumption tax and the proposal of the Opposition. It must be compared to the element of the consumption tax which will take $7 billion out of the economy. At a time when the economy requires to be stimulated by a commitment from government, the Opposition's consumption tax proposal will remove $7 billion, deflate the economy and turn it into a downward spiral as growth turns negative and unemployment figures ratchet further up. It will kill all the employment prospects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other element of this proposal which has been put this afternoon is about restructuring. I will talk a bit later about the reform steps which we have successfully undertaken. Greater reform than has ever occurred in the Australian economy has occurred in the last six to eight years under our Government. It is a reform which is racking up positive achievement and results&mdash;reform without conflict, reform without dispute and reform without the social division inherent in the unequal, unfair proposals of the Opposition right across the board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I talk about the particular steps we have taken, let us look at the scoreboard, because it is important to see whether the reform we have taken is achieving the results that we hope it will achieve. The best area of the scoreboard to look at is that of manufacturing exports. The greatest joy of any person looking at economic statistics out of Australia most recently has been to look at the area of manufacturing exports. This indicates a fundamental transformation in the nature of the Australian economy, as we sell more of the manufactured goods that we make in this country overseas, and as we provide more skilled and sophisticated employment for Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are moving the Australian economy away from being a farm and a quarry to an economy which sells to the world&mdash;and a competitive, cut-throat world it is&mdash;competitive manufactured goods. If we look at the current performance, we will find that manufactured goods now are worth, in their export value, $15 billion to the Australian economy. We now export one-fifth of all things we make in this country. Manufactured exports are second on the list of exports and are ahead of agriculture. This used to be a country that rode on the sheep's back. That is no longer the case. This country exports minerals and manufactured goods in that order, with an increasing component of the manufacturing sector, being elaborately transformed manufactures, and then it exports agricultural goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other interesting statistic is that, in the six years to 1991, the growth in manufactured exports in Australia has been the fastest in the whole of the OECD and is twice the average of the OECD. So compared to our own economic peers, we have done better and we have doubled the performance of the average of our economic peers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two elements upon which this so-called matter of public importance has been based are employment and restructuring. On both fronts, we have positive plans which will turn the result around and which already have improved the performance of the Australian economy in comparison to like economies suffering equally with us from the ravages of international recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me now go to the Budget and One Nation in particular. Over the next four years, the effect of the Budget and the One Nation statement will be to add another 800,000 new and sustainable jobs to the market. This will return our jobs growth to the record levels of jobs growth that we racked up during the 1980s when Australia led the OECD and the world in its ability to create employment. This will generate the necessary economic growth and confidence to keep the economy going. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out, as ought to be well known in this place, that during the recovery from the 1983 recession, the level of inflation fell, the level of employment rose and the level of real wages fell but with compensatory payments through reduced taxes and improved social wage to households so that living standards were maintained. That was our record until now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We intend to replicate that because we are the only party able to assume government in this country that has a wages policy. It has a wages policy based on providing the best and most efficient economic outcomes for the economy but also the fairest and most reasonable outcomes for the citizens of the economy. We have a wages policy which is not the law of the jungle, the devil take the hindmost and `If you have no bargaining clout you suffer with a wages reduction'. We have a best and fairest wages policy which enshrines the cooperative ethic in wage fixation and industrial relations and not the conflict and confrontationist ethic that so typifies that of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we approached the question of the Budget and One Nation, we identified five important elements: first, that there needs to be a significant and sufficient fiscal boost to the economy; secondly, that the levels and investment in skill and training in the economy need to be lifted to skill up the Australian work force to make it a more sophisticated work force best able to absorb high levels of technology and best able to adapt to the new emerging manufacturing cultures; and, thirdly, that we undertake the necessary structural changes in the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The One Nation statement set out a program of structural reform for the economy that has been achieved and that is to be continued. Many of the elements of our structural reform program bear repeating. We have now reformed the finance industry. Telecommunications and aviation, central to a big country like Australia, have been reformed significantly. We have completed their restructuring and placed them on a more competitive footing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have achieved significant reform on the Australian waterfront and in Australian shipping. I know that this achieves a horse laugh from members of the Opposition because they cling tightly to their prejudices and bigotries about the Australian waterfront and about the performance and efficiency of our coastal shipping. I simply refer those opposite to the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> written by that newspaper's economics specialist writer, Ross Gittins, in which he pays due recognition to the significant changes that have occurred there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well, the Government has invested significantly in this nation's infrastructure so that it runs efficiently and effectively. The national rail freight initiative is one of the elements of that investment which is transforming the efficiency with which freight is moved around this country. It is also instituting a highway of rail around Australia which will operate to the level of the best in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are establishing a national electricity grid&mdash;no longer six States all with their own independent electricity generating and distribution authorities, some of them overgenerating, some of them undergenerating, and with inequities applying between States. We now have the States&mdash;one of the hardest achievements in the Federation&mdash;along the eastern and southern seaboard of this country agreeing to pool their electricity generating competence and develop a national grid system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Importantly in structural reform, we are easing down tariff protection to gradually expose Australian industry to world competition. No big bang, no sharp shock, no overnight change which leaves industry defenceless in the horrifying terrain of international competition to be wiped out or burnt to the ground, but a gradual easing over time so that there is stretched targeting encouraging more efficiencies and greater international competitiveness. We are doing that in stark contrast to what the Opposition proposes on tariffs. Whether its carefully crafted phrase `negligible tariff' or whether their real intent, zero tariff, is the order of the day, what is clear to this nation's industry is that there will not be a car industry in Australia if the Opposition ever gains the Treasury benches in this Parliament. That is not the Government saying that; the leaders of industry are saying that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we came to the debate about tariffs and our changes in tariff reform, we asked ourselves as a government, `What sort of industry does a modern industrial State such as Australia require?'. One of the key elements of a modern industrial State is a car industry because so much other manufacturing hangs off a car industry. So much other supply of componentry, so much other electronics, so much other sophisticated manufacturing hangs off a car industry. If there is no car industry, there is none of the rest of the industry that supplies those parts either. So we structured our tariff reforms in order that this country will have a car industry and so that this country, as well, will have a textile, clothing and footwear industry, both of which will be more competitive, more efficient and more productive but both of which will exist, so that people who live in Elizabeth, South Australia, in Geelong, Victoria, in Fishermans Bend and in other places where cars are made in this country know that they will have work to go to when we continue in power and not the dole as the Opposition promises them because of their removal of protection and the wiping out of those industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth and important element of our program is that of social justice. We talk in this place often about economic efficiency as if economic efficiency distributes its gains fairly to the community and not in an unequal way to people who are best placed to take advantage. We recognise that there are people in this community unable to protect themselves for whatever reason. In their case, there needs to be a caring hand of government reaching down to look after them. Therefore, in our Budget, we provided for a significant reform and boost to the health care system of this country&mdash;so essential to a good quality of life for ordinary Australians. We provided a big improvement to community housing programs, We lifted the age pension above the indexed level that we proposed and we have increased rental assistance to those in need of rental support. That ought to be compared with the $10 billion worth of expenditure that would be cut out of the Budget under the so-called consumption tax package by reductions in expenditure on health, community services and welfare so that in an Opposition future, if there ever is one, the poor will suffer and be made the victims of society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fifth area that I go to in my last few seconds is that of industrial relations.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a certain sadness in entering this debate. We have had debate similar to this one before. I think the public is becoming sick and tired of the shadow-boxing which is going on in this place.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, the differences are not between the Government and the coalition, both of which are pursuing policies of economic rationalism, but rather between what is going on in Canberra and what is going on in the rest of Australia. The divide is there. The divide is felt very acutely by ordinary citizens who are, as Senator Baume said, losing their jobs. Industries are going to the wall. People do not see any hope with either the Government or the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So at one level we can indeed agree with the matter of public importance that has been put forward by Senator Baume this afternoon:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The failure of the Government's Budget to provide long term sustainable jobs and the Government's refusal to undertake the significant structural reform necessary to address the economic crisis facing Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition is pursuing precisely the same sorts of economic policies, based on the same blind economic ideology, as the Government. It is particularly cynical of Senator Baume to begin his remarks by accusing the Government of not observing what was actually going on&mdash;`failing to recognise the problem' was his term. It is not only the Government that is failing to recognise the problem. We have heard the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) talk about how the economy is doing so marvellously. In fact, our debt is still increasing hand over fist. There has also been a failure to recognise that Senator Baume and the coalition would continue the same sorts of policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister, Senator Cook, has just referred to the reductions in tariffs. As we know, the coalition would be even more vigorous and more brutal in the way it would reduce tariffs. There is no doubt at all that many industries would go to the wall. One could accuse Senator Baume also of not opening the window, looking outside and seeing what is really going on in the rest of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we would agree with the wording of the matter of public importance, we totally reject the implication which lies behind the words&mdash;the implication that somehow Australia would do better under a coalition government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In that connection, let me remind the Opposition that of all the OECD countries we are the second lowest in terms of taxation. Opposition members are committed to greed. They want more money for themselves. They want more money for their mates. They want very little money for government which will actually address the serious problems of unemployment and the demise of Australian industry. It is not a matter of big government; it is a matter of adequate government to address this problem&mdash;something that the coalition totally rejects. There is nothing whatsoever in its Fightback package which directly attacks the problem which the Opposition has identified this afternoon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition is saying that economic rationalism, more vigorously applied, more brutally applied, will somewhere further down the track turn the economy round and, out of that revamped economy, will come jobs and a return to a vibrant Australian industry. It has not happened. It is not going to happen. It has not happened anywhere else. The Opposition is simply ignoring reality, as Senator Baume himself accused the Government of doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition is right at one level, in calling for structural reform. But the sort of reform it would propose, as I have said, would increase unemployment, increase poverty and increase the gap between the rich and the poor. In that connection, the Minister a moment ago said that we were following the Japanese model. The Opposition is committed to increasing inequity. We have seen that under the Government's program. Since 1984 there has been a marked increased in inequity in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What one notices about Japan since the Second World War is that there has been remarkable equity across its economy. Business managers do not get paid exorbitant salaries compared with the workers. That contrasts very sharply with the situation which obtained in the 1920s. Japanese industry was very brutal to its workers. So it has been pursued as a deliberate policy by the Japanese to equalise the sharing of wealth, the sharing of those things which are created by productive enterprise. But Australia is pursuing, and the Opposition would pursue, quite a different policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see that, for instance, in Dr Hewson's proposal for a $3 youth wage. Dr Hewson's capital assets alone indicate that he must have been earning about $100 per hour for every hour since he was 20 years of age. Yet what he is offering youth is $3. What Dr Hewson is about and what the Opposition front bench is about is greed in protecting their privileged position, not caring a damn about what is going on outside in the street. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats, on the other hand, have proposed a fully funded way of addressing this problem in our <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Getting to Work</EMPHASIS> document. We recognise that the problems of unemployment and indebtedness need to be tackled not by increasing the deficit, which is what the Government is proposing, but rather by increasing taxation, by actually finding the funds which will address this problem and also by shifting money out of the defence area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We recognise that the problem in defending Australia is no longer defending Australia against an external military threat&mdash;all the experts say that we do not face in the foreseeable future any external military threat whatsoever&mdash;but addressing those situations within the country which are a very severe threat to our future. There are problems such as this desperate number of 10 per cent, 11 per cent or more unemployed; youth unemployment; the middle-aged unemployed; the people who are disillusioned; the people who are alienated; and the people who are turning to drugs, crime and suicide as a way out of their predicament. We recognise that they are the problems that this country faces and, appropriately, we should shift a substantial amount of our defence budget across into restructuring industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We recognise that, rather than going for smaller government and lower taxation, which is what both the Government and Opposition are committed to, and recognising that we are a very low tax country&mdash;contrary to what the coalition tries to tell the Australian people&mdash;it is appropriate for those of us who are in employment to pay some portion of our income by way of higher taxation. We are proposing a jobs levy of 1.25 per cent structured in exactly the same way as the Medicare levy, to create a fund, not of a few hundred million dollars, which the Government is talking about, or nothing at all, which the Opposition is talking about in its Fightback package, but a fund of $2.5 billion every year for the next five years which could be used to address the problem of unemployment, to create a large number of, as the Opposition says, `sustainable jobs', jobs which will produce long term environmental and/or social benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the criticisms one would make of the Opposition is that the Minister has talked about the money going to local government. When one talks to local government and looks to see where that money is going, one sees that there are no good criteria laid down to ensure that that money will go into areas which will ensure long term social, long term environmental and long term sustainable benefit to the community. Some of those programs of spending are certainly in danger of falling into the trap which we saw in the old RED scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition is talking about waterfront reform. Certainly, one can improve matters on the waterfront very substantially. However, the thing which has been identified more particularly is to do with management rather than labour on the waterfront&mdash;the way in which the waterfront is actually managed. The Opposition fails to recognise that as we improve efficiency on the waterfront, that will reduce both the costs of imports and the costs of exports, so imports will be just as competitive within our economy as they are today. That in itself does not make the Australian economy any more efficient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has repeatedly extolled the virtues of Fightback in terms of the abolition of payroll tax. Recognising that this is a State tax and that it will require the cooperation of the States before it can actually do that, nonetheless, the Opposition fails to recognise that because its goods and services tax is a tax at the point of consumption, it implies a tax both on the labour component and the resource component of all goods and services made.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many recognise that tourism is a very important industry in Australia. There are currently no taxes whatsoever in that industry. If the GST is imposed on the high labour content of the tourist industry, it will impose a very severe penalty on an industry which many people regard as one which needs to be encouraged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The failure of the Government and the Opposition to support an inquiry into tariff reductions needs to be put fairly and squarely on the record either by way of an inquiry here or by way of a Senate inquiry. Senator Spindler, from the Australian Democrats, has commenced a very comprehensive inquiry, supported by a large number of both union and industry groups. The inquiry has taken a considerable amount of evidence, indicating that the reduction in tariffs is sucking imports into the Australian economy and decimating Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had this message from the Victorian Employers Federation, the Victorian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the textile, clothing and footwear union's Federal Secretary, the Chemical Industries Council of Australia, the Heavy Engineering Manufacturing Association, the Queensland Sugar Corporation, the Council of Small Business Organisations, the Federation of Automotive Products Manufacturers and the Metal Trades Industry Organisation, among a number of others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the Opposition to continue to abuse industry in the way it has and, more recently, as we have seen with the motor vehicle industry&mdash;ignoring again, shutting its eyes to the reality of the way in which its reduction in tariffs, part of its Fightback package, will decimate the Australian industry which is left&mdash;flies absolutely in the face of the claim which Senator Baume made in his opening remarks that the Government is not recognising the problem. The Opposition is also failing to recognise the problem and will apply even worse so-called remedies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government and the Opposition are pursuing a scorched earth policy with respect to Australian industry. It is their policies which are leading to the decimation of Australian industry, to the high level of unemployment and to the large and growing foreign debt.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fascinating, when we are debating a matter of public importance such as this about jobs, that today in Question Time Senator Hill asked Senator Cook how many jobs have been created as a consequence of the One Nation statement and Senator Cook, the Minister responsible, could not give an answer. Does that tell a story or does it not? Obviously, not one single, solitary job has been created as a result of the One Nation statement. The Minister talks about other jobs that have supposedly been created. Senator Baume has consistently asked him how many are full time and how many are part time and he cannot answer. What is this Minister doing?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we get, endlessly, the politics of envy of the Australian Democrats.

The Democrats do not know and they do not care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have the Government and the Australian Democrats in collusion to put more people out of work. I think that is a very tragic state of affairs. Any claims whatsoever that this 1992 Budget will make any impact on Australia's unemployment tragedy can hardly be taken seriously and has, fortunately, not been taken seriously by many people in the community and a number of Government senators and members. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The failure of this Budget is inevitable, given the refusal of this tired, discredited Government to tackle the structural problems that cripple wealth creation and destroy incentive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats have come in here today saying, and they have said it repeatedly, that under Fightback the Opposition cannot abolish the highest single tax on employment&mdash;that is, payroll tax&mdash;because it is a State tax and we cannot do it without the consent of the State governments. Every time dopey Democrats say that, it proves that they have not read <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS>. If they had read <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> they would have discovered, much to their amazement, that every single, solitary State Premier or Leader of the Opposition has at some stage in the recent past supported the removal of payroll tax. If Labor Premiers want their States to be the only State to say, `No, we don't want to abolish payroll tax', be it on their heads. But it is simply wrong for the Australian Democrats to come in here and pretend that we will not be able to deliver that. If Senator Coulter had read <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> he would have known that they all support the abolition of payroll tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter also had the temerity to come in here and say that the tourism industry currently has no tax on it whatsoever. That is wrong and he knows it, and if he does not know it, surely he should not be a leader of a political party. Does he not know that there is payroll tax on the employees? Does he not know that there is a fuel tax on the fuel and transportation of things associated with the tourism industry, to say nothing of people who jump in their motor vehicles and travel from point A to point B? They have paid tax on their car, they have paid tax on their tyres, they have paid tax on their parts and they have paid tax on their fuel&mdash;the whole thing. They get to the motel and there is tax on the bed, there is tax on the blanket, there is tax on the floor coverings, there is tax on the light globe, there is tax on the cash register and there is tax on the computer. There is tax on everything throughout the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter comes into this chamber and says that the industry is not taxed. It is absolutely remarkable to think that he could be so ill-informed. Of course, under Fightback all of those taxes will be removed. By removing payroll tax, jobs will be created. Does this Government want to take that hard decision and remove all of those taxes to create jobs? Will the Democrats commit themselves to agreeing to remove those taxes to create jobs? No they will not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Budget is clearly based on the premise of `don't just do something; stand there'. This Government is just standing there, hoping that something else will happen and that someone else will do it. The only thing that the Government has done in this Budget is a bit of old style pork-barrelling. Is it not remarkable that one of the largest sums to go to local government in my State of Western Australia happens to be allocated to the most marginal Labor seat in Australia&mdash;the seat of Stirling which, thankfully, in the next few months will have a new member. Eoin Cameron will best serve that seat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a situation at the moment where, to retain the sitting member, this Government has engaged in the old practice of pork-barrelling by pushing money into the seat of Stirling and hoping to high heaven that it will all come good. That is what the Government has been doing unashamedly in Victoria. Look at the recent comments that were made on the disastrous economic state of Victoria by Ian Macfarlane, the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia. He said:</PARA>

<PARA>He commented that only 0.3 of a percentage point of the 4.7 percentage point gap in employment falls between Victoria and the rest of Australia could be attributed to manufacturing protection reductions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Premier Kirner is trying to say that the removal of tariffs&mdash;the policy of both the Government and the Opposition&mdash;is going to cost her State jobs. Yet the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank clearly points out that it is her fault. It is her fault&mdash;not the fault of some pixie at the bottom of the garden. Of course, that simply means that the Victorian Government is 94 per cent to blame for the economic collapse of that State. It does not mind how many jobs it keeps on losing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a Budget that will saddle Australia with $50 billion of debt by 1995-96. It is a Budget designed to create difficulties for what Labor now knows will be the next Liberal-National government. They do not have any responsibility in this Budget because they know that they will not be in government for any longer than next year. So this Budget is irrelevant to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The failure to create long term sustainable jobs is compounding what is already a massive human disaster. Conservatively speaking, there are in Australia 926,000 unemployed people, together with 82,000 workers on short time in supposedly full time employment and 591,000 people working part time who want to increase their hours. I say that there are supposedly only 926,000 people unemployed&mdash;a million people unemployed&mdash;because the real number is in fact much larger than that. The real number is well over a million people. This Government has not included in these figures people who might have a job for one hour a week. This makes them ineligible to be counted in the unemployment figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unemployment figures do not include people who are in receipt of sickness benefits or various other forms of pension. Some of these people are not sick and they did not need to be pensioned out. Their real problem is that they are unemployed. This Government has constantly shifted them off into other areas. Therefore, the real figure would be closer to 1 1/2 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are at least 140,000 discouraged job seekers who have simply just stopped looking. Seventy five per cent of these people are women who have been kept out of the job market not only by the Keating recession but also because of the continual refusal of Labor to allow the industrial reforms that will let them into the work force.

What chance have those children got? Does this Government care? No, it does not because it keeps on increasing taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are in the throes of debating in the Senate this very day increases in tax.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor boasts of the jobs that were created before the Keating recession. But we need to remember that for every 100 jobs created between 1983 and 1988, unemployment was reduced by only nine people because of Labor's refusal to offend the ACTU by undertaking structural reform. The Labor Party simply will not undertake real structural reform because its masters, the ACTU, will not allow it to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government and the dopey Democrats are saying that young people should be denied a minimum youth wage. I stress the word `minimum' because this is another area where this Government and the Australian Democrats continue to mislead the Australian public by somehow suggesting that a suggested minimum youth wage is going to become a mandatory youth wage. They know that that is not true and yet they hope people will believe it if they say it often enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely it is better to have young people employed at $3 an hour, or $3.50 an hour depending on their age, than not have them employed at all and consigned to the tip forever. We are facing a very real prospect of having young people leaving school, going onto the dole and then going onto the pension, never having worked a day in their lives. That is not the type of Australia we want to be saddled with. That is not the type of Australia young people wish to look forward to. We want to change that. And it can be changed. The only way it can be changed is by real reforms&mdash;structural reform and taxation reform, and making sure that jobs are available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this Government simply puts the blinkers on and pork-barrels its marginal seats. It has no intention of creating policies for all Australians. It has no intention of creating policies that will benefit young people. It has no intention of creating policies that will benefit people over 40 years of age who have dependent children and who have lost their jobs. Many face the real prospect of never getting another job. The Government does not care about them. All that members of this Government are now interested in is pork-barrelling and pouring money into marginal seats so that they can selfishly try to retain government and retain their jobs.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The failure of the Government's Budget to provide long-term sustainable jobs . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I reject this proposition outright. This proposition is totally hypocritical coming from an Opposition which, when last in government, destroyed thousands and thousands of jobs in Australia; it is a clear case of the pot calling the kettle black. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberals now want to embark on a new proposal to destroy more jobs in the Australian economy. They have the motor vehicle industry in South Australia and Victoria firmly in their sights with this proposal to have minimal tariffs for the Australian motor vehicle industry. They want to tear down the tariff wall that protects the South Australian and Victorian motor vehicle industries from an influx of imported motor vehicles&mdash;and in the process they would destroy thousands and thousands of jobs in the Australian car industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that the Australian car industry does need tariff protection. It is supplying a small market. It cannot get the economies of scale which are achieved by overseas producers. The firms in the industry know that. The companies themselves know that tariff protection is necessary for the Australian motor vehicle industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor has taken a number of actions in recent years to help promote long term job creation in the Australian economy. I want to focus particularly at this point in time on the question of inflation&mdash;on price rises and on Labor's record of getting price rises out of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to go back to the rhetoric of previous Liberal administrations. I can remember them saying things like, `High inflation works to destroy jobs in the Australian economy'. That was their rhetoric in earlier years of this decade&mdash;that high inflation destroys jobs in the Australian economy; that it takes work away from many potential employees by pushing up wages and cost structures and, therefore, by making firms uncompetitive. That was the Liberal Party rhetoric&mdash;fight inflation first; fight inflation to provide for long term jobs in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the Liberal Party left office in 1983 with inflation running in the double digit range. It left office with an inflation rate for the year&mdash;the rate for price rises&mdash;of 11 1/2 per cent. Under the Labor administration, the rate of price rises is no longer in the double digit range. In fact, the last consumer price index for the June quarter showed very clearly that we have now an annual rate of inflation in this country of 1.2 per cent. That was the figure recorded by the consumer price index. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, inflation now under the Labor administration is just over one-tenth of the 11 1/2 per cent rate that the Liberals left Australia with in 1983. So, on the basis of the Liberals' rhetoric taken at its face value, if it is true that inflation destroys jobs, the fact that Labor has got inflation largely out of the system and is making further progress in that regard must mean that it is underpinning long term job creation in the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that Australian firms are now more competitive. They are in a better cost position relative to overseas suppliers of competing products as a result of these policies of getting inflation out of the system. It is very interesting indeed to look at how our inflation rate now compares with the rates of our overseas trading partners. The average inflation rate&mdash;the average rate of price rises per annum&mdash;in the countries with which we mainly trade is now 3 1/4 per cent per annum. That is the average of all the countries. In Australia, as I have pointed out, our inflation rate is below 2 per cent per annum. So every month that goes by means that Australian firms are becoming more price competitive because the Australian cost structure is not rising as fast as cost structures facing firms in other countries. So, basically, looking at the Liberal Party rhetoric about inflation destroying jobs, we have got inflation out of the system; therefore, we are doing a lot for long term job creation in the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prices have been cut by a range of policy weapons in Australia. There has been the accord with the ACTU in regard to wage rises. Interest rates now being part of the base for the consumer price index means that every time interest rates are reduced inflation comes down&mdash;and that is very important. That is one of the reasons inflation has come down so significantly&mdash;the recurring cuts in interest rates by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has also been the increased competitive pressure on the Australian economy as a result of Labor policy. We have deregulated some particular parts of the Australian economy. I notice, for example, that we now have a third airline flying between major cities in Australia. Under the Liberals we had a policy called the two-airline policy. Labor has opened up the airline industry; there is now a third supplier of airline services in Australia&mdash;and that is symptomatic of the policy change under this Government which is introducing more competitive pressure into the Australian economy and, therefore, helping to keep prices down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn very briefly to interest rates. It is interesting to look at the history of the reductions in interest rates that have occurred. This Government began reducing official interest rates through the operation of monetary policy in around January 1990, 2 1/2 years ago. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is interesting that at that point in time Dr Hewson berated this Government and criticised us in the media. I tell Senator Macdonald that Dr Hewson is on record as saying that we were premature, that we were acting too hastily. In January 1990 he said that we were acting too hastily in bringing interest rates down. Senator Macdonald obviously does not realise that. Dr Hewson is the man who now wants to slash tariffs for the car industry&mdash;the man with the totally rigid, dogmatic thinking who said, in January 1990, that this Government, in embarking on a round of interest rate reductions, was operating prematurely and acting too hastily to ease monetary policy in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had now, I think, 13 rounds of official cuts in interest rates. Rates are now in the range of 5 to 6 per cent for overnight cash. They are very low rates indeed and very competitive. They are very low rates when compared with those in other countries. But the important thing, as I have pointed out, is that every time interest rates have come down, now that interest rates are part of the cost base for the consumer price index calculations, so too has the consumer price index&mdash;and that has been very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that the interest rate reductions are impacting already on the Australian economy in two key sectors. There are two areas where households make major purchases&mdash;very infrequent but very expensive purchases. I refer to homes or dwellings and to new motor vehicles. It is interesting that both sectors are responding to the cuts in interest rates. Those items depend heavily on finance. People do not typically pay for motor vehicles or homes out of their cash incomes. They require finance for them and interest is charged on that finance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the three months to July, on the latest figures we have available, there has been a 22 per cent increase in approvals for new dwellings compared with last year. More than 40,000 new dwellings have been approved in the three months to July compared with 33,000 last year&mdash;a very big increase. The housing industry, of course, is a very labour intensive industry. As this proposal is about job creation, I make the point that, as those housing approvals feed through into bricks and mortar in real housing starts, we are going to see significant increases in employment in the Australian home building industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New motor vehicle registrations also have increased. In the three months to July there were 115,000 registrations of new motor vehicles; in the three months to July last year there were 104,000. So there has been a 10 per cent increase in registrations of new motor vehicles. That is a very important indicator for one of the largest industries in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But again I refer back to the policies of Dr Hewson and Mr McLachlan, who would tear down the tariff wall that protects the largest private sector industry in my State of South Australia, the new motor vehicle industry, and probably the largest private sector industry in the State of Victoria.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to spend some time tonight talking about the profound and grave danger posed to the Australian tourism industry by the goods and services tax&mdash;an issue that I am sure will be of interest to Senator Macdonald from Queensland. It is an absolutely undeniable case that this major, long term creator of jobs in the Australian economy is at risk as a result of the policies of Dr Hewson and the crazy dries in the Liberal Party. Let us look at the record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Look at the job creation under Labor in the tourism and hospitality sector. In 1981-82, under the Liberal Party Government there were 337,000 jobs in the tourism industry. Now, under the Labor Party Government, there are 450,000 jobs in that industry. That is an increase of over 100,000 jobs under this Government. Under the Liberal Government in the early 1980s, there were less than half a million overseas visitors to Australia per annum. Now, under the Labor Government, there are 2 1/2 million overseas visitors coming to Australia per annum. Jobs have been created in the tourism industry because of the increased numbers of visitors coming here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have forecasts from the tourism authorities that suggest that another 200,000 jobs could be created in that industry by the turn of the century. Based on current policies, policies in place now, another 200,000 jobs could be created in that industry. However, we have the spectre of the goods and services tax, a policy of the Liberals, which would bring the tourism industry to its knees. It could destroy any prospect of another 200,000 jobs being created in this major export earning industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia earns $7 billion a year from the tourism industry, yet the Liberal Party wants to subject it to a 15 per cent goods and services tax. It is a major export industry for Australia and these crackpots, the dries driving these crazy policies in the Liberal Party, want to put a 15 per cent tax on this industry. Again, it is a reflection of Dr Hewson's obsession with neatness. He wants a 15 per cent tax on everything. He will not make any exemptions, unless pressure is put on him to do so, as it was recently. He will not even give the tourism industry&mdash;a major export earner&mdash;an exemption from this proposed tax. He has this obsession that, by having a single rate of tax on everything, he will somehow fix the economy's problems, yet he has this blind spot about this major export earner for Australia. I am pleased to say that Liberal Party policy is being driven up a blind alley by these dries and there is no way out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see people in the Liberal Party like Mr Jull, a member from Queensland, proposing that the tax subsidised lunch, the business lunch, be brought back. The rest of us taxpayers would have to subsidise people to go out to lunch. He is proposing that to counteract the damage which will be caused to the tourism and hospitality industry by the goods and services tax. What a crazy policy. Those opposite want a bad policy to cancel out a bad policy. That is what they are on about. It is a serious proposal being floated by these crackpots in the Liberal Party. They want to bring back another bad, crazy, looney policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the reality of the goods and services tax as it affects the tourism industry. In 1990, Sweden brought in a value added tax&mdash;a goods and services tax&mdash;on tourism. What happened in Sweden? A year later there was a 13 per cent fall in the number of inbound tourists. There was a 13 per cent reduction in international visitors to Sweden after the value added tax was brought into that country. If I were Senator Bjelke-Petersen, I would be very worried about what would happen to the tourism industry in Queensland as a result of these crackpot policies being introduced into Australia. This year, Sweden has been forced to lower its VAT rate on tourism because it has acknowledged that it is damaging the industry. France has a concessional rate for tourism; Dr Hewson will not have a concessional rate for tourism. Canada has a rebate for international tourists; Dr Hewson will not be into that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem we face with these crackpot policies is that those opposite are going to make Australia a more expensive tourist destination. They are going to put up the price of tourism in Australia compared with destinations overseas. By proposing this policy, they are throwing away a relative price advantage that the Australian tourism industry has. They are going to throw it away by bringing in a GST. Senator Knowles says, `We will get rid of payroll tax', but the reality is that 87 per cent of firms in the tourism industry do not pay payroll tax now. They are small businesses which are exempt from payroll tax by the exemptions operated by the States. We are creating long term jobs by boosting the tourism industry. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

This matter of public importance is of relevance to hundreds of thousands of unemployed Australians because it highlights why the recent Budget should be the last Budget of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and it explains very clearly why it will be his last.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government's bankcard Budget has been widely condemned, not only by the Opposition but in the media, by economists both in Australia and overseas and, more importantly, by many ordinary Australians. It has been condemned rightly for what it is&mdash;nothing more than a bagful of stop-gap solutions for artificially lowering the unemployment levels in order to buy votes for the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A telling report on the Budget reached me this week from ANZ Group Economics. In its overall assessment and summary of the Budget, the report said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Budget should be viewed as a response to the highest level of unemployment in 60 years, an economy that remains sluggish, and a Federal election that has to occur by the middle of 1993.</PARA>
<PARA>That last clause is the most telling remark in that assessment. It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those looking for strong signs of micro-economic reform in the Budget or steps that will bring the public sector back into surplus in the mid-1990s will be disappointed.</PARA>
<PARA>Need I say any more to sustain the terms of the Opposition's matter of public importance this afternoon which is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The failure of the Government's Budget to provide long-term sustainable jobs and the Government's refusal to undertake the significant structural reform necessary to address the economic crisis facing Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ANZ report reflects the mood of people generally that the Labor Government has not learnt from its past mistakes and that it has learnt little from the over-optimistic forecasts it made in its February One Nation statement. Prime Minister Keating and Treasurer Dawkins have attempted a conjuring trick. They have tried to hide the unemployed by putting some 400,000 of them into training courses. What they have not done is provide long term, sustainable jobs for all of these trainees when they emerge at the other end, or at least create the circumstances in which those jobs will be available by the end of those training courses. They are just putting off the inevitable, scraping the dole queues under the carpet while they try to win another election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As my Leader said, we will just end up with the most educated dole queues in the world. Even if the Government can get the unemployment figure down to 10 per cent by next year, that still means there will be some 870,000 people without jobs. Currently, more than 11 per cent of Australians are&mdash;at this very minute&mdash;unable to find work and therefore unable to properly care for and provide for their dependants. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Eleven per cent of Australians are suffering in anguish and great distress because this Government has been telling lies for the past 10 years about what it is going to do for them, but it has done nothing but let them down and let them down badly. I need not repeat here the misleading statements made by the Prime Minister when he was Treasurer, year after year in Budget Speech after Budget Speech, which gave the people of Australia false hope and which were nothing more than what could be politely described as misleading statements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my home State of South Australia the unemployment figures are a lot higher where, thanks to State Labor  mismanagement, we have the highest levels of debt and unemployment in the country, particularly among young people. The indications for future employment growth are nothing short of appalling. The ANZ Bank's most recent survey of job vacancies shows that advertised job vacancies have remained virtually unchanged in the last two months and have actually fallen since April. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The August unemployment rate, due out tomorrow, is forecast to be between 10.8 per cent and 11.5 per cent. The simple fact is that in this country we have over one million people unable to obtain work and, when we add the number of unemployed with those underemployed, we have a figure approaching some 20 per cent of the Australian work force who cannot gain jobs&mdash;20 per cent of the work force of this nation which is now supposed to be out of recession. That is a ludicrous scenario as we bound towards the twenty-first century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what is the response of the Government to this social disaster? Mere diversionary tactics which do not address the heart of the problem. And we heard it again in the debate today from Senator Cook and Senator Maguire trying to create the perception of false differences between the Government and the Opposition as regards tariff policies, and I will deal with that in detail in a few moments. But the Government refuses to recognise that young people are the future of this country and they are being destroyed by this Government's foolish and thoughtless policies. They are the cruel victims of a pea and thimble trick. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 11 per cent, of course, is a national average and, as I indicated, the problem in South Australia is much more severe than that, and will not be helped by the State Budget handed by Premier Bannon before he resigned, which simply increases the debt burden for South Australians to more than $5,000 a year for every individual living in the State&mdash;hardly an incentive for the creation of jobs by the business sector in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Keating Government intends to spend some $1.2 billion on employment schemes over the next two years&mdash;employment schemes that are essentially creating jobs out of thin air, paid with money the Government simply does not have and can only borrow. Of course, as a result of that we find a Budget deficit projected to be some $13.4 billion, which will no doubt blow out to be much greater than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, the interest on our debt will be increased by $2.6 billion over the next two years. Labor cannot seem to grasp the simple fact that it is the private sector, not the Government, that creates the real wealth and the jobs in this country, which in turn provide the taxes and revenue for the Government to use to administer essential services. Nor is it willing to undertake the desperately needed significant structural reform to our economy to create the circumstances in which the private sector can create that wealth and long term sustainable jobs&mdash;the concern of this matter of public importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead, as I said, we get irrelevant diversions&mdash;republicanism, the flag and, most recently, a fabricated difference between the Government and the Opposition about tariffs on motor vehicles, which has been the only issue raised in the debate this afternoon in response to our MPI by both Minister Cook and Senator Maguire. This attempt to create this perception of difference, above all, demonstrates the utter hypocrisy of the Prime Minister, Mr Keating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this Government came to office, motor vehicle tariffs stood at 57 1/2 per cent. In addition, there was a local content requirement and an effective tariff of 93 per cent as a result of quotas. That certainly equates to a tariff rate of at least 100 per cent if not more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By 1998 tariffs under this Government's policy will be down to 15 per cent from that more than 100 per cent. That represents an 85 per cent or more reduction over a period of 15 years&mdash;5 2/3 per cent a year. Under the Liberal and National parties, by the year 2000 tariffs are intended to be 5 per cent on the motor vehicle industry. That represents a reduction of some 95 per cent over 17 years, which is just under 5 2/3per cent per year&mdash;exactly the same as the rate of reduction by the present Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final difference in tariff rates of 10 per cent is absolutely negligible under a floating exchange rate, which this Government introduced some years ago, because the effect of the floating exchange rate from time to time could well more than offset that 10 per cent, and it has during the life of this Government when tariff reductions have occurred periodically with regard to the motor vehicle industry. We have seen the effect of those tariff reductions on the effective protection rate of the motor vehicle industry more than wiped out by the fall in the value of the Australian dollar. So that difference of 10 per cent is absolutely negligible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, more than that, under Labor, car manufacturers will not get the benefit of the substantial reductions in the cost of production, which it is widely recognised and accepted will be provided by the coalition's Fightback package. This includes the abolition of seven taxes, the most notable of which are the wholesale sales tax, payroll tax and the fuel excise. The abolition of those seven taxes represents lifting a burden of some $20 billion of tax off the backs of business. In addition, there will be a $10 billion saving in government spending. Why will this Government not negotiate with the State governments for the removal of payroll tax, which is a direct disincentive to employment?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also of great importance is the fact that under Fightback we will ensure that the long overdue reforms to Australia's industrial relations system take place. This will ensure greatly improved productivity. It will also allow us, for example, to get things like the on-costs of employment down from their current level, which is in excess of 50 per cent, nearer to the New Zealand level of 17 per cent and thereby provide greater incentives for employment; but, most importantly, reduce the costs of production for industry generally and, most importantly in the context of the issue that we are discussing, the costs of production for the motor vehicle industry, which will much more than offset the minor differences in rates of tariff to apply between the Government and this Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the Government is unwilling to take any of these initiatives which are so desperately needed to reform our economy and provide the basis for long term sustainable jobs. Instead, the Government chooses to demonstrate its hypocrisy on tariffs, as I have just indicated. More than just this attempt to create the perception of difference on tariffs, let us have a look at what the Prime Minister said only a couple of years ago on this very tariff issue when he was the Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Remember in May 1990 when he accused the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, of dragging the chain on tariff reform? According to the then Treasurer Keating, Senator Button was dragging the chain. He accused Senator Button of wanting to do private deals with the car companies and other clients of the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce about future levels of protection. More specifically, on 14 May, Mr Keating said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Button is on record as saying that tariffs should be cut. I applaud him for that. But he does not want to cut them as much as I do. He did not want to cut them as much as I wanted them cut, and had them cut, in 1987.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the then Treasurer, the now Prime Minister, who is trying to create this false perception about the difference between the Government and the Opposition over tariff cuts then condemning his own ministerial colleague for dragging the chain on tariff cuts. What utter cant and hypocrisy!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also heard Senator Button in the last couple of days in relation to this issue raise the matter of export facilitation and how important this is to the Australian car industry, its retention of jobs and its continued survival in Australia. The bottom line with regard to export facilitation is that the Australian car buyer, the Australian consumer, is providing a subsidy for overseas car buyers to buy Australian cars and Australian motor vehicle parts. That is the bottom line as a result of the tariff mechanism and the export facilitation program that relates to it. The effect of that is that cars can be sold cheaper overseas because Australian car buyers pay a higher price than they otherwise would have to. Thereby, Australian consumers, who can ill-afford to do so in the present recession, are subsidising overseas car buyers who are probably in better economic circumstances than are many Australians to buy those vehicles. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people have raised with me the question of why a Ford Capri can be sold cheaper in the United States than in Australia. It is directly as a result of that export facilitation under the tariff mechanism that ensures that Australian car buyers subsidise overseas car buyers. How ridiculous is that, that we are paying the penalty for selling cars overseas! It stands to reason that, if the industry needs a high tariff to survive in Australia but can still be sold overseas, there is that strong subsidy element. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1987, it was estimated that for every motor vehicle sold overseas under export facilitation, the Australian consumer was subsidising to the extent of $10,000 per vehicle or, in total, as was then expected with 40,000 units to be exported, a total of $400m. That means that $400m of Australia's wealth is being exported overseas&mdash;given to overseas residents rather than Australians. So it is a nonsense for the Government to postulate this strong difference between the two parties on tariff protection. </PARA>

It will not happen overnight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the countries where major restructuring changes have been forced on an economy by the government of the day have proved to be dismal failures. Look at the Thatcher experiment. It is true that she did, in fact, offer a genuine alternative to the British people. She went out of her way to restructure British society and she left in her wake large pools of unemployed and an economically and politically disenfranchised northern sector of Great Britain&mdash;certainly the Scottish area. In fact, inflation was at a higher rate than ours and there were extreme difficulties with the British economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">America is the same. George Bush is close to being defeated as President of the United States, not because of his foreign policy or the fact that he himself appears to be an unacceptable individual to the American public, but because the American public is saying loudly and clearly at the moment that the great experiment of the Reagan years, Reaganomics, and Bushenomics&mdash;if I can call it that; or perhaps it is more beating around the bush&mdash;has failed. Unlike Senator Chapman, the Americans are saying, `Okay, we may get relatively cheap cars from abroad'. It is not just the Capri which is being sold there more cheaply; one can buy a 164 Alfa Romeo in America for about $32,000 and in Australia the same car costs about $60,000&mdash;and I am talking in Australian dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All cars are cheaper in America, but the problem in America is that the consequence of that type of `consumer first' approach has been the creation of a wasteland in Detroit and in all the car manufacturing areas of the United States. There has been complete and utter destruction of the American car industry, one of the great linchpins of the American economy. What has happened is that the consumer may have benefited slightly in the US, but the workers in those northern industrial states have not benefited at all. I believe that the rise in crime rate in the US and the absolute factionalising of the politics there is a direct result of some of the policies practised by Bush and Reagan over the last 10 years. </PARA>

If a country's base industries are destroyed, then it has nothing to go on because very few countries can be service trading nations on their own account. All economies must be a mixture which involves having an industrial base, a service base and other bases attached to it. This complexity enables a country to survive changes in world markets. That is the nature of world trade; it is not putting all your eggs in one basket. </PARA>

It is a very unusual mixture.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that it is about time that politicians started running the agenda instead of being run by these economic theorists, who could be instantly categorised as being between 35 to 45 years of age, primarily from the finance sector and educated in classic economic theory, but with no idea of how the real world works. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite quite rightly ask what is happening to small business in this country under the rule or the regime of these dry economist rationalists who have prevailed on both sides of politics. I will tell them what has happened. Small business has not got off the ground because small business relies upon government support; it relies upon government cutting out those stupid bureaucratic procedures which stand in the way of organising a small business; and upon government actually going into the small business area and saying, `How do we form clusters of small businesses attached to big businesses, so that all of them grow together?' Each can give its own expertise to the other. The big businesses can give marketing and prestige to the small ones who may have the ideas. That is the way to build up small industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not heard Professor Dr John Hewson talk about that. I have not heard the dry economic bureaucrats talk about that approach. It is happening in some areas under Senator Button. He is one of the few around this place who has actually sat down and looked at what makes industry grow and survive. Obviously, Senator Button has said to himself and  his bureaucrats, and in discussions with people who count in this area, `The Australian car industry is in great difficulty. How do we make it survive and make it internationally competitive?' That is a reasonable question to ask. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal Party has come in here with simplistic solutions, often at odds with its National Party counterpart, and said that all we need to do is drop tariffs almost to zero, deregulate the labour market, bring in lower wages for young people, maintain the British flag in the left-hand corner of the Australian flag, destroy the unions&mdash;that is really its agenda&mdash;and throw the balance of power and influence in the community towards business people rather than unions. That is its simplistic view about how to get the Australian economy going again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that is not the way to do it. As I said, the way to do it is to start rebuilding the base: get big industry working with small industry; get people thinking internationally; and ensure that the current protections on Australian industry are not destroyed in the vain hope that market hopes will generate new jobs and new industries elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened to the 30,000 or so people who have gone out of the textile, clothing and footwear industry in this country? I bet that they are not sitting in new jobs around the place. Under the Dr Hewson policy, those people would be thrown on the scrap heap permanently. There would be pockets of unemployment and degraded industry all around this country. Some areas, such as the financial centres, would do well. Sydney people would probably do fairly well, except for the small manufacturers or businessmen in the western suburbs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Hewson's view is the view basically of a financier. He is not a farmer, a small businessman or someone who is selling a service to the community that will grow and employ people. Dr Hewson is a man who has lived fairly well over the years from the finance sector. The finance sector is but one part of a total complex of an economy. He has come out of one section and brought his prejudices and academic, classic economic theories to the Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Hewson has not always held these views. If these were the views of Dr Hewson and they had been systematically worked through over the years, I could understand. But Gerard Henderson was perfectly correct to say in his article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> yesterday that Dr Hewson has not always held these theories. Just listen to this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In February 1985 in his column in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> Hewson came out in support of the ALP-ACTU Accord maintaining that "the economic Achilles heel of the Fraser Government was its failure to develop a viable and relevant income and wages policy of that [i.e. Accord] sort". In May 1986 he advised Howard that his (modest) industrial relations policy was "too confrontationist" and "could therefore be counter-productive" and suggested that the Liberal Party should not "pin all of its hopes on labour market deregulation".</PARA>
<PARA>That is the Dr Hewson of 1985. His is a considered opinion in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> when writing for the type of businessman that he is now abusing quite roundly today. That is his view there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Hewson was right then because the accord is the greatest achievement of this Government. It has been, and probably still is, its greatest achievement and will be in the future. What is more, we have gone through difficult times and not caused the social dislocation that is now occurring in the United Kingdom and the USA. I return to the article. According to Gerard Henderson:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These days Hewson is unshakeable in his belief that a 15 per cent GST is an essential part of the Fightback! package which alone can restore the Australian economy. Yet, even here, it was not always so&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>in Dr Hewson's mind. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In April 1990 Hewson criticised those whom he maintained believed that "a consumption tax is the saviour of the Western world". Interviewed by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald's</EMPHASIS> Mike Steketee he also queried whether a GST would have any significant effect on savings.</PARA>
<PARA>That is Dr Hewson in his more reflective moments, before the smell of power got into his nostrils, before the fear of other people criticising him became a very important part of his psyche and before he decided that he needed to attack the people who produce the jobs in this community&mdash;the car industry, the BHPs and the people who underpin our industrial situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Hewson is touchy about these people when they criticise him and say, `You cannot destroy an industry and hope that things will just automatically improve. Fightback will not save the Australian car industry; it is destroying a major industry which has increased its exports three times since 1984'. When they criticise him for attacking them and causing them problems, what is his response? He says, `You are just dinosaurs'. He gets very personally aggressive towards those people who in good faith had hoped for better things from a Liberal government.

<PARA>The document before the Senate is the preliminary advice of the HEC on planning for the 1993-95 triennium, in which we find that the National Board of Employment, Education and Training and its Higher Education Council is offering advice that we believe has a great deal of merit. The HEC and NBEET are trying to tell the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley)</PARA>
<PARA>what the Opposition has been trying to tell the Government for quite some time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The HEC makes several observations and basically comes up with the not too astounding fact that the rapid increase in demand for higher education services over the next three years will place a great deal of strain on the higher education system unless extra money is obtained. It then goes on to advise that the solution is more money for the sector and that this money has to be provided by the Government or by the higher education institutions being given the freedom to raise extra funds themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is precisely what the Opposition has been trying to get the Government to see. It is the exact philosophy of the Opposition's Fightback package. The advice notes that retention rates for 1991 students in year 12 have increased nationally to 71 per cent from 64 per cent last year. The extent of this growth was not predicted and therefore has not been taken into consideration in calculating the current triennium funding. If the transfer rate from year 12 to higher education is to remain stable&mdash;currently at 42 per cent&mdash;additional growth will be needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of applications, the data from State admissions centres reveals that unmet demand is at the highest levels ever. Fifty thousand eligible students are now unable to find a place in higher education. The advice continues by saying that it is possible to argue that some of these students may be better matched with courses in TAFE. But it is very doubtful that TAFE could absorb these numbers, especially given that the TAFE area reports significant unmet demand of its own&mdash;that is, 150,000 students wanting to get into a TAFE course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also points out that opportunity for access by the mature age groups has suffered as demand for places by school leavers has risen. Several States have reported that demand for places by mature age students was higher than for year 12 places in 1992. New South Wales, South Australia, Western Australia and Queensland have all had approximately a third more additional mature age applications than year 12 applications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Meanwhile the number of mature aged entrants nationally has dropped from 55.7 per cent of undergraduates commencing to 47.3 per cent over the last seven years. Now that the Higher Education Council has established what we already knew about the lack of places in higher education and the increasing demand for such places, it goes on to make the profound observation that the solution is increased funding. It then gives these two options:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Council therefore sees only two main options available for increasing the funds allocated to higher education:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">more Commonwealth funds to permit the growth; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">enabling the higher education system to generate some of its own <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">funding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Council plans to establish a working party in 1992 to look at options for financing growth in higher education.</PARA>
<PARA>On the second option the HEC notes that, although it is government policy to exclude fees for undergraduate studies, it is questionable whether it should extend to everybody at every level of award and under all circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>It is pleasing to note that a body set up by this Government has finally become familiar enough with the higher education sector finally to agree with what the Opposition has been trying to tell the Government. The education policy of Fightback addresses the urgent demands of the crisis in our higher education institutions. We will give back to the universities the right to accept Australian fee paying students.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>I wish to address one aspect of the Automotive Industry Authority annual report. The automotive industry has been the subject of much heated debate and discussion. Most of this debate surrounds the fairly simplistic attitude which the Opposition has adopted towards the car industry by promising zero tariff cuts if it were elected to government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr McLachlan's attack on the car industry betrays ignorance, I submit, of the real world. Zero tariff cuts, it is now well and truly on record, would kill off the Australian car industry. In turn, this would have serious repercussions throughout the Australian manufacturing industry because the car industry is a major user of products manufactured by other industries. Figures show that, apart from automotive equipment makers employing 30,000 workers and its own work force in the assembly plants of 26,000, the car industry takes a substantial slice of the output produced by industries employing a further 80,000 workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I give some examples: non-ferrous diecasting 40 per cent; fasteners 23 per cent; plastic mouldings 10 per cent; tool and die 67 per cent; machine tools 60 per cent; ferrous foundries 12 per cent; glass 8 per cent; industrial paint 10 per cent; and steel 8 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Opposition is not the only party guilty of a tariff cutting frenzy. The Government's current aim under the car industry plan is to reduce tariffs on passenger motor vehicles to 15 per cent by the year 2000. This annual report states that to survive under such a tariff regime by the year 2000 will require `further significant changes' to be made because the automotive industry's productivity `remains low by world standards'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the report does not go on to detail just how this additional productivity margin could be achieved. It is fairly clear that one of the reasons may be low production runs, but there may be others. There may be standards of safety, environmental protection and corporate behaviour which we in Australia enforce which our competitors in other countries disregard. I think we need to be quite clear that we have a choice. Certainly, the Opposition appears to be prepared to disregard such standards, to let our standards drop to a world low. Alternatively, we must be prepared to consider employing whatever measures are needed to maintain not only our living standards but the standards of our industries. We must consider that our industries are handicapped by distance, by the size of our market&mdash;</PARA>

It is an independent parliamentary inquiry which, I might add, was opposed by both other parties, which did not even want to know the facts. Yet at this inquiry the evidence shows that there are two major trends. The first is that tariff cuts are producing a substantial increase in imports and, as a result, factory closures and loss of jobs. The second is that the promised savings of micro-economic reform are lagging far behind tariff cuts. What we need is a pause in tariff cuts to develop a more interventionist economic strategy. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

The report outlines briefly the role of the Authority and the work that it has been doing in the last 12 months. I do not want to go into full detail on the report, other than to draw particular attention to what I think is one of the most important statements in the report, on page 4 under the heading, `Performance Indicators', where the Authority talks about the progress that has been made within the industry towards achieving greater international competitiveness in the motor vehicle industry, and pointing out the good things that have been done. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While these are substantial achievements for the industry and a positive reflection of the Government's policy, they are not a cause for complacency. The industry's productivity remains low by world standards and further . . . changes will be necessary if the industry is to survive at a tariff level of 15 per cent by 2000.</PARA>
<PARA>It is in relation to that point, the productivity of the industry, that the coalition has been addressing its attention and all its activities in the preparation and future implementation of the Fightback proposals, which are designed specifically to help industries like the car industry to achieve the objectives that we all want for that industry. Those objectives are to have a vibrant, growing car industry in Australia as part of a vibrant, growing manufacturing sector. There is no dispute about that at all.

That is not true. The coalition's policy is for negligible tariffs in the year 2000, which we have stated categorically is 5 per cent. What we are saying&mdash;this is where we differ from the Government&mdash;is that to get tariffs down we have to take costs off the back of business, off the back of manufacturers. We have to allow them to grow and be more efficient and more productive. That is why all of the coalition's policy proposals for industry, including in particular for the motor vehicle industry, are to get those costs down. That is why we will abolish wholesale sales tax. That is why we will abolish payroll tax. That is why we will abolish fuel excise tax, and the training guarantee levy, and freeze the superannuation levy. All of those things will get the costs of producing goods and services down massively.</PARA></TALK.START>

About 10 years ago, the exchange rate was such that one Australian dollar bought $US1.49 and 440 yen. From that time to the present, the dollar has decreased in value to buy US72c, which is equivalent to a 100 per cent tariff, and will now buy 88 yen, equivalent to something like a 300 per cent tariff. The question has been asked: `Why aren't we booming?'. That is not the solution.

In fact, it is probably the centrepiece of the plan, because we must have a situation where the employees of every organisation take the view that their success depends on the success of the company for which they work or that they will fail if the company for which they work fails.

Not one would indicate a deterioration since 1989, when this paper was actually written. The fact is that fundamental improvements in the political cohesion of our region are under way. It is astounding, therefore, that the tables in this document which show the evolution of our military forces from 1983 to the mid to late 1990s indicate no fundamental change in posture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is lacking in this assessment, and in the policies of the Government and the Opposition in general, is any serious acknowledgment that Australia faces a variety of security threats, none of which are simplistically military in nature. Our conflict with the United States over export subsidies is a case in point. Our unemployment crisis is another. Land degradation and the greenhouse effect are further examples of serious security challenges for which military solutions do not exist and are totally irrelevant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely it is time that we started to ask ourselves whether pumping $10 billion each year into military operations and construction programs is a rational allocation of our limited security resources. There are real threats which have yet to be effectively addressed, yet we are pouring vast sums into solutions to a problem which does not exist. The Australian public has for years been conned into believing that we are vulnerable and defenceless. In recent years the scales have begun to fall from their collective eyes. Sooner or later the voting public will demand a peace dividend or, more accurately, a security dividend. This document suggests that the Government and the Defence Department will be caught flat-footed, but the Australian Democrats will continue to push for a reduction of at least 10 per cent in the Defence budget of this nation and for the application of these funds to address our real needs and our real threats to security. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill is a machinery financing measure to enable certain defence expenditures to be met from the Loan Fund rather than from the Consolidated Revenue Fund and to supplement the moneys available to the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Successive Governments have adopted the practice of introducing a Loan Bill to authorise the issue of moneys from the Loan Fund to meet expenditures that have been appropriated by the Parliament, but for which insufficient funds are available in the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Legally, expenditure from the Consolidated Revenue Fund cannot exceed the moneys available to that Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this Bill is to make provision for the financing of the prospective 1992-93 Budget deficit. The Budget deficit in prospect for 1992-93 gives rise to a deficit in the Consolidated Revenue Fund some $6 billion greater than the Budget deficit. This situation arises because appropriations from the Fund include various items that are classified as financing transactions rather than Budget outlays, and thus do not affect the Budget outcome. These items include payments to the National Debt Sinking Fund and superannuation payments made by the Commonwealth on behalf of public trading enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill provides authority for the loan fund to meet defence expenditures incurred after the passage of the Bill that otherwise would have been met from the Consolidated Revenue Fund, and to supplement the Consolidated Revenue Fund so that it can meet its other commitments. The Bill also provides the borrowing authority to cover these payments from the Loan Fund. The Bill does not authorise expenditures additional to those already appropriated, or currently before the Parliament, apart from loan raising expenses, which will be small.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SWIMMING POOLS TAX REFUND BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this Bill deals with one of the measures relating to sales tax on swimming pools announced by the Treasurer in his Budget speech.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will ensure that refunds of amounts paid as sales tax on swimming pools constructed in situ since 1986 are passed through to pool purchasers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In February of this year the High Court of Australia found amendments made by the Parliament in 1986 in relation to these pools to be of no effect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Court ruled that the amendments do not conform with a requirement in section 55 of the Constitution that laws imposing duties of excise deal with duties of excise only.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the amendments was to overcome an anomaly in the sales tax law that some pools were subject to tax while others were exempt.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An unfortunate effect of the decision, however, is that pool builders, who were able to pass on to purchasers any amounts payable to the Commissioner of Taxation as sales tax on in situ swimming pools, may have been able to get the benefit of refunds payable by the Commonwealth as windfall gains.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will ensure, in line with the refund code in the sales tax law, that there are no windfall gains and any refunds paid by the Commonwealth as a result of the Court's decision go to the person who actually bore the `tax'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effect of this Bill is not to deny the Commonwealth's liability to refund amounts paid as sales tax on in situ swimming pools, but rather to place a condition on the eligibility of a pool builder to a refund by requiring that, if the amount paid as sales tax was passed on to the purchaser, the refund must also be passed on.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Importantly, Mr President, the Bill will also provide for the payment of interest to pool builders as compensation for any period that they are out of pocket as a result of the decision and these amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed changes are not expected to have any direct impact on revenue because an estimate of the refunds has already been included in the base line estimates.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to the suspension of the sitting for lunch I was talking about these sales tax Bills and the way in which this Government had cobbled together this legislation over two years to try to make some sense out of the wholesale sales tax scheme, yet had not bothered to consult the major people within industry who are affected by such extensions of wholesale sales tax. I want to go on and say that all the accumulated rulings that have gathered upon the existing sales tax laws simply become obsolete and a new range of uncertainties result, which is causing great concern to businesses at a time when they are trying to keep their heads above water and retain the jobs that presently exist.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the very nature of sales tax, whether it is multiple rates or multiple exemptions, that recourse must continually be had to administrative and legal intervention. If this Government had any courage at all it would abolish the wholesale sales tax system and put in place a very simple system that cannot be evaded and that will be fairer right across the board. Mr Fernstone has now expressed the concern that private rulings obtained under the new legislation may only apply very specifically to the person addressed, although business practice now dictates that traders rely on rulings concerning identical or similar goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The retail industries also made it clear to the Committee that a manufacturer, under proposed new section 77 of this legislation, could obtain an exempt classification for a product and then have 20 or 30 distributors around Australia required to obtain similar rulings. Once again, why on earth will this Government not take the simple action of abolishing this iniquitous tax&mdash;this highly complicated, unfair tax system&mdash;and replace it with a fair tax system?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the interesting things about a goods and services tax that has been repeated time and time again by those who live under it&mdash;and as recently as about a month ago in New Zealand by people from the trade union movement, the teaching profession, the aged, large industries, small industries, small business and retailing&mdash;is that a goods and services tax is a fair tax because it cannot be avoided.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can always rely on Senator West to put in a loopy comment right on cue.

This Labor Government always forgets that we are dealing not with discretionary rules but with laws that this Parliament has a deep responsibility to consider as they stand, not simply as how we may be told they will be interpreted.

Unfortunately, Government senators such as Senator West are not bright enough to be able to comprehend all of that. I confess that it is complex. But I just wish that people would stop going round misrepresenting the position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government is extending its tentacles further and further into the goods and services area. As I mentioned prior to the suspension of the sitting for lunch, it is absurd for this Labor Government to suggest that it does not have a services tax at the moment. It is absurd for it to attack the concept of a goods and services tax because it is actually placing a tax on services through its own legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The very legislation that we are debating today seeks to tax a service. It singles out a particular innovative service that is essential to competitive manufacturing. This Government is seeking to apply a 20 per cent tax to external design work in the development of a product. That is what I was talking about prior to lunch. We are talking about a service. Business will have to pass on this non-refundable tax to the consumer. All of this will add to the cost of the product. This Government has slammed on another tax. It has extended this tax to the service area. The big difference between this extension of sales tax and a goods and services tax is that the Opposition proposes not only that the goods and services tax be applied evenly but also that it be applied fairly and that business be able to claim back every cent so that this cost does not have to be passed on to customers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation also deals with other taxes. Senator Button said prior to lunch that there is no tax on food. The Government is crying crocodile tears over the little piece of legislation that is now before us&mdash;legislation which proposes an increase in the tax on containers for take away food. If that is not part of a tax on food, what is? This tax is to be built into the cost of buying food. Unfortunately, low income people generally consume more take away food. That is another area of concern that should be addressed at another time in another debate. We need to examine why low income people are consuming more take away food. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government proposes in this legislation to extend sales tax to take away food. It proposes to increase the tax on food containers from 10 to 20 per cent. This means that an extra $61m will be taken from the taxpayers. That $61m increase in tax will be paid by guess who? It will be paid by the consumer. So it is hypocritical of anybody to suggest that there is no tax on food at present. We know that in many cases food itself is taxed. However, food containers as well as transport, manufacture and production are taxed. Under the Fightback package none of them will be taxed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is about time that this Government understood that it is exacerbating a problem.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give some further classic examples. Sensors and thermostats for electrical appliance will lose their exempt status and are going to be taxed at 20 per cent. Plastic and rubber sheeting will lose their exemption. Hot water tanks are going to be taxed for the first time and are to lose their exemption. This Government, which cries crocodile tears, is extending and extending taxes. How dare the Government do that when it knows and understands that all of this will cost the consumers more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Bishop said earlier this morning, there will not be just a 20 per cent increase in wholesale sales tax because the 20 per cent is put on before the product is marked up for resale. So the real increase could end up being about 28 per cent. Of course, a number of people would not understand that because they have never been in business. They have never been in the wholesale business; they have never been in the retail business. Therefore, one can understand why they do not understand these things. Nonetheless, these people will go around and spread untruths. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very glad to have the opportunity to speak in this debate on the Government's proposed simplification of sales tax. I have an opportunity to do what I promised to do when I first came into this chamber, and that is to bring to the attention of the Senate some of the concerns that people have about sales tax in general.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed simplification is not really a simplification at all. If a caring government had bothered to consult with the people and the businesses concerned, as it promised to do, it would know that there is nothing simple about sales tax Bills. Of course, there is only one way really to simplify sales tax legislation and that is to get rid of wholesale sales tax completely. If that had happened, we would have been able to avoid some of the confusion and anger which the introduction of this sales tax legislation has caused, particularly in a lot of areas of rural South Australia where people were not aware of the ramifications. This Government promised that it would consult with business and individuals before making any changes to the legislation. What a hollow promise that turned out to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My special concern has always been the effect that this tax would have on rural areas and, in this instance, the farm machinery dealers in rural Australia. I can state categorically that they were not consulted about any of the changes that they believed might affect them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Government had succeeded in rushing the sales tax Bills through before the winter break, I and many others would not have had time to consider any of the implications of the proposed changes. But thank goodness we did have time. My office has been inundated with telephone calls, letters and faxes from concerned and confused farm machinery dealers in rural and regional South Australia. These dealers are not tax experts; they never have been. All they know is that they were selling agricultural machinery and spare parts to primary producers who were tax exempt. For all of this time they have been exempt from paying tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dealers have been exempt from paying tax on items that they buy. As Senator Short has already pointed out, the machinery they stock is sometimes worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. If dealers had been forced to pay sales tax and then wait until the stock had been sold before claiming a refund, this would have spelt the end for many businesses. In fact, if dealers had had to pay sales tax all along, I am sure that many of them would never have opened their doors. Along with many other businesses, dealers cannot afford to have stock which sometimes sits around for an enormous length of time waiting to be sold to tax exempt producers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Why should these dealers lose out, not only in terms of interest but also in terms of stock that they cannot afford to buy? After all, tens of thousands of dollars in sales tax on a single piece of machinery could translate into a very significant purchase of things such as spare parts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable senators would be well aware, because machinery dealers had not been consulted and informed of the changes to the sales tax laws, when they first heard of them they believed that they would have to pay an up-front sales tax of 20 per cent on their current stock, both large machinery and spare parts. I now understand from the Tax Office representatives that they did not believe machinery would have been affected&mdash;it was only spare parts under threat of a 20 per cent sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, the Australian Tax Office, under pressure from the Federal coalition, the Tractor and Machinery Association of Australia and the Farm Machinery Dealers Association, subsequently gave an assurance that dealers would not have to pay sales tax. However, it should be noted that under the proposed `simplification' of the legislation, all the current arrangements with the Commissioner of Taxation for tax exempt status will cease to exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of this, according to Arthur Anderson's submission to the Senate Select Committee on Sales Tax Legislation, taxpayers will have to reapply for rulings and:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . entrust that the Commissioner of Taxation will provide a satisfactory response within sufficient time for the taxpayer to be able to proceed under the new legislation with the commercial certainty which is important in its business operations.</PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, under section 84 it would be at the discretion of the Commissioner of Taxation to decide whether or not a farm machinery dealer or dealers could be tax exempt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is quite obviously an unsatisfactory arrangement. When farm machinery dealers sell agricultural machinery exclusively for use by tax exempt primary producers, why does the Tax Commissioner need to make a ruling? Surely there is nothing more certain than that in most cases agricultural machinery dealers will be selling to exempt primary producers&mdash;they buy almost all of the harvesters and combine harvesters and other agricultural machinery that is handled by these dealers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, as I have stated, even this was not understood by the dealers' associations. There had been no consultation and no information was given to them, so they did not know where they stood under this new legislation. They were under the impression that the legislation would be amended so that dealers would have to pay sales tax of 20 per cent when buying machinery and spare parts, and then wait until the items were sold before claiming a refund from the Tax Office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Confusion about the proposed changes has been the order of the day. Considering that many farm machinery dealers in South Australia, including in my area, hold stock worth up to a million dollars, it is not surprising that they reacted badly to this news. Like Australian farmers, many dealers are asset rich but money poor. If they had to pay that 20 per cent sales tax on current stock, according to figures from the Tractor Machinery Association of Australia, it is predicted that the average dealer would be looking at an up-front payment of $60,000 and the larger dealers an up-front payment of $200,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think it is any secret that in the current climate, particularly in most of our rural areas, farm machinery dealers, who in many cases have been the hardest hit of all businesses in those rural communities, cannot afford to pay one extra dollar in tax, let alone tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it was decided that some or all dealers were not tax exempt, selling stock, particularly small spare parts, would have become an administrative nightmare. Sales tax would have been payable on every individual nut and bolt sold by any one of these dealers. The dealers also would have had to bear the cost of increased paperwork, which would have to have been regarded as more than just a nuisance because dealers simply could not afford to put on the extra staff that would be required to process the necessary paperwork. Then, of course, there is always the possibility that some dealers and some businesses would refuse to sell small items at great inconvenience to those whom they service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given all this, if this sales tax burden were to be borne by Australian farm machinery dealers, the potential risk would be the closure of many dealerships, even if the sales tax applied only to spare parts. With the closure of many dealerships, farmers would be forced to travel further than they already do&mdash;and they already travel enormous distances because of the effect of the recession in rural areas&mdash;maybe just to get a small item for the equipment that they are using. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators might say that I am overreacting, but in the mid-1980s there were 2,500 dealerships across Australia; in 1992 there are only 800, and a staggering 16,000 jobs have been lost in the rural industry through dealerships and machinery agencies throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give my fellow senators an idea of the hardship that would have been caused had the dealers, who in some cases would not have been exempt, been forced to pay this 20 per cent sales tax on current stock and parts. These details have become known to me because, as I mentioned before, I was inundated by phone calls, letters and faxes from farm machinery dealers throughout South Australia&mdash;and I know that most other senators' offices have been inundated in the same way. It is a mistake to underestimate the importance of this issue to machinery dealers. Their very livelihoods are at stake and they have not hesitated to let us know about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The managing director of a farm machinery dealership in a small town in South Australia told me that the proposed changes would be a major impost on all rural Australia. In the case of his dealership and those of many other dealers like him, it `may well be the last straw'. He also told me that, as he understood the proposed changes at that time, dealers would have been forced to pass on to their farmers some of the cost of the 20 per cent sales tax. This, in turn, would cause producers to reconsider buying new machinery&mdash;and farmers have been finding it difficult enough to afford new machinery as it is without an increase in prices. They may have looked to repairing older machinery with spare parts to keep things running for longer than they would have normally&mdash;but of course this dealer was concerned that those prices might have risen too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was also concerned that the proposed changes would have resulted in less stock being held by businesses and dealers. As I have pointed out in my communications on this issue, farmers would then have to wait while the machinery or spare parts they wanted were ordered in. Honourable senators can just imagine the concern that this would cause at a time when many producers in rural Australia would be reaping and harvesting perishable items. Not only that, but emergency orders often attract a 5 per cent surcharge as well as freight charges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is not difficult to see that it would not have been only dealers who suffered if forced to pay a 20 per cent sales tax; those whom they supply, the farmers and primary producers, would also have suffered by waiting longer and paying more for any stock that they might wish to acquire. This gentleman's letter to me concluded by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I manage a family company that has survived since 1905, with no thanks to the present Government. Six years ago I had two premises employing twelve people. Today I have one premise and employ four people, including my wife and myself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Can't these people realise the pain, suffering and heartache that we in rural Australia have already been put through due to this Labor Government. Obviously they don't realise or don't care, seeing how they would think up something as potentially damaging as this legislation. I hope some commonsense will prevail.</PARA>
<PARA>Another farm machinery dealer also wrote to me telling me that the payment of a 20 per cent sales tax would send him and many other dealers broke, and I can cite letters from at least a dozen other small and large machinery firms throughout the whole of rural South Australia. In the past few years, these companies have reduced their staff by somewhere between 20 per cent and 60 per cent. None are in a position where they can afford to have any further imposts on their current business costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Farm Machinery Dealers Association of Australia and the Tractor and Machinery Association of Australia have also been inundated with desperate calls. I am told that every one of the dealers who contacted them said they would have to reduce staff or shut their doors if a 20 per cent sales tax were imposed. When legislation such as this is being brought before this House, when people have been told that they will be consulted, when they have been told that they will be able to have input and express their concerns, we should not forget we are playing with people's lives. It is all very well to get carried away with debating or scoring points or winning votes, but at the end of the day people could be losing businesses and jobs because of the decisions we make. In fairness to all those people who have struggled through difficult times to try to keep these areas going, they should at least have been consulted and have had an opportunity to have some input into this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know of dealers who were worried sick for a couple of months about the effect of any of these changes to the tax legislation. They live in many small country towns where they have no hope of getting a job if their dealership is forced to the wall. They are almost all family companies. So it is not just one job that is lost; it is the jobs of families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Budget, the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) talked about this Labor Government being a caring government which is creating jobs. Surely, the Treasurer must be jesting. Jobs would not need to be created if it was not for the thoughtless decisions&mdash;when legislation such as this was brought in in such haste and passed through the House of Representatives in such haste&mdash;that caused those jobs to be lost in the first place. This legislation was pushed through this Parliament almost without any proper debate, either in the other House or in this place, and, equally worrying, without consulting any of the dealer associations or the dealers themselves. The only way the Government could get away with this was to try to push this legislation through as quickly as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am glad to say that did not happen because dealers have now had the chance to voice their concerns to all members of Parliament, to all of their dealer associations. They have been able to make representations so that people are aware of many of the difficulties they are facing. This legislation would have only meant further difficulties which would have added to the imposts that the dealers already have. I am glad they had the chance to voice their concerns and, with Democrat support, the legislation was sent to a Senate select committee where these concerns were able to be expressed. Because of the pressure applied during those past weeks, the Government has been forced to back down in many significant areas of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Naturally, I was happy to learn of the Government's about face in some areas of this so-called simplification, as detailed in the press release of 11 August 1992 which states that there are six areas of change, including those affecting leases, exempt use and deemed manufacturers. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 12 August 1992 described these changes as an `embarrassing backdown', and I certainly agree with that. However, I am less than happy with the way in which the changes were announced&mdash;on the eve of the Select Committee's public hearings. The disruption caused by this late announcement is unacceptable, particularly to those people who were preparing submissions for the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line, however, is that this legislation should not exist at all and I will be satisfied only when this tax is abolished in its entirety and replaced with a goods and services tax where everybody knows what the sales tax charge is. The goods and services tax will get rid of this hidden consumption tax&mdash;the wholesale sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that we do have to suffer this legislation, the Tractor and Machinery Association of Australia and I are still very concerned about one aspect of the proposed legislation as it relates to farm machinery dealers; that is, that the Commissioner of Taxation still has the discretion to determine whether a machinery dealer can claim sales tax exemption at the time of purchasing his equipment. I understand that it has now been agreed that farm machinery dealers will be granted exempt status in 99 per cent of cases. But I believe that this exemption should be enshrined in legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Tractor and Machinery Association, other farm machinery dealer associations and the dealers themselves are still concerned; and some of them are still confused. The associations are unable to guarantee their members that the Tax Commissioner will give them a tax exempt status. I am sure that, despite the assurances the Tax Commissioner has given, there will still be farm machinery dealers losing sleep over whether their dealership will be one that is not granted a tax exempt status. The dealer associations, like me, do not think this legislation has been simplified at all. The community and business concern over the proposed changes has shown clearly that this Government has misjudged its own abilities to simplify anything, let alone something as complicated as the existing wholesale sales tax arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I stated previously, I look forward to the time when sales tax, along with six other discriminatory and unfair taxes, is abolished in its entirety and replaced by a goods and services tax. There will then be no need for farm machinery dealers or any other businesses to be worried about whether they will be granted a tax exempt status. There will be no need for the Tax Commissioner to make the decisions. The dealers will collect the GST on the items they sell and pay the GST on the items they purchase, but there will be no imposition on them because this will be refunded before it ever has to be paid. They will be secure in the knowledge that all machinery sold to exempt primary producers will be exempt from this tax. There will not be classification disputes and there will be a single rate of tax that will be enshrined in legislation. I can only repeat a statement made by Coopers and Lybrand in its submission to the Select Committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As sales tax is a self-assessing tax, it is imperative that this "new" law, which replaces the existing sales tax legislation, meets all the tests of a good taxing statute, ie simplicity, equity, efficiency and certainty.

It also confused industry witnesses who had prepared evidence for the Committee based on what they had thought were the Bills to hand at the time. To my mind, the Treasurer was in contempt and showed utter disregard and disrespect for the work of the Senate and its committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Taxation Office has supposedly been working on this legislation for two years. What on earth was it doing for that length of time? It did not speak with industry, or it supposedly did not speak with industry. It did not examine the consequences of the Bills and it could not even get the amendments ready, those amendments already announced by the much used press release method, for the Select Committee to discuss. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How will business in this country&mdash;which is under a big threat from the Labor Government not only at the moment but has been for the last eight or nine years&mdash;operate when the rules keep changing? Not only do the goal posts get moved, but also the playing fields get moved. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RD4">Senator BROWNHILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, different grounds and maybe different towns. Superannuation levies were on and then off again, and now sales tax. As I said, business in Australia has been forgotten by this Government. As we have heard, this legislation impacts widely on many sections of the business community. As is the hallmark of this Labor Government, there has been an almost total lack of consultation by the Tax Office. I think that has to be rectified in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a lack of consultation with the businesses and organisations that are most affected. The Government talks about consultation, but it does not really know the meaning of the word. The Treasurer suggests that he has been consulting widely with the community. I already made the point a minute ago that in his press release he said that he consulted widely, but he did not. That is really the problem of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In reality, lots of people wrote to him telling him what a crummy lot of Bills he had drafted. That is what this Government calls consultation. It is saying, `We will listen, but we are terribly sorry, we do not have our hearing aids on and we actually have not got our glasses either. So if you send in a written submission, we cannot even read it'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this Government's intention with these Bills was to simplify the process of sales tax, and the Treasurer tells us that was the case, then clearly he and his Government have failed. It is interesting, when we think of the sales tax system, that at the moment there are something like five rates of sales tax: zero, 10 per cent, 15 per cent, 20 per cent and 30 per cent. It is very difficult for people with any product to know what is happening with sales tax, because they do not know what will be rammed on in the form of sales tax. That is the subject of another Bill that will be debated in this chamber in a little while. That is something that we will fix up in government. We will have a flat 15 per cent goods and services tax which, as Senator Ferguson made very clear, is refunded as a business input for those who are operating with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this legislation is doing is complicating the issue even further. I will quote what would have happened if we had not had the Select Committee. Of course, the Ernst and Young critique of the legislation highlighted the point of sales tax simplification&mdash;and this is in the Bill. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commissioner may determine that particular things are to be treated as not having happened, that particular things are to be treated as having been done by a different person or to have happened at a different time, that particular things that did not actually happen are to be treated as having happened and, where appropriate, to have been done by a particular person or to have happened at a particular time.</PARA>
<PARA>If that is called simplification, God help us. That wording does not simplify the sales tax regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, for a bankrupt government, the fact that this legislation in this so-called simplifying process will raise an additional $91m is a mere incidental part of it. Certainly it is designed to reduce the number of Bills, if not the confusion that these new substituted Bills will create. No matter how the Keating Government fiddles with the books, and no matter how many times it robs Peter to pay Paul, the fact remains that the economic incompetence of the Government lives on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians seeking a better way and a more efficient and effective system will have to be patient&mdash;although the waiting time is getting shorter every day&mdash;for a proper, thorough and responsible overhaul of the economy through the coalition's Fightback package. The quicker we can have an election, the quicker we can allow people to get this type of legislation fixed up and have a decent fight back for all Australians, and the better it will be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, this Government has introduced this legislation not to provide an easier or improved sales tax regime for business&mdash;because I truly believe that there are too many examples to demonstrate the total lack of concern the Labor Government has for anyone in business today&mdash;but as a revenue raiser. The capacity of the Labor Government to raise revenue from the public by stealth is something that every Australian voter ought to remember and be reminded of on a regular basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every time those on the other side of this chamber mention the coalition's GST in a pathetic and desperate way that is designed to scare the electorate, one only has to ask&mdash;and I ask those on the other side of the chamber now&mdash;what about the Government's grab bag from hidden taxes? What about the $9.4 billion that it rips off the unsuspecting taxpayer every year in sales tax on everything from babies' nappies to funeral caskets? Why has that trebled in the last nine years? Why have those opposite, as members of the Labor Party under Mr Keating, first as the Treasurer and now as the Prime Minister, trebled the sales tax take? It is now $9.4 billion that the Government is ripping off everyone in all those different areas of sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the tax on fuel? It is some $7.2 billion this year. What about the slightly less hidden taxes such as Medicare, which is raising some $2.5 billion, and income tax generally? Income tax generally this financial year will give the Government $66 billion. That is $66 billion ripped off the Australian people in personal taxes; $2.5 billion into Medicare, ripped off the Australian people by the Keating Labor Government; $7.2 billion in fuel tax&mdash;which the coalition will abolish&mdash;ripped off the Australian people; and $9.4 billion that this Government is ripping off people now in sales taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the Government rightly deserves the title of the highest taxing government in Australia's history. That is not fiction; that is fact. Here is a government that runs scared every time we say we want a new vision for Australia, we want a Fightback and we want a GST which will be fair for all Australians. Every time this Government, that is ripping all that money off the Australian population now, tries to start a scare campaign. I believe that this Government deserves the title it has earned of the highest taxing government in Australia's history. It has earned it at the expense of struggling families, for which it should stand condemned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Ferguson mentioned earlier, desperate farmers are littered across this country in increasing numbers. Despite the already demonstrated capacity of the Australian Taxation Office to extract more money from the public, these Bills have increased the powers of the Tax Commissioner so that he can treat transactions in whichever way he chooses. If there is no other reason for fearing these Bills, I believe that this reason alone is sufficient to say that they should not pass through this place. Given Senator Bishop's recent questioning of the impartiality of the Tax Office and its Commissioner, anything which gives the Tax Office wider discretionary powers is dangerous in the extreme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having established that the benefits of these Bills accrue almost exclusively to the Government, one must start to ask just how they adversely affect business. I have to look no further than what this legislation would have originally done to the farm machinery dealers which has been well spoken about by speakers here this afternoon and tonight. The farm machinery industry is a classic example of a group that the Tax Office did not bother to even think about. It did not give them a chance to come and put their point of view. Farm machinery is an industry that the Government has not bothered to understand or keep in contact with. Comments by Democrat senators and by Senator Kernot in her letter to everyone in machinery dealerships is absolutely an indictment of her lack of knowledge of what the GST is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's position on these Bills has been very well put by Senator Short and Senator Vanstone in their minority report to the Senate Select Committee. The lack of consultation is demonstrated again and again&mdash;the Institute of Chartered Accountants, the Australian Society of CPAS, the Retailers Council, the Farm Machinery Dealers Association, the Journalists Association, the Photo Marketing Association, ACROD and the list goes on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet the Treasurer tells us that he has consulted widely. I wonder what telephone box he met in, because I do not think that he actually consulted with many people. The minority report expressed the following view:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The hearings revealed that the Government's new proposed Wholesale Sales Tax would include a tax on food, a tax on services, a tax on exports, a tax on tourism, a tax on farmers, a tax on many manufacturers, double taxation, a tax on infrastructure and a tax on plant and buildings. These taxes are all the result of the fundamentally flawed Wholesales Sales Tax system, that this Labor Government seeks to retain.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I have said, the current sales tax system is just not working. It is actually driving people to the economic grave. The quote I have just read highlights a government that is trying to tell the electorate that a one-off, up-front visible GST is unfair and discriminatory. The Government's sales tax which is in place at the moment is the most unfair and most discriminatory of any taxes. It is a tax that does not give incentive in any way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sales tax is a tax on goods. It has a cascading effect which results in a tax on all sorts of goods and services. It is paid and borne by business and is highly uncompetitive. It means that many Australian producers are left at a substantial disadvantage compared with overseas competitors, both in export markets and domestically. On that basis, I have to ask why the Labor Government is continuing to hang on to such an iniquitous tax regime at the expense of Australians and Australian business. If this package of Bills is its best attempt to simplify our tax system and make it more equitable, it ought to give the game away. Clearly, the task of managing Australia and its economy for the benefit of all Australians is definitely beyond the Keating Labor Government. </PARA>

<PARA>I do not think anyone would be applauding Mr Bush right now, having regard to the announcement that he has made. Certainly, he would not be applauded by Australian wheat farmers. I quote from his speech of that day:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This region is the fastest growing market in the world, and still there are voices on both sides of the Pacific calling for economic isolationism. While for some nations, including Australia and the United States, these are tough, hard economic times, we both know that protectionism is a fundamentally bankrupt notion. Make no mistake: America will continue to stand for open trade and open markets. And trade means jobs&mdash;it means good jobs&mdash;at home and abroad.</PARA>
<PARA>Later in his speech he stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We both know, all of us know, that the real answer is what our two governments are doing&mdash;working hard for an historic new GATT arrangement that cuts back subsidies, especially for exports. That is why the United States is committed to working with GATT Director Dunkel's new text.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what President Bush of the United States said on 2 January, a short seven months ago. Last week we had that shock announcement. When I first heard it in the morning, I thought the figure was $4.1 billion. Fortunately, later in the day it was cut back to $1.4 billion&mdash;the two figures were taken back to front. Of course, there was no applause for that announcement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following Bush's visit subsidised wheat sales continued throughout Europe, Asia and wherever the United States could get sales. At the time I gave notice of a motion. In fact, as Senator Evans had been quoted in one of the local newspapers as saying he was annoyed by what was going on, I gave notice of the following motion, which was declared formal and carried the next day:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) welcomes the decision by the European Community (EC) to reform its huge farm subsidy program; </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) notes that the biggest breakthrough is in the area of grain production; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) requests the Government of the United States of America to accept the EC's new position and cut back its own subsidies.</PARA>
<PARA>The reason I gave notice of that motion was because the EC had decided that enough was enough and it was starting to make inroads into what was being done. Rather than subsidise further, it cut back on the acreage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The very next day or so I was visited in my office by two officers from the United States Embassy in Canberra. One was Donald R. Cleveland, First Secretary, Embassy of the United States of America, and the other was L. Stuart Allan, Counsellor for Economic Affairs, Embassy of the United States of America. They gave me a verbal going-over and wanted to know what I was up to. They believed that the United States was doing enough and that Europe should be following it. I told them that the United States was continually carrying out subsidisation, even though President Bush had given us hope that this would not be the case when he addressed both Houses of Parliament, and also when he met the delegation from the National Farmers Federation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They told me that the EC was the villain and they had to get out and fight it. While they were there they told me that exactly the same motion was passed by the Belgian Parliament that day. There was shock and horror that I should have the audacity to put forward such a motion, yet the Belgian Parliament passed the same motion. They also told me that my Party had never heard of the motion, nor had the Labor Party or anyone else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Madam Acting Deputy President, I do not need to explain to you what is done with regard to a formal notice of motion in this place. It is taken to the Whip's office and is okayed by the Government, the Democrats, Senator Harradine&mdash;and I presume he represents the others in that corner&mdash;and the National Party. So everyone knew about it, yet they tried to tell me that that was not so. I told them that I believed that the EC was to blame, but it had made a start and I expected the United States to follow. They went back to their office and I carried on with my own business that day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 22 June, just before the winter recess, the President of the Senate received a letter from Mel Sembler, the Ambassador for the United States. Unfortunately, it was missed because of the rush of business that day. A couple of us wanted to speak on the matter but we were not in the chamber at the time. It will take a few minutes, but I intend to read the letter. Mr Sembler said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Sibraa:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thank you for providing me with the text of the Senate Resolution of 3 June `welcoming the decision of the European Community (EC) to reform its huge farm subsidy program,' and requesting the U.S. Government `to accept the EC's new position and cut back its own subsidies.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was quite surprised with the Resolution since it suggests that the EC has done all it needs to do to reform its Common Agricultural Policy, and to imply that action to reduce European export subsidies and market access barriers is of no concern to the Australian Senate. I wonder if Australian farmers would agree.</PARA>
<PARA>Australian farmers have certainly agreed with everything I have had to say on that matter. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The U.S. began reducing its internal price support levels and mandating acreage set aside four years ago. These U.S. policy reforms are part of the reason that U.S. wheat output has been reduced.</PARA>
<PARA>He could have fooled me! The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are glad that the EC is beginning to catch up with our reforms. It should be emphasized that even with its announced reforms, the EC has yet to address the issues of increased market access and decreased export subsidies, which remain much greater than U.S. subsidies.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no argument about that. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The U.S. and Australia are on record as favouring the compromise proposals on agricultural trade offered by GATT Director General Arthur Dunkel. These proposals call for specific reductions in internal support, increased market access and decreased use of export subsidies.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is the letter that the President received on 22 June. Having read that letter, I will accept that this was starting to happen, but then, all of a sudden, the other day, just when the wheat industry of Australia has some hope of recovery, that shock announcement was made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the announcement there has been dismay from the farmers, of course. The shock waves are still reverberating. Harvesting machinery dealers are losing harvesting orders&mdash;whether they have been cancelled or delayed pending the market outcome. There has been a rush on fixed wheat contracts offered by the Australian Wheat Board. The prices are fixed and the hope is that a reasonably stable price will be received. The United States has sold 600,000 tonnes of wheat to the Egyptian market this week, at prices ranging between $US109 per tonne down to $US103, with the subsidy being $US25 a tonne or, in other words, $A35 per tonne. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will quickly look at the history of the wheat market in Australia over the last three years. In 1989-90, the pool returned to Australian wheat farmers for ASW10 grade wheat was $185 a tonne. The year after, with that big push from American subsidised sales&mdash;or the export enhancement program, I should say&mdash;they received $125 a tonne, which is $60 a tonne less. It just fell away in the last month before harvesting. That was one of the biggest contributing factors to wheat farmers being in the position they are now compared with two years ago.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year, there was an improvement in prices because the Americans had a tougher season, they did not have so much wheat to sell and subsidise, and the Australian wheat price went back to approximately $180 a tonne. This year, we were hoping to reach the same price, and the Wheat Board, where I spoke to somebody today, was expecting much the same figure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fortunately, it is not all doom and gloom just yet. The price has not slipped away yet, but in time it can happen. The subsidisation of the Egyptian sale at $A35 a tonne is only the starter. It will immediately take $A35 off the $A180 a tonne, and that is certainly something Australian wheat farmers cannot handle at present.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Worse still, in the 1990-91 season, there was a lot more wheat in the world but the subsidy was paid in extra grain. This year, the Americans are not going to do that; they are going to pay it in cash. So the effect, when it comes, will be greater. Of course, the cash subsidy will be more apparent and at least it will be on the table. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United States has said that it will target our good markets of India, South Africa, Pakistan and, I suppose, Indonesia. The other day, we heard Pakistan and South Africa say that they will stand by us because they are buyers of the premium wheat&mdash;of our good wheat. Fortunately, the Australian Wheat Board had made a lot of forward sales, but it will not tell me what the figure is because that information is commercially confidential. Those countries do not want the American wheat, but they do want the American prices. Although they will remain true to us, we will be receiving American prices. That will reverberate right through the wheat industry and cause more problems to farmers who, with that bad downturn in prices of two years ago, regained their position last year slightly. It was hoped that they were going to be in front this year, but now all we can do is look forward to much the same situation of two years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us hope that the Australian Government can persuade the Government of the United States to back off from its ill-conceived plan. I know that it is an election year in the United States, but as far as I am concerned the sooner that election is over the better and we can get back to normal thinking. That does not mean that the Government should not be working to do all it can to reverse the decision and help the farmers out of the situation they are in. Australian farmers are not looking for guaranteed minimum prices; they are not looking for subsidy. They are just looking for the Government to do what it should be doing for them so that they will be in a much better position if this situation continues. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The community has gradually been deserted and betrayed by one after another of Government members who could have intervened. The list of people who have changed their minds goes on and on. The about-face by Jim McGinty on the importance of Aboriginal spirituality and heritage is well known. I quote from his speech on his entering Parliament as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . rather than maintaining a preoccupation with the important and powerful people of our society. . . I will endeavour during my term in this Parliament to. . . enhance the welfare of the Aboriginal people of this country. In this context the Old Swan Brewery dispute needs to be reconsidered. In my view it is a social justice issue rather than a simple question of whether one ought to preserve the old building.</PARA>
<PARA>This is from the Heritage Minister who has put out a special edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Government Gazette</EMPHASIS> which excises the Swan Brewery precinct from the operation of any law, town council, metropolitan regional planning scheme and the Aboriginal Heritage Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Likewise, Gerry Hand, when he was Federal Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in 1989, was able to change his mind in the space of a month. On 22 June 1989, Mr Hand wrote to Robert Bropho saying that he had decided to make a permanent declaration over the site after considering the report of Dr Senior. That permanent declaration was revoked only a month later because the then Dowding Government in Western Australia had given an undertaking to abide by the Western Australian  Aboriginal Heritage Act, an Act, by the way, that has just been superseded by a Heritage Act. Mr Hand, in a letter to Isobel Weir said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will be taking a careful interest in the manner in which the site is dealt with under the Aboriginal Heritage Act (WA). The Perth Aboriginal community, of course, may apply to me under the Act in the future, should they consider that the site is endangered.</PARA>
<PARA>In spite of Mr Hand's assurances, all approaches to Mr Robert Tickner, the current Minister, have failed. The Federal Government has refused to intervene to protect the site and is not prepared to put on the public record an explanation for its failure to act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Does the Federal Government lack the political will to act in defiance of the Lawrence Government?  Have Mr Hand's files from his time as Minister not been transferred to Mr Tickner's office, or has Mr Tickner's voice been stifled by his Cabinet? The list of people who have changed their minds or stopped speaking goes on. What happened to the spirited opposition to the redevelopment of the site from Rory O'Connor, who wrote to Robert Bropho in July 1989, saying that the site was regarded as sacred by Dr Egloff, Dr Vinnicombe and Dr Senior? The letter was written specifically to reject claims made to the Western Australian Trades and Labour Council by Premier Dowding, as he then was. And what of Ken Colbung, who went to the Supreme Court in November 1987 to have redevelopment of the site stopped? He walked in the march organised by Mr Campbell. His application then was based on the fact that the site is sacred by virtue of its association with the Waugal and therefore is a site to which the Western Australian Aboriginal Heritage Act applies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it may be uncomfortable for some that their previous positions on the site are exposed for all to see, the record stands clear in newspaper clippings, in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and in letters and papers. This is Dr Carmen Lawrence's Noonkanbah. This is an opportunity for reconciliation which may never be repeated. Some voices have given up and been silenced but others remain strong. I would like to quote from Mr Steve Mickler, talking about the claims of the Nyungah people:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Theirs is also a powerful heritage claim in a city without a single publicly visible, legally denoted Aboriginal space, in a State without any genuine form of Aboriginal land rights and having arguably now the worst manifestations of indigenous impoverishment, incarceration and cultural marginality.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All the more powerful because opinion polls show an overwhelming majority of Western Australians agree with Aboriginal protest leader Robert Bropho's demand that the old brewery be demolished and the site turned into parkland, albeit most for varied and different reasons than his.</PARA>
<PARA>We must remember that the Aboriginal people whom we have decimated, who still survive in the metropolitan area, have a claim in their spirituality to that site. However, they are being subjected to the much more strict claims of Aboriginal people in heritage areas whose culture and social organisation have not been decimated. As I said, fortunately not all voices have been silenced. I am sure that many people took encouragement from the stand made by Galarrwuy Yunupingu, who was quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> paper this morning:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to bring to the attention of the Senate the problems surrounding the development of open learning in Australia. Open learning is a rapidly developing area of our education sector that is exceptionally important to our future. It has many different applications and has the capacity to make education more accessible to many Australians who, at present, are deprived of educational opportunities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The potential of open learning has been established. The problem that we all face now is to ensure that the direction of open learning is not corrupted by politics and that the standard of education is maintained. It is critical that the correct guidance is given for the development of this exciting and dynamic sector of the Australian education system. This is particularly the case when the enormous advances in technology in recent times are considered and their application to this area of open learning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Education providers should have the freedom to develop open learning in this country so that it meets the needs of the Australian people. Unfortunately, the flexibility needed is not likely to happen under the current Labor Government with its national unified system. This highly bureaucratic and inflexible system has shown that it cannot cope with the huge demand for places. This year, 50,000 eligible students were unable to obtain a place in universities and 150,000 were turned away from TAFE colleges. It certainly will not be able to cope with the tidal wave of demand for higher education building up in the adult and community education sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are all aware of the damage created by the attitude of Mr Dawkins to the higher education sector with his so-called national unified system. `Big is better' is his motto. This is simply not the case. That approach is anathema to the concept of open learning. The current attitude of the Government is to allow two major players to dominate the open learning game, with the Open Learning Technology Corporation initiative. This will allow only a few associated institutions into the game, hanging on vainly trying to achieve something in the face of government policy. It will leave the rest of the higher education institutions which have an interest in open learning out on a limb, with no association with this new learning model which will ultimately leave them all behind the times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Announced in the 1992 Budget was an open learning initiative based on a small pilot project commenced this year. It will be established from 1993 and will operate at a cost of $53m over the next three years. University accredited units of study will be provided through distance learning courses and television open learning programs. Participants will pay charges which approximate HECS contributions paid by other students. No government financial support will be provided after 1995. Clearly, the Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, must have been kidding himself if he believed the following statement that he made on Budget night:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In short, every Australian with access to a television and a letter box can now have access to a university education.</PARA>
<PARA>The Government's new plan has developed in the following way: in April 1991 the Australian Education Council working party set up a national education communications framework. In June 1992, the AEC, in conjunction with the Ministerial Council on Vocational Education, Employment and Training, or MOVEET, agreed to the recommendations of the working party establishing the new Open Learning Technology Corporation to provide brokerage and other functions related to open learning for education and training providers throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The corporation is intended to play a significant role in fostering the collaborative development of open learning in this country. Fortunately, all this planning will come to fruition after the next election and the coalition will be taking a very different approach. It will ensure that open learning, while given guidance and support, will not be subjected to the heavy-handed bureaucracy that the Government is currently proposing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the plan envisaged by the current Labor Government, we will see a system increasingly dominated by two higher education institutions&mdash;the University of Queensland and Monash University. This consortium, established to foster open learning, is already on the way to disintegration after only a few months in place and other questions must be raised about the current expressions of interest that have been called for in the open learning process. These were called for initially in July, with the closing date in September. This is an unusually short period for such a major area as the future of open learning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the reason for the rush? It would seem that the Government has election jitters. It is worried about the unmet demand for 50,000 tertiary places in universities and 150,000 TAFE positions and it wants to be seen to be doing something before it gets to the next election. It sees open learning as a convenient way out, hence the ridiculous claim in the Budget that every Australian with access to a television or letter box will have access to a university education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another problem with what has been suggested by Mr Baldwin in the Budget is the very suspect figures that he uses. It would appear that the Minister has not really done his sums properly; $53m would not seem to be enough to achieve the result that the Government is talking about. Certainly, the HECS fee will not cover much of the cost of open learning per student if it is done properly. Open learning is not about throwing instructional materials at someone and saying, `Turn up for an exam'. Open learning must also involve backup assistance such as proper conferencing feedback, vacation schools and a lot of very time-consuming assessment, guidance and counselling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the end, open learning, when carried out properly, is no cheaper than providing normal tuition, and all the research here in Australia and overseas supports that. Mr Baldwin's Budget announcement is merely a cheap political gimmick a few months before an election&mdash;something that appears to solve the problem of unmet demand.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The TV initiative that has been proposed has potential but it should be developed properly and carefully over time. The current plan will not help open learning in the long run and it still leaves tens of thousands of eligible students with no access to a tertiary education, plus the gathering demand of the adult and community education sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until universities and colleges are given the freedom to offer additional places to undergraduates beyond those funded by the Government, the problems of unmet demand in this country for higher education will not be solved. It follows that the institutions providing the services should be given the right to set realistic fees. This is the only way we will get supply and demand to balance in this sector. When this happens, rigid controls on undergraduate fees currently imposed will have broken down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The open learning initiative seems to be the beginning of the end of the Dawkins/Baldwin centrally regulated system. Once it is demonstrated that universities can be given financial freedom with regard to open learning, it should not be long before commonsense prevails and this freedom is extended to all aspects of higher education. That at least is the wish.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A Federal election will be held before anyone can tell whether Mr Baldwin's brave new world is going to be a success or a failure. Open learning needs the coalition's approach of freedom and flexibility so that demands on the education sector can be met and the needs of the users of education can be fulfilled. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is my first opportunity to speak in honour of Sir Harold White, who died on the last day of August and whose funeral service was held at St John's Church here in Canberra two days ago. Sir Harold was the great force behind the establishment and development of our Parliamentary Library and the establishment of the National Library of Australia. I fondly remember the years when I was a member of the Library Committee of this Parliament. I now serve as one of the two parliamentarians representing the Parliament on the Council of the National Library.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir Harold White was a great man. His intelligence, and his determination to build great institutions of knowledge and learning in this city for all Australians, ought to be clearly and gratefully remembered at the time of his passing. He was born in Victoria in 1905. He joined the Commonwealth Library at the age of 18 and retired at the age of 65. He gave almost 50 years service to the central library institutions of this country at the point of their formation. He was the Parliamentary Librarian for 23 years&mdash;almost a quarter of a century&mdash;from 1947 until his retirement from that position in 1970. Because the National Library of Australia grew out of our Parliamentary Library and was intended to grow from it, at the same time as being Parliamentary Librarian he was the first National Librarian from 1960 until his retirement eventually in 1970. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shape of the collections, and the services provided to parliamentarians in this building and to all Australian citizens in the National Library, owe a great debt to the carefulness of this most active man. When I think about the era in which he flourished, he stands alongside Sir Robert Menzies, the Prime Minister whom he knew so very well and whom he served, along with every member of parliament. It is in the Menzies generation that I salute Sir Harold White. I do not mean to imply that he had any particular sharing of the policy agenda of that great Prime Minister and founder of the Party that I belong to, but he is of that kind of stature, not only in terms of his contribution to the libraries of our country but also as a citizen of this country. I hold him in very high esteem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When he stayed on as the Parliamentary Librarian in his last years, it was not least to establish the legislative research service which is available and currently used by the great majority of parliamentarians to very real effect. I speak of a body of scores of well-qualified graduates with specialised interests and responsibilities to develop a comprehensive knowledge as a base for giving advice to every member of Parliament. We have a service in the Parliamentary Library which is incomparable with any that is given in any educational or library institution in this country. I particularly recognise his contribution to the establishment of that service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I met with Sir Harold White on a number of occasions. The time that I most remember was when the Queen was opening this new Parliament House in 1988. We happened to meet by the copy of the Magna Carta&mdash;one of the few original copies&mdash;which sets out one of the first great statements of the political rights and human rights of citizens. It is a foundational statement for parliaments anywhere at any time. Whilst I was in this new building seeing where this important document was being housed and exhibited, it happened that I met with Sir Harold again.</PARA>
<PARA>We talked in a very excited way about this great document. He related to me, as is well known to many, that he found this document himself and persuaded the government of the day to come up with $25,000&mdash;in 1952 it was #12,500&mdash;to make this purchase. Of course, it is worth millions of dollars now. It is very apt that we have such an original document of such foundation and importance in the history of all parliaments here in our building. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I also note that he knew all the Prime Ministers of this country closely, from Scullin onwards. He had dealings on a personal basis and as an adviser to Prime Ministers of all political persuasions throughout his lifetime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He is survived by his four children: David, who is a professor at the Melbourne University; John, who is the Chief Executive of the New South Wales Farmers Association; Judith, who is the director of research at a scientific institution in Paris; and Katherine, who is a research scholar at the University of Canberra. I pass on to them my own condolences at the passing of their father. I think I can speak in a representative capacity on behalf of all parliamentarians and, indeed, the public of Australia in recognising the contributions that their father, Sir Harold White, made to the benefit of us all. </PARA>

As a result of public comment on the previous draft, it was apparent that the terms "low level" and "intermediate level" as applied to radioactive waste lack sufficient precision for use in the Code of Practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) (b) The radionuclide activity concentration limits given in the 1992 draft have been increased compared with those in the 1990 draft because the public dose limit used to derive them has been raised from the arbitrary value of 0.5 millisievert used in the 1990 draft to the 1.0 millisievert public dose limit currently recommended by the NH&amp;MRC. However, the concept of a dose constraint has also been introduced in the 1992 draft meaning that other sources of exposure must be considered. In practice this could result in a reduction in the activity concentration limits for a specific facility. The choice of the value for this constraint is the responsibility of the appropriate authority as defined in the draft Code.</PARA>
