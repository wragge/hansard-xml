<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted.</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XG4">Senator GILES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The present plan replaces the existing management plan for this fishery with a new scheme based on individual quotas. In turn, these quotas are largely based on the total allowable catch for each species. At present a schedule to the plan sets out this total catch. Thus, the allowable catch for flathead is 3,000,000 kilograms live weight, that for redfish is 600,000 kilograms live weight, and so on. However, the plan also provides that the Manager may vary the allowable catch for a species. This is a legislative power. Further, it is a legislative power with important commercial consequences. Every time the allowable catch is varied the quota is automatically varied. Despite this, the variation is merely required to be notified in the<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Gazette</EMPHASIS>. There is no provision even for tabling, much less for disallowance. The Committee believes that it is essential that legislative changes of this type should be made by amendment of the principal instrument, which would result in full parliamentary scrutiny by way of tabling and possible disallowance.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As usual, I seek leave to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> a statement of the matters which the Committee has raised with the Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SOUTH EAST FISHERY (INDIVIDUAL TRANSFERABLE QUOTA) MANAGEMENT PLAN 1991</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(PLAN OF MANAGEMENT No. SEF1, No. 11 OF 1991)</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Plan, which replaces the South East Trawl Preliminary Management Plan, provides a management plan for the South East Fishery based on individual transferable quotas as a means of managing catch to provide for the sustainable utilisation of the Fishery. Quota units for specified species are determined by verified catch history over the period, or part of the period, 1984 to 1989 inclusive, as well as by units defined under the former Plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has several concerns with this instrument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, there are apparently incorrect cross-references in the body of the Plan, four references referring to provisions of another Act which do not exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Second, the Plan provides for a South East Fishery Quota Register, setting out in considerable detail the information that the Register is to contain. However, the Manager is then given power to include in the Register any other information the Manager considers relevant. This is a broad power and, although the Manager's actions are subject to AAT review, the Committee asked for details on the background of this provision. The Committee noted that a recent management plan for another fishery included details of a register but did not include such a power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Third, the Committee raised an important legislative power which was not subject to tabling and disallowance. It is this provision in respect of which the Committee agreed to give a notice of motion of disallowance. This provision deals with the total allowable catch, or TAC, for each species covered by the Plan, with the TAC set out in a Schedule to the Plan. However, the Minister is then given the power to vary the TAC from time to time for a species. This power is legislative in nature, with important commercial consequences, as the Plan provides that where a TAC is varied quotas are recalculated. The Minister is required to notify a variation in the Gazette but the variation is not subject to parliamentary scrutiny by tabling and disallowance. This Committee believes that on its face this is a case where variations to the total allowable catch should be made by amendments of the Plan, which are subject to disallowance in the same way as the principal Plan.<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to the Therapeutic Goods Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1992 No. 19, considered by the Committee at its meeting of 2 April 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New regulations 15(2) and 16F confer discretions on the Secretary, with no indication that they are subject to external review of their merits. These two provisions appear to have commercial importance. Therefore, the Committee would appreciate your advice on whether the discretions are subject to review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and, if not, whether it is intended to amend the regulations to provide such review. In this context, the Committee noted the generally good review provisions in the principal Regulations, some of which were included earlier to implement undertakings given to the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New rr.16C(3) and 16D(3) provide for periods of 175 days and 255 days for an evaluation to be concluded. Under r.16A(1) those periods exclude Saturdays, Sundays and public service holidays in the ACT. Therefore, the periods would appear to be some nine calendar months and one calendar year respectively. The Committee wishes to ensure that these periods are reasonable and not excessive. There is no explanation in the Explanatory Statement for the periods. However, the Explanatory Statement does advise that recommendations of Professor Peter Baume's "Report on the Future of Drug Evaluation in Australia" would all be adopted as a package. The Committee would appreciate your advice on whether these periods were recommended by Professor Baume and, if not, upon what basis the periods were decided.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New r.16E provides that, even if the strict time limits referred to in r.16D(3) are not met, then the Commonwealth, the Secretary or a delegate are not liable for any loss which arises from the failure. Again, the Committee would appreciate your advice on whether this exemption was recommended by Professor Baume. In this context the Committee noted new r.43AA, which provides that if there is a failure to meet the periods, the fee for evaluation will be reduced by 25%. The Committee asks whether it is intended for any other compensation to be paid to members of the public who suffer because public officials do not comply with the requirements of Commonwealth legislation. The Committee noted that there did not appear to be any corresponding provision for the same periods in r.16C(3).</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CANBERRA   ACT   2600</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Pat</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter dated 2 April 1992 in which you raised a number of queries concerning the changes made to the Therapeutic Goods Regulations ("the Regulations") by Statutory Rules No.19 of 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You stated that new regulations 15(2) and 16F of the Regulations do not provide review avenues to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Subregulation 15(2) was inserted to enable manufacturers to depart from the otherwise strict requirement in that regulation requiring them to display the registration or listing number of therapeutic goods on the label of the goods in a fixed manner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Display of such numbers is required under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 ("the Act"). There could be rare instances where it may be more convenient for the manufacturer to set out the product's registration or listing number in a way that does not conform to the requirements under subregulation 15(1) of the Regulations. In the event that such a circumstance should arise, subregulation 15(2) has been inserted to offer the manufacturer that option, but does not confer any rights upon the manufacturer. Subregulation 15(2) is not regarded as a provision that is likely to result in any disputes requiring resolution before any administrative or judicial body.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulation 16F prescribes the time limit within which applications under s.32(5) of the Act (to vary information contained in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods), must be completed. The decision making power to accept or reject such applications, whether because of the nature of the application or the substance of the application, lies under s.32(5) of the Act, and that decision is already appealable to the AAT under the terms of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You also queried whether the time limits for completing drug evaluations prescribed under rr.16C(3) and 16D(3) (providing for periods of 175 days and 255 days), together with r.16E which protects the Commonwealth from liability in the event of a failure to meet those deadlines, were based upon recommendations contained in Professor Peter Baume's "Report on the Future of Drug Evaluation in Australia". The time limits prescribed are actually less than what was recommended by Professor Baume in Recommendations 41 and 42 of his Report. Professor Baume envisaged that in the event that the time limits were not met, then the Department would lose 25% of the fee payable by sponsors seeking to register their drugs. No other sanctions were recommended for a failure to meet the prescribed time limits, nor does it appear to be intended that time limits be used by drug manufacturers to compel, under the threat of damages claims, strict adherence to timetables that could jeopardise the object of the Act which requires a balance (as recommended by Professor Baume) between timely availability of therapeutic goods and the safety, quality and efficacy of those goods when approved for release for use by the community at large. Regulation 16E corresponds to s.25(6) of the Act and likewise, in answer to your final question, r.43AA corresponds with s.24D(3) of the Act, which applies to the time limits set out under r.16C(3) of the Regulations.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Superannuation Guarantee Charge Bill imposes a charge based on any shortfall in superannuation contributions for employees.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SUPERANNUATION GUARANTEE (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill, which is to commence on 1 July 1992, will make consequential amendments to various Tax Acts, the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987 and certain Defence Acts as a result of the introduction of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Bill 1992 and the Superannuation Guarantee Charge Bill 1992 on 2 April 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tax Acts</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Income Tax Assessment Act 1936</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will amend the Income Tax Assessment Act to make the superannuation guarantee charge non-deductible for income tax purposes. This amendment is in accordance with the policy outlined in the December Information Paper on the superannuation guarantee charge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will also amend the Act to ensure that payments of the "shortfall component" of the superannuation guarantee charge made to a complying superannuation fund are treated as taxable contributions in the hands of the fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The final amendment will ensure that the arrangements for obtaining tax file numbers apply to facilitate the administration of the superannuation guarantee scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taxation Administration Act 1953</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Taxation Administration Act contains offences and prosecution provisions which create a number of offences of general application to the various Commonwealth tax laws and makes provision for their prosecution. It also contains provisions dealing with objections, reviews and appeals. The Bill proposes amendments to extend the list of provisions of taxation laws contained in that Act to include references to the corresponding provisions in the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Bill 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendment will ensure that decisions of the Commissioner of Taxation relating to liability for superannuation guarantee charge are not reviewable under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act but are reviewable instead under the separate objection, review and appeal provisions contained in Part 4 of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act 1980</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act provides criminal sanctions against persons who engage in transactions designed to ensure that a company or trust is rendered incapable of paying income tax, sales tax and certain other taxes or charges. (Such schemes are commonly known as "bottom of the harbour" schemes.)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments will also make it a criminal offence to enter into an arrangement with a purpose of securing that a company or trustee will be unable to pay the superannuation guarantee charge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An amendment will be made to the secrecy provisions in section 18 of the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act to allow the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner to publish a list of complying superannuation fund names and business addresses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment will allow those employers and members of the public who wish to contribute to complying superannuation funds for purposes of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Bill 1992 to have access to details which will enable them to contact the funds direct.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Defence Acts</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will amend the Defence Act 1903, the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1973 and the Military Superannuation and Benefits Act 1991 to ensure that the superannuation benefits for members of the Defence Force are consistent with the benefits required by the superannuation guarantee scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">REVENUE IMPACT</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Tax Acts and the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act are not expected to have a significant financial impact on the Revenue. The estimated impact of the additional benefits for members of the Defence Force provided as a result of the amendments proposed in this Bill will be approximately $6.9 million over the next 9 years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the Explanatory Memorandum which contains more detailed explanations of the provisions of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">TRAINING GUARANTEE (ADMINISTRATION) AMENDMENT BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Training Guarantee scheme was established by legislation introduced into this House on 18 May 1990, and it came into effect on 1 July 1990. It requires employers to spend a minimum amount on training, broadly defined.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The scheme was introduced as part of the Government's policy over the last several years to develop the appropriate environment in which Australian industry can become more competitive internationally. A fundamental step in this process is the development of a highly skilled workforce which can adapt quickly to major changes in the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The scheme is an additional mechanism to stimulate industry's commitment to training. It aims to increase the skills of the workforce by expanding employer investment in training and distributing more equitably the training effort among employers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We must prepare for an inevitable increase in demand for skilled people, as the economic recovery strengthens, by ensuring that our commitment to training in this country is maintained and increased. The Training Guarantee provides an important underpinning to achieving the necessary skilled workforce.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill amends the Principal Act to give effect to a recommendation made in the Report (the Finn Report) of the Australian Education Council Review Committee entitled "Young People's Participation in Post-Compulsory Education and Training". It also makes some minor technical amendments and a clarification.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Finn Report was commissioned by Australia's Ministers for Education and Training to report on the future development of post compulsory education and training in Australia. The report has provided new directions for the vocational education of young people whilst recognising the increasing convergence of vocational and general education.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In line with one of the Finn Report recommendations, the Bill provides for work experience and practice for students and teachers to be included in an eligible training program of an employer. This further provision in the Training Guarantee will provide a strong incentive for employers to provide work experience and practice opportunities. Work experience and practice are key ingredients to education and training. This prepares young people for entry into the workforce and strengthens the competencies of teachers in helping students meet industry requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill targets full-time students at or above the level of Year 10 or its equivalent who are under 21 years of age. This is consistent with the Finn Report's emphasis on young people. Provision is made for students undertaking courses in schools and education and training institutions including institutions which are registered under a State or Territory law. In some cases these may be a private sector institution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The student must be full-time in order to avoid inappropriate use of the provisions, such as employers releasing their employees for part-time study and being able to claim their employee costs as eligible expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In regard to teachers, provision is made for teachers in schools and institutions of the kind applying to students. Unlike full-time teachers, part-time teachers generally will be already gaining some work experience, or at least have the opportunity to gain such experience. Accordingly, the provision only applies to full-time teachers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also specifies that there is an agreement between the teacher and the training institution, and the training institution and the provider of work experience, which includes the terms and conditions under which the teacher may undertake work experience. This is to ensure that only genuine and formal work experience arrangements apply to full-time teachers. This is consistent with the aim of encouraging teachers to acquire industry experience and knowledge so they can pass this on to students when they return to the teaching institution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill inserts a provision that goods and services are to be provided within 13 months from the time the expenditure is incurred. This gives added force to the intent of the legislation that expenditure is not an end in itself and that the actual provision of training is the central purpose of such expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Bill makes provision for the Commissioner of Taxation to extend the time limit, should he decide it is appropriate to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the Bill also inserts provisions for an employer to use a standard cost per kilometre for expenditure incurred on prescribed vehicle travel to enable an employee or other person to attend an eligible training program. A regulation will be tabled as soon as possible to give effect to this.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In summary then, this Bill introduces some new aspects to the Training Guarantee in response to the Finn Report. It also makes amendments to current provisions to assist employers and facilitate the administration of the Training Guarantee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report deals with the manner in which the implementation of the pharmaceutical restructuring measures has been carried out by the Health Insurance Commission, the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority and the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services. It also covers the legislative framework put in place for the restructuring to proceed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These measures aim at reducing the number of pharmacies operated by pharmacists approved to dispense pharmaceutical benefits, so as to improve the efficiency and cost effectiveness of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Senators would remember the 1989-90 dispute between the Government and pharmacists over dispensing fees and the breakdown in negotiations which marked this dispute. Following resumption of relations and prolonged negotiations between the Government and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, an agreement was reached for a restructure of pharmacists' remuneration and of the retail pharmacy industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program of restructuring has been effected in three major areas of community pharmacy. First, the granting of new approvals to dispense pharmaceutical benefits is now subject to restrictions, whereas this was an automatic procedure for registered pharmacists whose premises had been approved and registered by the relevant State or Territory pharmacy board. Second, existing approved pharmacists in close proximity to another pharmacy, willing to close or amalgamate their businesses, can receive a lump sum proportional to their years of operation in their pharmacy. Third, pharmacists in remote areas can be paid a special allowance to ensure that residents in these areas have continued access to a community pharmacy and pharmaceutical benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The criteria which apply to each type of measure are contained in a formal agreement which also provides for the establishment of a special authority, the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority, to administer the program. The contents of the relevant part of this agreement were formalised by the enactment of amendments to the National Health Act 1953 in October and December 1990, and by the gazettal of a ministerial determination in January 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The required legislation was not finalised until six months after the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services announced, on 8 August 1990, that some restrictions in the granting of approvals were to be applied immediately. As a result, the initial stages of the restructuring program were carried out with insufficient legislative authority by the Health Insurance Commission, the Minister's media release providing the sole basis for the new procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This placed the Commission in a difficult position for a number of reasons. First, there had not previously been any government control on the number of pharmacies dispensing pharmaceutical benefits. Second, the granting of approvals had always been approached, by pharmacists and relevant government agencies alike, with a minimum of bureaucratic procedures although some legislative provisions were in operation. Third, the Health Insurance Commission received no specific directions from the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services or from the Minister for the introduction of the new approval measures in the period before the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority was set up. Fourth, very poor communication between the Commission's Central Office and its State offices resulted in the provision of inadequate or inaccurate advice to pharmacists on new requirements and procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The initial period of operations was marked by growing confusion among pharmacists, arising from lack of information on the restructuring and from inaccurate or conflicting advice from the Health Insurance Commission; and an accumulation of unprocessed applications for the closure or amalgamation payments and for the essential pharmacy allowance which could not be dealt with until the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority was in operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee found that the Authority had&mdash;and in some instances still has&mdash;its own difficulties to contend with. It had limited preparation time before commencing operations; it faced a large backlog of applications; key criteria for some of the restructuring measures were still not properly defined and some of the definitions it adopted were not in line with the intentions of the restructuring; the legislative backing for some of its operations was defective; and it has limited discretion to modify the criteria set. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The position of the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services in relation to these two statutory authorities has been an added source of difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA>It appeared to the Committee that all the agencies concerned were too eager to place responsibility for any faulty administration of the restructuring program on one of the other agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has examined a number of cases where administrative problems have led to questionable decisions. The Committee concluded that some of the decisions made in the early stages of the restructuring did not have a sound legal backing and has obtained legal opinion on several aspects of the legislative framework for the restructuring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has made recommendations concerning the future administration of the Authority. The Committee is concerned that certain matters revealed by its inquiry into the pharmaceutical restructuring measures have not yet been resolved and may require further reporting:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to ask a number of questions on this program. The Minister would be aware of the fact that during the Committee hearings I asked a number of questions about the proposal to remove the laboratory at Scottsdale to Maribyrnong in Victoria. Since the Estimates Committee hearings there has been a meeting with the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) on the issue and a delegation from Tasmania. There have been reports commissioned by the Public Sector Union on the Department's figuring and there have been submissions put by staff and by the union to the Minister. There are a number of questions which arise out of these developments as a result of the information that I was given in the Estimates and by way of answers to questions taken on notice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to, first of all, draw the attention of the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) to the fact that in these submissions it has been pointed out that the conclusion of the Committee that there were savings of $428,000 per annum is erroneous. I wonder whether we will now get an acknowledgment that this claim was quite out of order. That might be as good a place as any to start. The Price Waterhouse assumptions would be that the annual saving is more like $20,000 per year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This has not been an issue that I have directly dealt with at this stage and so I have not had a chance to look at the Price Waterhouse figures. What I can say to Senator Newman, as I think I have probably indicated at the Estimates Committee, is that a final decision on Scottsdale is yet to be made. I think that Minister Bilney has indicated that he is quite happy to hear delegations and counter submissions and, in political terms if you like, have the heavy roller put over it.</PARA></TALK.START>

But I really do have to wait until Minister Bilney returns to work before he can take these submissions into account, have an assessment of these submissions, compare them with the original submission to the Government and make the judgment of who is right and who is wrong. I am not in a position today to make the judgment as to who is right and who is wrong.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for that answer. I do hope that means, with the evidence that will be before the Government, that the laboratory will remain at Scottsdale because the evidence is pretty clear from the material I have seen that the Committee's conclusions were based on pretty unsatisfactory assumptions, at the very least.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw to the attention of the Minister that he now has in his Department submissions which demonstrate that a restructuring of the production and administration functions in Tasmania could achieve a reduction in running costs of approximately $150,000 and, therefore, it would cost approximately $130,000 more per annum with option 2, that is, to move to Maribyrnong, than to retain and restructure MRL Tasmania on its current site. So I assume, in the light of the previous answer I have had from the Minister, that where it can be demonstrated that restructuring can take place in Tasmania and that there is, as a result, a net saving to the Commonwealth by not moving it to Maribyrnong, that the decision would be made on those merits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do still find it very strange that we have had an admission&mdash;and it is quite clear on the face of the report and from the meeting we had with the Minister&mdash;that the Committee failed to investigate the possibility of restructuring MRL Tasmania. There was, in fact only one real option&mdash;or two options: leaving it unchanged in Tasmania or moving it to Maribyrnong. I find it very strange indeed that an examination of the option to restructure and leave it there was not undertaken. I do not really need the Minister to comment on that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will remind the Minister that at the Estimates Committee hearings I submitted some figures which were produced on 3 December 1991 by Dr Peter Dunn, the chief of the Protective Chemistry Division, in which he set out the comparative costs and staffing arrangements between MRL Tasmania and MRL Melbourne. At the time I submitted those, I think Mr Hagan said he did not think they were quite right, and I asked if I could have the correct figures. I asked particularly that I have them in time for the meeting with Minister Bilney the following week, and of course I did not receive them in time. I received them some time afterwards, which I found very unsatisfactory, but I told that to Minister Bilney during the delegation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been intrigued to have a look at the figures which were provided eventually to the question taken on notice. What they reveal is that the cost per staff member of running the MRL site in Sydney is $7,367. I think that is the site for which Mr Hagan has been responsible. I find the figure for Tasmania is now $8,094, according to these figurings, which is a little higher than Sydney but about twice the figure that is given for Victoria. I find these really very strange, and I would ask what has been done to the Melbourne figures that they should be so out of kilter with the figures for Queensland, Sydney and Tasmania. There are only four States with MRL costings on here, and Victoria seems to be the one that has been shown in an extraordinarily favourable light. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Be that as it may, that is not really where I am going with my questions, because I understand that there may be more than meets the eye to how the Tasmanian figures were arrived at. I ask on notice for a detailed break-up of how those figures for Tasmania were arrived at. I want a very detailed break-up of those support costs that go to make up the $8,094 per capita. I see that the Minister is prepared to accede to my request. I point out that the reason for my wanting such detail is that included in this amount of $201,000 is travel, office requisites, post and telephone, fuel, light and power, freight, training, computer services, advertising, technical support and incidentals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of these items, such as travel, are cost elements which Mr Hagan has admitted are the direct costs of undertaking research programs. Those elements, by his own admission, should not be included in the general per capita cost per staff member. However, there is something very interesting to learn through looking at the fuel, light and power, post and telephone, and technical support costs for Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are elements which, particularly in Tasmania, relate to the program rather than the staff per head costs. I say that because in Tasmania, in doing a freeze-dried program, the consumption of fuel, light and power is quite large. About 60 per cent to 70 per cent of those fuel, light and power bills relate to the production of the freeze-dried meals, rather than to providing air-conditioning, heating and lighting for the offices, as would be expected in most laboratories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the remaining 30 per cent of the bill, some is used to operate equipment which consumes a large amount of power, such as ovens, incubators, sterilisers and other scientific instruments. The post and telephone bills are higher because the research programs are sponsored and they are required to be done in collaboration with Australian industry, preferably to produce commercial products. So that requires a lot of liaison with manufacturers and researchers over the whole of Australia. But once again, it is program oriented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The technical support costs have been higher in 1991-92 than in other years because there have been some one-off field studies which have required a contractor to undertake specialised analyses. So we must look deeper than just the raw figures. As I said, the important factor in those costs that I have just highlighted is that they are related to the nature of the work rather than to the number of staff engaged in the activities, so the per capita costs of work done in one laboratory cannot be fairly compared with the costs of work done in another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be handy, just for interest's sake, to see how they are operating, but I find the way that Dr Dunn broke up his figures, which are not directly comparable to these ones that were given in the answer on notice, is a much more interesting indicator of efficiency. I do need those detailed costs, and I am grateful to the Minister for having indicated that he will give them to me. </PARA>

I am saying that the motivation for thinking of closing Scottsdale is to save money. That is not to say that we are insensitive to the social concerns that we may leave behind there: we are.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would draw attention to Senator Ray's statements earlier this week in opening the DSD facility as to how he looked after the people he was trying to encourage to come to Canberra. I would have thought that considerations of caring for staff would have applied across the board, and that if he was doing a calculation of the costs of moving a facility he would recognise, as he did with DSD, that some people would not come and that he would have to make provision for the people that he has had for years. Some of the technical staff he has had for 16 years. Their redundancy payments will be quite substantial, and I would expect that he will not just dump them.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think there are two possibilities. I must say my remarks in terms of DSD were not so much in terms of redundancies as in terms of incentives to move. This may be a slightly analogous situation, but the DSD people are so highly trained that they are very hard to replace. We will only find out in the wash how many people will transfer from Scottsdale to Melbourne, and whether they would need an incentive to do so I cannot say at this stage. Generally housing costs would be expected to be higher in Melbourne than in Scottsdale, and usually in those circumstances if one wanted to retain staff one would do it via housing loans and other activities. As to whether potential redundancy costs were ever calculated into the figures, I will seek an answer.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If one is  to have a realistic assessment of the cost of moving a facility, one cannot ignore the costs that one will be obliged to pay under awards or public sector rules or whatever. It is pretty dishonest, I would have said, not to have included some kind of an assessment for what the redundancy costs would be. Senator Ray was talking about housing, and saying that if one is going to have incentives to encourage people to move that should also be included. Equally, he reminds me of the fact that in Scottsdale we are talking about a very small country community. We are talking about something like 10 people suddenly having to pack up and sell their houses, and we are going to have a great problem in selling 10 houses in a small community. There is every chance of a great loss of value, even if they can sell them, with all of them coming onto the market at the same time. If the Committee's assessment of costs had been at all professional, those are things for which there should have been some kind of an assessment or allowance. That is one example of why I feel it is a most unsatisfactory report.</PARA></TALK.START>

That was provided in both options, but it has not been possible to verify the appropriateness of the figure. I do not expect that the Minister could do it today, but I would like to have that question taken on notice. Equally, a 14 per cent loading on salary costs was provided for management overheads in assessing both options. There was no indication of how that was arrived at, so there has been no ability to assess the appropriateness of that figure, and I would be grateful for that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The final item relating to this that I wish to refer to is the commercial potential of the laboratory. I asked, in the Estimates Committee, whether there was a restriction in the terms of reference for looking at this issue or not. I was told, `No, we did look into whether or not there was a commercial proposition for that freeze-drying facility; there are two issues, basically: it has a limited capacity to produce so, therefore, it can serve a specialist, small volume market'. I said, `Well, it could be expanded; not everything has been downsized in Australia today'. I was told, `I do not believe that we have a charter to invest in an infrastructure for purely commercial purposes'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not wanting to analyse every word in that response, I would have thought that the response was rather contrary to the thrust of the Government's policy for DSTO, that the very establishment of a commercial arm of DSTO would have suggested that there is a charter to go down the commercial line. If that requires an investment in infrastructure, so be it. It is a pretty important element in the future viability of that facility at Scottsdale to realistically consider its commercial opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, in Tasmania there is very real recognition that the facility has much more opportunity for expansion than has ever been considered in the past. I wonder whether the Minister would care to comment on the policy of the Government towards commercialisation of DSTO's very special talents and abilities?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The commercialisation of DSTO is essentially in marketing what it discovers, and not in producing. Scottsdale is a rather unique by continuing research and also production. It got into that production when virtually no-one else in Australia was into that form of production. There are now at least two other companies that do it very substantially.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would not argue that there is a potential for expansion of Scottsdale into commercial activities, but I ask: why should it be funded by Defence if it is not providing Defence needs? It is an argument we are having elsewhere in the portfolio. I think we would take a bipartisan attitude on certain activities that we are currently in, especially the aerospace industry. It will be time soon to get out because it does not have a military relevance, although we still have concerns to make sure the expertise continues in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the question cannot be answered in terms of just referring back to DSTO's more commercial imperative&mdash;that is, to research things, to discover things, to invent things, to patent things and to sell that expertise on; not actually to produce the Jindalee over the horizon radar or other items. If the honourable senator is suggesting to me that we should expand Scottsdale&mdash;going into commercial products for campers and all the rest of it as a government funded enterprise&mdash;I am afraid that that is a form of socialism that has not worked in eastern Europe, and she would surprise me very much. It is more a comment that one of her National Party colleagues would have made. If it does have potential benefits outside the Defence area, then no doubt someone will pick it up and continue running with it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no motivation not to. If the proposition were ever brought to me that we have to retain the production of a facility there, but to achieve economies of scale we have to do a bit of selling on the side to keep the economies of scale going et cetera, again, I would not reject that out of hand. I would not just say, `No, it can produce only for the Defence Force'. But if we, for some reason or other, just wait for the other competitors to come down on us like a house of bricks, they will say that it is unfair competition because we are not taking into account all the overheads and all the rest of it. We have been through that argument before.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not preclude the possibility, but I do not think we, as a defence department, can give it a large expansion and go in commercially against other companies. I think that was also unfair, outside the scope of the Defence Force and not really in line with the commercialisation of DSTO; it is a slightly separate subject. But, if it were on a minor scale and we did not get objections and there were economies of scale, then it would be a sensible thing to do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister. I was not suggesting that we go down the Eastern European road to happy socialism, I was in fact looking at whether one could go down the corporatisation road that one has already travelled with ADI. For example, it is producing items which are important for the Defence Force, but it is also producing surplus, either for Defence exports or for sale to private customers in Australia. It seems to me that we have got a very good model there already. It might only be the first stage of future changes but, nevertheless, one could have a very specialised facility there which I believe could be doing more than it is.

I feel that serious attention has never been given to the opportunities that Scottsdale provides. It seems to me that it would be very logical in the future for Scottsdale to have the fine research and development centre that we have got there collocated with some form of production facility which is not just providing for the defence forces now. We can discuss, until the cows come home, exactly what form that should take, but I was very disappointed that that committee report really did not look at that at all, because it is an essential element of considering the future of the research centre as well as the future provision of freeze-dried foods for the defence forces.

Without wanting to get into a debate on the attempted red herring by Senator Crichton-Browne, I am still interested in the assertion made in the Committee's report about career opportunities and staff development, et cetera.

<PARA>I acknowledge that he qualifies that later. If, in qualifying it, reasons are given in the Committee's report, I would like to think that those reasons were not just judgments made without the basis or the benefit of fact, but rather that there was some sort of list which compared and contrasted the staff development activities and the career development possibilities in Melbourne versus Scottsdale. If there is no such list, I suggest that that assertion is founded on a vacuum. I would suggest that, before that statement is given any credibility at all, such a list should be compiled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other suggestion that was made was about the alternative uses of the facility if, for example, this decision was eventually made.

I know that the Minister said to Senator Newman that it was not central to the Defence Department or anybody else who is associated with the operation of this to look for a commercial operation, but if you are going to make decisions based on cost, such as how much it costs to heat the place, et cetera, why was no consideration given to maximising the economic benefit which might derive from using the existing facilities and the capital equipment which is sitting there idle for a considerable part of the time?</PARA>

ASTA, on the other hand, would be lucky to be currently doing 40 per cent defence work, projected to reduce.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All I have at this stage is a general note on the underlying strategy that we are going to employ in developing specific programs. We are working on this in the context of the forthcoming inaugural meeting of ICORC, the International Conference on the Reconstruction of Cambodia, which is going to take place in Japan in June. It is envisaged that the program would aim at social and economic development, emphasising humanitarian objectives, while providing some scope for developing linkages with Australian economic interests, especially in the infrastructure and planning fields.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the medium term, the strategy is to build upon the current informal program, run through the NGOs, and to develop support for assistance projects in the agriculture, health, education and infrastructure sectors. In the short term, Australian assistance is to concentrate on the resettlement and rehabilitation processes for Cambodian people, with a special assistance program to be implemented by NGOs. The current level of the informal program is $6.4m. This existing program is being implemented by NGOs and through contribution to some multilateral agencies. An additional $2m for bilateral activities has been approved for disbursement this year, 1991-92. There is also another $7.7m this financial year from emergency and refugee funds. We are moving up to an annual disbursement target for bilateral aid of $15m by 1994-95. What that means over the next three years is a program increasing by $6m, $7m, and $8m, respectively. To try to translate that at this stage into more detailed programs and projects is simply premature. I am now told that has not yet got to that stage of planning. Presumably, we will be pretty well-equipped by the time of the conference in Japan to give some more chapter and verse on that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise the issue because of concern being expressed by some of the NGOs who feel that they have made a significant contribution in difficult circumstances in areas of vital importance. The Cambodian people&mdash;and the Minister, no doubt&mdash;witness some of their programs in training in agricultural development, as I have done. Their concern is now how their efforts will relate to the Government's bilateral program. In effect, is the Government simply going to usurp their program and implement it through other methods? It might be through consultants, or the normal way in which the Government calls for tenders for the implementation of a bilateral program. Are the NGOs going to be able to continue their programs?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at the figures that the Minister has put, $6.4m already goes to the NGOs. I suppose the first question really is: is that intended to be continued in those terms? If that is to be continued in those terms with the NGOs basically being permitted, subject to the usual assessment processes, to continue their worthwhile programs, then their concerns may well be put at rest. If it is simply to grow from the current $6.5m to $15m over the space of the next couple of years, with some additional funding from emergency and refugee matters coming out of other parts of the aid vote, then it seems there is not a lot of fat in that to develop any other major bilateral development program in any event.

But those points apart: the program is, I think, a realistic one. The target figure is getting up to $15m a year within three years, bearing in mind all the other bilateral obligations we have.

Perhaps with some attention in that direction he would find that, not only could he accommodate the sorts of savings that we are talking about, but he could produce a better result towards those who deserve benefit, particularly those living in poverty in the region that he now says he wants to help, a region which he says should see the concentration of effort of his program.</PARA></TALK.START>

That is, of course, subject to the necessary assessment from time to time that those programs are achieving the objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Can I, therefore, take the Minister on to Vietnam and ask a similar question? As I recall it, the Minister has announced a program for Vietnam of $100m over four years. I am not sure whether that is intended to be $25m per year or whether it is on an increasing scale to accommodate $100m in four years. I would ask the Minister whether he is now about to give some details of that program. There have been press releases that I have found somewhat confusing because the early statements from the Minister and others in the Government&mdash;I think it was largely announced by Minister Dawkins when he was in Vietnam&mdash;talked about programs that would have an orientation towards social needs, such as health programs, training programs. More recent statements by the Government have suggested that the program will basically be a commercially orientated program. I therefore ask for clarification of that matter. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the strategy, we will emphasise the development of mutually beneficial long term economic and commercial linkages, acknowledging the need for Australia to position ourselves to take advantage of the kind of economic growth which we can expect to occur once the US lifts its trade embargoes and relations with the financial institutions are resumed. But simultaneously&mdash;and it is possible to  have two objectives simultaneously: to walk and to chew gum at the same time&mdash;we are taking cognisance of the fact that Vietnam remains one of the very poorest countries in the region, with a GNP of only around $US200 per capita compared with, say, $1,000 for Thailand. So there will be that focus running as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of specific program activities, we have now had some recent discussions with the Vietnamese state planning committee in which it was agreed that Australia would be involved in the following sectors: education and training, including the possible establishment of an English language training centre; a sponsored training program and a technical and vocational training project; health, including a project in a priority area such as malaria control; infrastructure, including possible water supply projects involving three provincial towns; and natural resources development, including a forestry project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, it was agreed that in the short term there would be a commodities program which would, in the first instance, include the provision of fertiliser and pharmaceuticals and some associated equipment for Vietnam's malaria control program. It was also agreed that there would be an economic linkages program. That needs to be further developed, but AIDAB will be shortly approaching the SPC with a proposal for a feasibility study on that; and that will encompass requests for assistance with training, international finance banking, and management, and include a suggestion also that Australia provide some assistance with the revision, or further development, of legislation affecting international trade and development.

There will be some DIFF funding available. What it will be and how it will fit within that larger pattern of expenditure is still in the process of being resolved.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Part of the press speculation which I understood had resulted from ministerial statements concerned funding to assist with Australian industry in communication projects in Vietnam. There was an argument put a year or two ago that Australia was unsuccessful in certain telecommunications contracts, if I remember correctly, as a result of being undermined by mixed credit or other soft loan support from competitor governments. I noticed that that was not included in the lists that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) has just read to the chamber. Is that to indicate that support for that sort of commercial activity has been abandoned, or was it never the case? The Minister winces, but the point is that some of us do wonder why the Australian Government desired to be the first of the international community to resume bilateral aid programs with Vietnam when there has been very little improvement in the human rights position in Vietnam at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know this Government has lost a bit of interest in human rights in recent years, although Senator Evans sought to rationalise recent statements made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). Basically, the Prime Minister even dismissed taking into account human rights within the assessment of whether Australian taxpayers' money should be given in aid to Third World countries. I think we have a right to ask exactly what the Government is seeking to achieve through this bilateral program with Vietnam at this time. Even the Nordic countries, which continued programs throughout the period that others withdrew in Vietnam, now see the importance of an element of conditionality in aid programs. What signal are we seeking to communicate to the Vietnamese Government in leaping ahead in reintroducing our bilateral program? Our interpretation of that signal obviously relates to the type of program that the Government is envisaging. We accept that Vietnam is desperately poor. Certainly, the NGO aid lobby in Australia, as we heard yesterday, continues to argue and in fact it congratulates the Government on reintroducing its program in Vietnam, simply on the basis that it is a country in desperate economic straits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But if the program is purely orientated towards those most in need&mdash;this could come within the types of subject matters the Minister mentioned such as helping with malaria control, water supplies and also helping with some educational assistance&mdash;the Minister may well be able to develop an argument on humanitarian grounds. However, if the Government is really intending to have a commercial program funded or supported through aid moneys which will basically&mdash;directly or indirectly&mdash;go towards giving comfort and support to the Vietnamese Government, a government that is not prepared to reform its human rights record, I think that raises other matters that are relevant for consideration by the Australian Parliament. Are we seeking to sponsor and support major commercial projects, such as those in the telecommunications area, under the guise of assisting those most in need when in fact it will not really assist those most in need at all?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If he does not understand any of that he is not properly discharging his functions as a spokesman for any party in this country on foreign affairs and aid matters. That is just integral to an understanding of the way in which development assistance works. There is always a question that arises about the extent to which government funding ought to be made available for the support of major economic development projects in circumstances where those particular projects are capable of generating some economic return of a measurable kind, such as would justify the investment, quite apart from external aid-type support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is that particular issue in respect of which, as I have already mentioned, the OECD has&mdash;with strong support from Australia&mdash;been trying to inject some discipline into the situation. It may well be that a proper application of those OECD criteria would technically rule out, quite apart from any policy decision, the applicability of DIFF-type assistance as we have known it to a number of those commercial projects, and properly so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My own strong view is that aid money should not be used for economic development projects which are capable of generating commercial returns. But it is a very different matter to say that aid should not be used under any circumstances in support of what are essentially infrastructure projects which are crucial to a country's economic development. It then just becomes an argument as between short term measures of alleviation of poverty and short term humanitarian needs and longer term measures which are aimed at exactly the same objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not going to go any further in trying to deliver a lecture on aid policy, because it is obviously falling on deaf ears. I am just saying that any mindless assertion that the only kind of legitimate justification for the expenditure of aid money is on short term poverty alleviation&mdash;strictly, immediately humanitarian needs&mdash;is to completely misunderstand the utility of development assistance in creating better conditions, better lives, for the people in the countries that we are trying to help. And that will always be&mdash;so long as this Government is around&mdash;a key element in our approach to aid delivery. It is a matter of getting the balance right between the short term needs, which are acute and compelling, and the medium to longer terms needs, which are also eminently justified for the sorts of reasons I have indicated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How all this will work out in a Vietnam context I am unable to precisely describe at this stage. There is a difficulty, quite apart from the technical policy problems about the applicability of DIFF to particular kinds of projects, there is a threshold question, as to whether the kind of mixed facilities of DIFF and EFIC that have usually been made available elsewhere are properly applicable to Vietnam, or should be made applicable without the back-up of national interest cover. The difficulty is that there is $25m already allocated for export credits under that national interest account. That has been fully utilised, and it would be a matter of the Government having to earmark some further money for that purpose, unless we take the view that this does not need to be supported under the national interest cover regime, and that DIFF in its ordinary form is capable of being utilised without that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are difficult, tricky questions that are still being addressed, and it is simply premature for me to give  a response. My own belief is that there will be some projects in the public sector which will justify, under both OECD and other policy considerations, DIFF-type support, but I cannot quantify how much that will be at this stage, and how it will fit into the larger pattern of aid disbursement. For the moment the only areas that we are clear about are the ones that I described in some detail, which are a combination&mdash;as I have said&mdash;of health and forestry and social infrastructure of one kind or another that I have already listed, combined with this concept of an economic linkages program which involves mainly management-type training, all of which are in the process of development. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have already made plenty of public pronouncements upon this. I will simply be repetitious, but here we go. The human rights situation in Vietnam is not a totally acceptable one, not a totally ideal one. It falls considerably short of that in terms of continuing imprisonment of significant numbers of people on political grounds, and a continuing intolerance of any significant form of political dissent. But that is not a new situation, and it is not possible to argue that the situation is deteriorating in any manifest way, I think, in that respect. If anything, it is the contrary: there is a process of economic liberalisation at work, and I think one can reasonably expect, over time, some gradual relaxation to occur on the political front as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a human rights environment of that kind, the question arises as to whether you would secure any policy change by making aid delivery conditional upon some particular set of identified improvements. We have made the judgment that to try to apply aid in a crude policy way in this fashion&mdash;although there are circumstances where that may, conceivably, be effective&mdash;is not likely to be effective here; in fact, to the contrary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole approach of the Vietnamese Government to external pressure of one kind or another has been one of very stubborn resistance over the years. It is just a matter of making a judgment that an improvement in the human rights environment is more likely to be achieved, not by that approach, but rather by a combination in the first place of developing the kind of close and constructive dialogue relationship that enables a country like Australia to work persistently away on individual cases&mdash;a process which has, I believe, borne some obvious fruit in recent times&mdash;and, secondly, an approach which looks to the longer term and says that the best way one can create an improved human environment is not to keep a country turned inward upon itself but to open it up, expose it to trade and to economic development, get some ferment going in the community as a whole, led initially by that economic process, as a result of which it is reasonable to expect that there will be an evolution of political attitudes accompanying that. That may or may not be an over-optimistic view as to the process at work, but it does seem to us to be at least a reasonable premise on which to move forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, Vietnam is a country of 65 million people which is conspicuously under-developed at the moment. The absence of support from the international financial institutions and from major donors like the United States and others has meant that the economy has been lagging way behind what it is capable of achieving with all the accumulated misery that it has brought to so many of its people. So, weighing and balancing all of those factors, and in the absence of any recent examples like Tiananmen Square or Burma or other kinds of government-driven impacts of a negative kind on human rights such as would justify a very specific and immediate response, we believe that the way we have gone is the way that makes the most sense for the great mass of the Vietnamese people. </PARA>

That is being conducted by Kinhill Engineers, and is an Australian consultancy operation&mdash;in Hanoi, presumably&mdash;in May-June this year. That is to create a basis of expertise within the country so that projects can be better identified. Other things are taking the form, at this tentative, initial stage, of proposals to bring people to Australia for training. The supply of goods and the delivery of goods will be distributed through the best available distribution systems. Presumably, since we are talking about a centrally planned economy, that will often involve necessarily having to work through government agencies. I will be happy to supply this information as it comes to hand, as particular projects are bedded down. But at the moment I can do no more than give that indicative list. </PARA>

For example, under one DIFF program a matter was raised by Senator Alston previously about the supply of ultrasound machines to the Chinese family planning organisation in the Sichuan province. The Committee should be reminded that the ratio of girls to boys under two years old in China at the present moment is 89 girls to 100 boys. One wonders what the ultrasound machines are being used for at the present moment. This is not the sort of thing that one ought be assured of by the Vietnamese authorities; I suppose their assurances are worth about as much as those of the Chinese authorities. Our aid should be based on a true understanding of whether or not it is going to be used in a manner which would exacerbate the violations of human rights involved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is unfortunate that we are in a bit of a rush here because, as the Committee will have known, on this computer contract there were unanswered questions which needed to be clarified. I remind the committees that this is about the weight that the Government and the Department gives to the purchase of computer technology from Australia and the purchase of computer hardware and software from Australian industries. I preface my questions by reminding the Minister and the Committee of paragraph 4 of one of the tendering documents, which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has directed Commonwealth agencies not to draw up purchasing specifications including technical, performance and delivery requirements so as to exclude Australian and New Zealand products which are suitable or reasonably adaptable to Commonwealth needs or to evaluate offers in a manner which is biased against Australian and New Zealand suppliers.</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of my questioning was to ascertain whether or not in purchasing computer hardware and software for the ADCNET program, DFAT had in fact conformed with that requirement. I asked a number of questions at the committee stage and subsequently I put on notice certain other questions and those questions and the answers are now on pages 179 to 185 of the Estimates Committee B additional information report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At page 185 there appears one of the reasons that the Department gave for opting for the HP solution and the HP terminals as against the Labtam terminals, which are an Australian product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked the Department about Labtam X-terminal technology being at the cutting edge of that sort of technology generally, but I did make it a general question. The Department has chosen to talk about the X-terminal technology&mdash;which is reasonable enough, since that is the area which we are considering. The Department, in response, tried to bag the X-terms offered by Labtam on the basis of the tempestising that was proposed to be done by Lynwood, using containment techniques. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frankly, that seems to me to be building a straw man, because Labtam had provided Compucat, which was to do the tempestising for Hewlett-Packard, with terminals. Indeed, it was prepared to utilise anybody&mdash;there was only two firms, I think&mdash;but utilised Compucat for that particular purpose, if that was desired. The Department suggests that what looks to be a major reason for its not choosing the X-terminal technology provided by the Australian firm was that the weight would make the terminals ergonomically unsuitable for an environment office as used by DFAT. I am interested to know what the total weight of the Labtam product would have been had Compucat done the tempestising. Secondly, is it not a fact all 20-inch large monitors weigh some 30 kilograms?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that, if Senator Harradine looks at the preceding page, 184, he will see that that question was specifically addressed. In the top half of the page there is a paragraph beginning:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labtam did not make any formal tender offer to DFAT in regard to the tempestising of products by Compucat. Nevertheless, DFAT considered the possibility of having Labtam X Terms tempestised by Compucat . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That paragraph goes on to describe the difficulties that nonetheless were perceived as existing, in terms of that being followed through, with Compucat itself apparently being reluctant to proceed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is not just a matter of a quick judgment being made as to the weight or clumsiness or whatever of the competing bits of equipment and the form in which they were tendered. It was also a matter of having regard to the possibility of that tempestising being done in another way by Compucat and maybe bringing the products closer together. But then, as the honourable senator would see from that paragraph, a new problem arose in relation to that. We have to see the whole set of answers as a totality. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am seeing the whole thing as a totality and I see the result as being a bias against the Australian firm. Compucat had been contacted by HP to do the tempestising on their product. Clearly, that must be borne in mind. Senator Evans asks me to bear things in mind&mdash;I am bearing that in mind. Compucat had been contacted by HP to do the tempestising on their particular product. Another firm has been contacted by Labtam to do its tempestising. If this was a significant matter, it seems to me that the problems could have been overcome by discussions with the Australian firm but discussions with the Australian firm did not take place. The Australian firm, as I understand it, was not advised of the tempestising problems by DFAT or by HP until the last minute; nor were they advised by DFAT or by HP of certain problems relating to integration with the total HP solution. The point is&mdash;I only mention this so that the Committee knows the situation&mdash;that this Australian firm had to go through HP, Hewlett-Packard, to offer its services and its X terminals, and those terminals were in direct competition with HP's terminals. I cannot see how anybody could judge that to be fair.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer to page 184 which says that Compucat was reluctant to proceed with the Labtam option for reasons other than commercial ones, that is, practical manufacturing ones relating to the high variability of Labtam components. But even if that problem was capable of resolution through discussion, or whatever, of the kind that Senator Harradine is referring to, it does need to be appreciated that this ergonomic matter was only one of three grounds which led the tender evaluation process to come down the other way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other two grounds were, briefly, accreditation and software-hardware incompatibility. I will just say a quick word about each of those to put this in context. On the accreditation issue the situation is that ADCNET is, of course, a secure communications project. Equipment for use in my Department, under that project, has to be security accredited in accordance with Defence Signals Directorate standards. I am advised that Labtam has not started the accreditation process, which takes several years. Therefore, it could not realistically expect to be accredited to meet the Department's timetables. In particular, security accreditation has to be for a total system&mdash;computers, network and terminal hardware and software&mdash;which Labtam alone could not provide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this business of software-hardware incompatibility, the situation was, in short, that Labtam provides computer terminals. However, Labtam could not provide the software features which would permit secure use of the system, which the Department requires. Moreover, Labtam did not have a program in place for meeting future requirements for secure use. HP, the successful tenderer, is providing terminals which meet the Department's current security requirements and it does have a program in place for the provision of multiple level secure software, which the Department requires in the future. No doubt we could debate the detail of each one of those but, with the utmost respect to Senator Harradine, I wanted to put in context what he was saying and to make it clear that the ergonomic thing, while it was obviously important&mdash;it was one of the three grounds&mdash;it was not the crunch issue which resulted in this tender going the way that it did. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to take the opportunity of this matters of public interest discussion to speak on the Government's response to the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody report, which outlines a program principally aimed at correcting the gross over-representation of Aboriginal people in custody and at tackling problems of alcoholism.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hand in hand with these concrete proposals, of course, is the current reconciliation process which informs the whole process of reform and is the vehicle which is needed to carry the reforms to success. The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) has said the following of the current process of reconciliation between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This process of reconciliation must carry with it the complete rejection of the concepts of superiority and inferiority which have informed Australian society over the past 200 years.</PARA>
<PARA>In describing the nature of the process he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We've got to ensure that non-Aboriginal people have an increased understanding about Aboriginal history, culture and dispossession and we need the empathy and the commitment of non-Aboriginal people to ensure that that disadvantage is addressed.</PARA>
<PARA>It is concepts of superiority by non-Australians, back to the time of the arrival of the First Fleet, that set in train the sequence of events that have inexorably led to the grim picture revealed by the royal commissioners in relation to black deaths in custody. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This situation existed from the arrival of the First Fleet. Convicts and officers alike had mainly come from a society which is notorious for its class distinctions and its need to arrange everyone into a hierarchical order. It appears that convicts, most of whom came from the bottom of the heap in England, felt that they had at last found a group whom even they could look down on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent extreme reaction in England to criticism of England's role in Australia's war during World War II and to so-called insults to the Queen centred on a class based classification of us as convict descended, lower class, uncultured oafs. The English judgment of us raised our antagonism because we felt that they had no understanding of our society, that they were imposing standards which apply in their own society and that basically they had no right to even judge us. Their judgment did not materially affect us because they are over there and, of course, we are over here running our own affairs. I think it piqued Australians all the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a trivial example compared to what Aborigines faced at the hands of the British, but it should give us a glimpse of what they did face, suddenly being overrun by an alien society which knew nothing about their lifestyle, their culture, their religion and their relationship to the land, and who condemned them out of hand and widely believed that they should just be allowed to die out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So whilst I am strongly supportive of the initiatives taking place and believe that they are essential to a new beginning between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people, I do not want to see the warm glow generated by the establishment and completion of the Royal Commission and the united response to it serve as an end in itself. I do not want the current wrangling over funding to be an excuse for our once again failing Aboriginal people. I do not want the wider community to retreat into complacency and think, `Well, we've taken care of that&mdash;now on to something new'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Remembering the famous quote, `Those who do not know history are forever condemned to repeat it', I would like to recap some of the matters that we should never be allowed to forget, relating specifically to black deaths in custody and more generally to the sad history of Aboriginal people since the time of white settlement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of Aboriginal people have been unhappy with the findings of the Royal Commission, in that no readily identifiable and punishable enemy was named and no simple solution was found. I can understand their frustration and impatience after 200 years of injustice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have sympathy with the position of the royal commissioners, who obviously believed that, in circumstances where the truth was disputed and in circumstances where no definite proof of wrongdoing was available, they needed to tread cautiously and could not in all conscience condemn individuals. Whilst I appreciate this dilemma, I believe that a recognition of societal evils and general problems of community disadvantage should not absolve individuals of responsibility for their own actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the police are concerned, it has been said that the best we can expect of attitudes to Aborigines in the police force is that they reflect community attitudes&mdash;that we can not reasonably expect more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not accept that. I recognise fully the stresses police face daily in carrying out their duties but they are given immense power over ordinary citizens and their general behaviour must reflect the standards we would expect to go hand in hand with that power. Any person who cannot do this is not suited to be in the police force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to this issue, I would like to comment on two of the black deaths in custody, those of John Pat and Eddie Murray. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">John Pat died of head injuries in a police cell on 28 September 1983. He was 16 years old. The Perth City Coroner, David McCann, made history by committing five policemen to trial for manslaughter, the allegation being that they beat John Pat on arrest, kicked him in the face, dragged him into the police vehicle and later into a cell, and left him unattended. He was later found dead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the eyewitness evidence of Aboriginal witnesses, the all-white jury found the police not guilty. Surviving Aborigines arrested with John Pat were, on the other hand, charged with aggravated assault against the police officers and convicted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The finding of the West Australian Royal Commissioner in relation of John Pat was that no criminal act was committed against John Pat. He found that the fatal injury was suffered when Pat fell to the ground in a fight with police, that Pat was most probably kicked by a policeman as he was being dragged to the police van and that he was assaulted by police in the lockup yard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He concluded that, even on the best interpretation of the evidence, the police had shown a lack of care towards their prisoner and he described individual acts by police as disgraceful, provocative, unprofessional, ill-advised, foolish and unwarranted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aborigines must really begin to wonder when non-Aboriginal behaviour in relation to Aboriginal people becomes a criminal act, especially in view of the graphic picture of how easy it is for an Aborigine to be arrested that we received recently from the ABC documentary on Redfern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, the pattern of Aboriginal arrests and, usually, convictions is one of vagrancy, drunk and disorderly charges, petty theft, street and domestic assault, and resisting arrest charges. Serious charges of violence and murder are most often domestic, as indeed is the case in the wider community. One cannot help wondering whether this is a pattern more serious than the behaviour described by the Royal Commissioner in John Pat's case. Yet no policemen went to gaol whilst Aboriginal over-representation in custody is notorious and disgraceful and has actually increased since the Royal Commission started. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to pay tribute, while I am on this subject, to the Coroner, David McCann, for his courageous and thoughtful actions and stance, which were undoubtedly not in tune with prevailing community attitudes. His charging of the five policemen, in itself, shocked the white community but not only did he charge the police, he also took the highly unusual step of engaging for the prosecution the services of two prominent barristers&mdash;a sign of how seriously he took these charges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1989 Mr McCann made a wide-ranging and thoughtful comment on the whole issue of deaths in custody in Western Australia, in which he canvassed issues such as police attitudes, the inadequacies and frustrations of the coronial system and the general disadvantage of Aboriginal people in the community and in their dealings with the law. He concluded that no right thinking person could claim that the Aborigines were responsible for their own situation. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To do so crudely ignores the history of the displacement of the Aborigines from their historical occupation of the countryside and the devastation visited upon those communities as a result of the introduction of diseases and deleterious substances by the Anglo-Australian immigrants.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the death by hanging of Eddie Murray in the police cells in Wee Waa, I would like to quote from the submission of the National Aboriginal and Islander Services Secretariat&mdash;NAILSS&mdash;to the Royal Commission:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not NAILSS's role in the enquiry to argue with particularity as to whether Eddie Murray committed `suicide', as the police involved have always claimed, or whether he was the victim of an accidental or deliberate killing. It is NAILSS's primary contention that the unbroken line of police power over Eddie Murray whilst living, and over his remains after death, has led to a situation where, in the absence of the intervention of any genuinely independent investigative body, it is now impossible to dispel the very real suspicion that an execution of some sort did occur.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Parliament House Construction Authority Repeal Bill comes before the Parliament because the work of this Authority has been completed&mdash;perhaps some two years or so ago. The building was opened in 1988 on 9 May. The Authority remained in existence after that time to complete certain items and to undertake any minor contractual matters that had not then been resolved. The Minister's second reading speech sets out the fact that the building was completed and opened on 9 May 1988 and sets out the closing of the offices, the termination of the Authority members when they tendered their resignations to the Governor-General, and the removal of the offices of the Authority. It is a quite bland, factual document.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to refer very briefly to other aspects of the Authority, and the fact that it will now officially and legally be going out of existence. It existed for the time of the construction of this building. I think all of us remember with some excitement the time when the design of the building was chosen and the plan made known. Anyone I spoke to who was associated with the selection of the design said that this one almost chose itself, it was so far ahead of any other designs that were presented. As the design and the drawings and the plan models were sent around Australia everybody agreed that it was the right building for this particular site. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For Canberra it was a very important construction. It contributed enormously to our economy over the years with the number of jobs that it provided. Hundreds upon hundreds of people were involved in the construction, and I think particularly of them as the Authority goes out of existence. Still today you will come across people who say with considerable pride, `I worked on the New Parliament House'. I think that is something very worth while, and I think they should be remembered today as we pass this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were union problems on the building, but somehow it still managed to get completed on time. It has always a matter of wonder that it cost a billion dollars. At the time I think most of us thought that that was a pretty large sum, and so it was. It pales into insignificance, though, these days. When you talk about the foreign debt being $145 billion; the $1 billion from this building almost seems to be neither here nor there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The significance of the building, I think, is the statement that Australians have made about their Parliament and about the democratic process. We were prepared to put a lot of money into building a building that recognised the sort of democracy that we are and the sort of country that we want to be. It was perhaps almost ironic that it was opened at the time it was: a time when other countries, such as Poland, were about to get the vote for the first time in 40 years. You will hear people in this country complain about frequent elections, and complain about having to vote. I can hardly believe it when I hear it. So many countries do not ever get a meaningful vote, and yet Australians are so slack about the system that we have and about the stability of our political system that they complain about having the right to have a vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the building will live on and provide for parliamentarians, we are told, for the next 200 years. Few of us will know anything about that. For my part, I find it a magnificent building, one that I enjoy working in and am very proud to be involved in. The only tinge of sadness is that the old Parliament House has been left down there. While it is being looked after, it has not been turned into the constitutional museum that it should be. I think many of us feel somewhat sad that it is being left. There is no doubt that any building that is left will deteriorate. The officers of the Department of Administrative Services are doing their best to look after it in terms of turning taps on and off, flushing toilets, and doing the sort of things that preserve it rather than allowing it to fall into decay. I was there Friday of last week with the members of the Joint Committee who are interested in it, and I have no doubt that the Department is doing its best to look after it. But what a pity it is that that place, that served the country from 1927 until 1988, has not been reopened for people in Australia to see and to understand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, today the Opposition supports the passing of this Bill. One could make a very long speech reviewing the construction of this building but it is all on the public record. I just take this opportunity to salute those who were involved in the design. The names of the architects&mdash;Richard Thorpe and Aldo Giurgola&mdash;will live on in Australia's history. I salute the men and women who worked on the building. We now live in it and use it. Many thousands more than the few politicians who are here work and take part in it as well. The Opposition supports the passage of the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition supports this motion. I spoke on this proposition on 27 February 1992, when the report of the then Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory came into the chamber recommending that the name should be changed. I shall not go through those matters again. It arises, of course, from the fact that the Australian Capital Territory now has its own government and the Federal Government, the Commonwealth Government, is no longer responsible for the whole of the Australian Capital Territory.

There have been many members and senators who have served on this Committee since it came into existence in 1957 and the name change will not really in any way lessen the interests that members of parliament, of course, take in the ACT. Whenever anything comes up, one suddenly finds a couple of hundred experts on the ACT. Sometimes that is good; sometimes it is not good.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support my colleague Senator Reid in supporting this motion currently before the Senate. As Senator Reid has pointed out, the change of the name was brought about to more accurately reflect the role of this Committee. It arises out of a report which was tabled in the Senate some time ago by the Committee. The Committee's responsibility, after the introduction of self-government in the ACT, is not to deal with matters which are properly the matter of the ACT Assembly now, but rather to focus on issues relating to the national significance of Canberra.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee, in the current Parliament, has done a number of inquiries which reflect its interest in Canberra as a national capital. Two of those inquiries have related to the development of the national capital plan; another inquiry has been into aspects of Canberra's national and arterial road system; and another inquiry has been into an amendment to the national capital plan. Currently, the Committee is inquiring into environmental management policies and practices in the national capital. Through its work in this Parliament, the Committee has established itself as the parliamentary guardian of those aspects of Canberra which contribute to its character as the national capital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unfortunate, however, that right around Australia there seems to be an antagonism from all other Australians to Canberra and the Australian Capital Territory and to the public servants and other people who live in this particular area. At a time when Australia is suffering the worst recession in 60 years; at a time when about 1 1/2 million people, on accurate figures, are unemployed, are unable to get full time work or are unable to join the work force and get a reasonable standard of living for their families; at a time when our foreign debt has blown out to over $140 billion, a debt that we will have to pay at some time in the future; at a time when Australians feel helpless and hopeless&mdash;helpless to do anything about it and hopeless about the future; at a time when small towns around our nation are simply closing down, going out of existence, because of the direction this country is going in; at a time when many farmers are working at well below the basic wage and many farmers and farming families are working with negative incomes; at this very difficult time it is reasonable to understand why Australians generally want to blame someone. They look around and they see the Government in Canberra, and so they blame Canberra. They wrongly blame Canberra, in my view. They wrongly blame the public servants and the people who live in Canberra and in the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of my duties in my new role as the shadow Minister for local government and the ACT will be to point out to Canberra's detractors right around Australia that it is not the fault of Canberra, or its inhabitants, or the public servants, that this country is in the mess it is in. It is the fault&mdash;and Australians should be focused on this&mdash;of this Government. This Government of nine years has brought Australia to its knees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians should not be blaming Canberra and the public servants. Australia should be blaming Mr Keating, Mr Dawkins, Mr Willis, Senator Button, Senator Ray, and those people who have controlled this Government in these last years&mdash;those people who have set the directions, who have attempted, very poorly, to manage the country and give directions to the public servants. The ills that we see are not those resulting from Public Service decisions. Public servants simply have to try to administer the rubbish that comes out of the Cabinet room. Complete incompetence has been shown by this Government over the too many years that it has been in power.

The people who live in this fine city are the same as any other Australians: they have their loves and their hates, their happiness and their sorrow. They are no different from anyone else. I often think, when people bash Canberra and public servants, of the people I know down here. Honourable senators have only to look at the people who keep this chamber and this Parliament going, the attendants, the Research Service, those sorts of people we all use and whom we know do a very, very fine job. Those people cannot be blamed for the mess this country is in. They do their job and they do it very, very well. We have to make our fellow Australians aware that most of the people in Canberra are in that category. It is not their fault that this country is in the mess it is in.

What we are going to be doing is changing the mix of Canberra so that a lot more people will be in private enterprise, working in their own business, providing services and goods for Canberra&mdash;as has been done in the past&mdash;but in a different way. </PARA>

In fact, the amendments are matters of substance. They show how poorly drafted the original legislation was; they show how poor was the consultation with the industry, which the industry had complained of. I was drawing to the attention of the Senate the fact that we are aware that the draft legislation was available at the end of last year and yet nobody was consulted about it. It did not see the light of day until it was suddenly introduced into the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pointed out also that, apparently, the Minister had given an undertaking in the early part of last year, particularly to the importers of motor vehicles, that this new electronic lodgment system would be up and running by September of last year. For that reason, when the legislation was not ready&mdash;I can only presume it would be because of ministerial ineptitude&mdash;an agreement was entered into, an agreement which Mr Miller, a legal adviser within the Australian Customs Service, admitted was biased in favour of the Australian Customs Service.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GG4">Senator FOREMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs. In light of yesterday's one per cent drop in official interest rates, can the Minister tell us what the Government expects from credit card providers? Would the Minister comment on reports that the Standing Committee of Consumer Affairs Ministers has agreed to the introduction of fees on credit cards?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2435" SPEAKER="Tate Sen The Hon M.C." NAMEID="NJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="TAS" MINISTERIAL="JUSTICE AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All honourable senators will be aware that yesterday's very good announcement that cash rates would come down to 6 1/2 per cent was in fact the twelfth in a line of reductions in interest rates which have been achieved over a period of two years or so. Back in January 1990, interest rates were at 18 per cent; they are now down to 6 1/2 per cent in the relevant category. That must mean that money available to banks is being made available at much cheaper rates than it was a couple of years ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, as all honourable senators will also know, there has been no similar reduction in credit card rates. In fact, they have dropped perhaps only 1 1/2 or 2 per cent in some instances. Today's editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS>, under the heading `Discredited Cards', commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Banks are paying less and less for the money they use to lend to their customers, yet they have not passed on this saving. If the rates they still charge on these cards do not constitute usury, at the very least they are grossly unfair.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that that is a fair comment by the editorial writer in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS>. The arguments put forward by the banks are clearly unsustainable. They have claimed that bankcards are unprofitable. The common sense question to ask is: why do they keep running them? They obviously do so in order to entice people into their organisations to purchase other credit products. But, of course, they are profitable, as revealed by the Martin Committee, where Westpac said that they were marginally profitable. I think one other major bank said that it was breaking even. They never mention merchants' fees in all these discussions. So there is plenty of scope, as the Treasurer said yesterday, for a reduction in credit card rates. That significant fall should occur very quickly, as the Advance Bank has shown it is possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consumer affairs Ministers met last week and indicated that it was possible that the banks might be permitted, under State legislation&mdash;it is not a Commonwealth matter&mdash;to charge an annual fee in relation to credit cards, so long as that capacity to charge an annual fee was completely, totally and utterly offset by a reduction in interest rates. That would be the quid pro quo&mdash;and it would need to be sustained over a period of three years. Unless the consumer affairs Ministers get a cast iron guarantee of that offset, there would be no changing of State legislation to permit the charging of an annual fee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that there is an equity argument that at the moment, since those who can afford to do so pay off their bankcard within the interest free period, the people who, by definition, are less well off are left paying a much higher interest charge in order to cover the cost of the bankcard schemes. So there is an argument that every user of a credit card should pay some fee per year and enable interest rates to be brought down. But, unless over the next few days the banks show good faith by responding to the marketplace signals&mdash;the twelfth reduction in interest rates that has occurred in just over two years; down to 6 1/2 per cent from 18 per cent&mdash;I am afraid the consumer affairs Ministers can have no faith in any guarantees that the banks might give for a complete offset for an annual fee for lower interest rates.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, we are not going down the New Zealand road to a cheap labour country and a cheap wages country. Successful economies in this world are high skill economies, high productivity economies and, as well, high wage economies. That is our model and that is our choice for Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that John Howard is boasting around the corridors and to journalists that he has done over Dr Hewson on industrial relations and on wages policy and that his version of industrial relations will apply. I have to say to that cheap jibe by my shadow that, while Dr Hewson has a doctrinaire and theoretical understanding based on his `dry' economic perspective and John Howard has a glib political understanding, whichever presentational gloss they put on it, the primary core proposition is still the same as the New Zealand one, low wages and exploitation, and the bottom line is a poor economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question is about the Queensland Liberal leader, Ms Joan Sheldon. As I understand it, she was speaking on ABC radio in Brisbane this morning and answering questions about the Women's Electoral Lobby survey on supermarket prices under the consumption tax package. I think that what she said to the interviewer was very revealing:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you are going to widen the debate, and if you are going to put time into it, then put a balanced representation. Put the time into it, but be honest and say well we've done this whole survey, we've taken into consideration the abolition of payroll tax, fuel excise&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I might say at this point that the debate is very familiar from the Opposition. Then she absolutely let the wages cat out of the bag when she went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the fact that the wages of the people who work in all these institutions are going to drop by 30%&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I should quote that again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the fact that the wages of the people who work in all these institutions are going to drop by 30%&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>She then said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">we've done all this and this is what we've finally come up with that some articles, yes, will as the Coalition said go up about 4 %, others indeed will drop. That's the truthful message and let's at least be honest about this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am glad that the Liberal leader in Queensland is being honest about it. I am glad that at last she has confirmed all the things that we have said about the Liberal Party's Fightback package, which is after all a package imposing a 15 per cent flat consumption tax, compensation for the rich and a 30 per cent reduction for wage and salary earners in Australia. Those are the words of the leader of the Queensland Liberal Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over recent days we have heard the theory of the big bang. The big bang theory suggests that one can implement overnight all the changes that the Opposition wishes to make. I suggest that the big bang will blow up in the Opposition's face if ever it gets a chance to impose its wages policy. The problem will be, however, that it will blow up in Australia's face as well and send the economy spinning into division, low wages and the Third World. That is the outcome of the Opposition's industrial relations policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The latest figures from New Zealand in an analysis of the first 190 employment contracts by the New Zealand Department of Labour show that over half of the employees covered under such contracts had their wages frozen or reduced. That is the outcome of the survey. The picture is actually worse than that suggests because the statistics cover only companies with more than 20 employees. Those with less than 20 employees are not covered by that survey, and on anecdotal evidence one has good reason to believe that wage cuts have been more savage in that sector than elsewhere.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce. Is the Minister aware that the No. 1 recommendation of the task force on the commercialisation of research was that the research and development tax concessions should remain at 150 per cent, contrary to government policy of reducing the concession to 125 per cent?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware that that was the No. 1 recommendation of the Block report. The Government certainly had to take that into account earlier this year. The tax concession was put there because of chronic failure in the private sector research and development effort throughout the 1970s. Australia has always been quite well up with other overseas countries in respect of public sector research but poor in private sector research. As a result of the introduction of the 150 per cent tax concession for research and development&mdash;I think it came in in 1986&mdash;private sector research and development performance in Australia has increased significantly. I think it is fair to say that it has doubled. That is a better performance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we said about the level of the tax concession in February was that the 125 per cent which would come in in July 1993 would remain a permanent feature of the taxation incentive landscape, whereas the 150 per cent concession was always open to considerable discussion and so on. I think that, in terms of government appropriations in support of research, we have done very well in recent years in public sector research. The tax incentive for the private sector will remain, albeit at a lower level. The balance of that is probably fairly right. These are matters to which there has to be a flexible response to the international situation. That is something which the Government has in mind on a continuing basis.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday Senator Jones mentioned to me his concern about the possibility of a major outbreak of this particularly virulent strain of influenza this winter in Australia, particularly the strain known as A-Beijing strain. There is no doubt that some concern in the community has led to an increased demand for that particularly potent vaccine to be available against that very virulent strain of influenza. In anticipation of the higher than normal demand, the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories and Pasteur Merieux have produced approximately 1.5 to 1.6 million doses of flu vaccine for distribution in 1992.

A further allocation of $3.4m has been made to facilitate a range of projects at 12 hospitals and medical centres in South Australia. Under matching arrangements, South Australia will contribute a further $1.7m to these programs which, I think, involve the provision of X-ray machines for Flinders Medical Centre, ultrasound facilities at Murray Bridge, scanners at Queen Elizabeth Hospital and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These allocations are consistent with the hospital enhancement program under which the States and Territories identify target areas where gaps and deficiencies exist in clinical services and/or capital equipment in major hospitals, and make specific proposals for remedial action. The program was never designed to specifically address waiting lists. Although States are able to direct their allocation towards clinical services, most States have elected to use the funds for equipment and apparently that is what has happened in South Australia.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the full development of phased array, not only does this option become cheaper but it does so with the same technological achievement or better. It would be foolish to rush in today to try to purchase the old technology when the new technology is just around the corner. That is in terms of not only the technology itself but also the platform that one puts it on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second criticism related to the temperature inside the light armoured vehicle. It is acknowledged that that is substantially high because the vehicles currently in the north of Australia are there for test purposes. If the members of that Committee had followed Estimates committee hearings and Senator MacGibbon's questions in detail, they would have realised that climate control will go into the next 100 of those vehicles; not air conditioning, because we want the temperature inside to be exactly the same as that outside for when the troops leave the vehicle. So when the next 100 vehicles are purchased they will have climate control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Incidentally, I might add that the Leopard tanks cannot be so assisted, which is a pity; but we will put in water cooling methods that will at least mean the drinking water is at a proper temperature rather than the very high temperature at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third issue raised was the Chinooks. Before I became Minister it was a decision of Government to retire the Chinooks from service. On becoming Minister I have had this issue looked at and, in the context of the Gulf war, there was interest from the United States in using some of our Chinooks. We have made arrangements with the United States that we will trade in our 11 Chinooks and in return get four upgraded models.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The advantage, of course, of the upgraded models is far less cost on maintenance and far higher performance. The only caveat I would put on that is that this agreement has to be ratified by Congress. But it has been agreed right up to that point at the moment, and I discussed it with Secretary Cheney earlier this week and he sees no great impediment to that going through Congress. So we will have four Chinooks added to the fleet and operational.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is aware of proposals to close down the AGPS but they are not proposals that we would endorse or accept. As it happens, the AGPS is included in the list of businesses that Dr Hewson would commercialise in his first year and contract out in his second year. As a consequence of this initiative, he claims he could save $16m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One reason why the Government will not accept this sort of policy proposal is that we do not believe that those savings are there to be made. To confirm our position, we look of course to the experience in New South Wales where, in July 1989, the Greiner Government closed the New South Wales Government Printing Office. Staff were retrenched and the assets were sold off. This decision was taken for purely ideological reasons and was driven by the wholesale policy of privatisation that the Greiner Government had in place. It was extolled as one of the centrepieces of that policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two things happened as a consequence of that, and for these two reasons also the Government will not embrace this sort of initiative. Almost immediately it was impossible to get up to date <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansards</EMPHASIS> and new legislation. As a consequence, the Greiner Government attracted wholesale criticism from the legal community, libraries and the courts. That in itself was bad enough, but the Government very soon realised that its policy initiative, ideologically driven, as I have said, was not working.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within eight months of the New South Wales Government closing down the government printer, it has now established a new Government Printing Service. It has kept it a well guarded secret&mdash;and obviously Dr Hewson does not know about it because, if he did, he would not be claiming savings for this sort of initiative. It is also clear that the Greiner Government has not talked about it. It still wants to maintain the illusion of its privatisation ideology. But the new Government Printing Service in New South Wales has taken over most of the functions of the old Government Printing Office. Even the name is almost identical.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For at least Senator Childs, who has taken an interest in this matter, I quote what the GPS claims it can provide to its clients in New South Wales. In doing so, I will show that what it can now provide is what the old Government Printing Office provided in the past:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government Printing Service provides and facilitates printing for NSW Government organisations. Its services include print procurement, provision of desktop publishing hardware and software systems and support services, production of camera-ready artwork for a number of government publications, and reproduction and binding services offered through 25 Document Reproduction Centres throughout the State.</PARA>
<PARA>So the New South Wales experience is very clear. It claims savings to prop up its ideologically driven policy initiative. Those savings were not there. In the dark, in private, it has now reinstituted a government printing office. It has been a failed experiment in New South Wales. It is quite apparent why Mr Greiner does not talk about it because, as a failed experiment, it has cost the New South Wales taxpayer a lot of money&mdash;and I would like to know how much this experiment has cost. Given that experience in New South Wales, I think two things will or should happen at a Federal level: firstly, that we will not embrace that policy; and, secondly, that Dr Hewson should once again go back to his Fightback package and revise it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Administrative Services.

Is it a fact that not all Tasmanian motor vehicle licence requirements are observed by the Department? Is it a fact that the Department is exempt from wholesale sales tax, fuel excise, payroll tax and local government rates in relation to its operation in Tasmania? While the Tasmanian manager of the Department of Administrative Services rightly claims that his charges are competitive, he fails to acknowledge the tremendous commercial advantage his Department has over any competitor who incurs all of those additional costs and taxes. Is this a description of the Labor Party's level playing field for competition between government business enterprises and private enterprises?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is one clear distinction, among many, between the Government and the Opposition; that is, that this Government has some faith in the public sector. I make that point because over recent weeks we have seen a litany of abuse from those opposite&mdash;and, of course, their Fightback package is based very much on an attack on the public sector and cutbacks in that area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Stemming from the Government's belief in the public sector is the fact that the Department of Administrative Services has been restructuring the public sector within the Department to ensure that services can be provided on a cost competitive basis. By the end of this coming financial year, 90 per cent of the services provided by the Department will be untied to other government departments. That means that government departments, in deciding where to go for the provision of services, can choose us or the private sector as an alternative. Obviously to gear up for that the Department has to become competitive. To do that a number of initiatives have been taken, including a total restructuring, a cutback in the work force and a cutback in overheads.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that process we are finding that we do have excess capacity. To become commercial and cost competitive, we can also tender for incidental work outside the work that we provide for the public sector. It can only be incidental work because the Constitution does not allow us to do more than that. I reject totally Senator Walters's point that we have an unfair advantage when tendering for that work. There are some areas where the Department of Administrative Services does not pay the costs that contractors in the private sector would pay. This is true in respect of some items that Senator Walters mentioned, such as fuel and equipment and sales taxes. At the same time, a public sector utility is obliged to meet a whole raft of costs.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time as having those advantages, the public sector has to meet a whole raft of costs. For instance, in the transport and storage area, unlike our competitors, something like 95 per cent of our work force is full time. We pay higher superannuation; we meet obligations of training guarantees; we have higher property costs based on highest and best use valuation; we adhere to award wages, which is very important when we compare ourselves, for instance, with others on the supply of transport to the government sector; and we have higher salaries, oncosts and corporate overheads. We also have the obligation of servicing Ministers and being accountable to the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been estimated that these cost disadvantages amount to at least 5 to 10 per cent of distribution and operating costs. When one compares that with those taxes that we do not have to pay which Senator Walters mentioned, one finds that the costs of those other things that we have to meet exceed those advantages. Basically, the bottom is that the obligations we have as a public sector utility far outweigh the so-called advantage we have by not paying some of those taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My final point is that I and the Government believe that public sector utilities can be made to work efficiently and productively. I am not going to tell these departments that they should close up shop. We have faith in them. We will make sure that they operate on a commercial basis. To the extent that they do, they will survive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Newman talks about too many chiefs. That is a most irrelevant and inane comment in respect of this issue. In respect of the TSG winning a contract for the Westpac bank in Tasmania, a private sector organisation, there is no question of whether we have too many chiefs. The basic point is that we have obligations to meet. We have some advantages in terms of things that we do not have to meet, but at the end of the day the bottom line is that we have to meet more than we do not have to meet.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In so far as Senator Coulter's reference to Fightback is concerned, I am not quite clear about the relationship between the two things. All I understand about Fightback is that additional taxes will be imposed on Australian people in respect of their purchases of food and clothing and essentials of life, and that those taxes will be detrimental to the average Australian household. If we improve the livability of people in cities, we are increasing public sector good and depriving them of private sector good in terms of their household expenditure. I understand that to be the relevant point Senator Coulter is trying to make.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is not in the business of controlling shipping freight rates or the frequency of shipping services. The reason I make that point is that when one looks at a lot of the rhetoric that is delivered, particularly by the Opposition, one would think that it is the Government's business to run the commercial affairs of private companies. As I have said before, the question of negotiating freight rates and getting cheaper freight rates is essentially a matter for commercial negotiation between the shippers and the providers of the shipping services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government, however, does seek to provide a fair, competitive environment in which these negotiations can take place between shippers and the cartels of shipowners operating in specific trades, which are known as shipping conferences. This approach is reflected in part 10 of the Australian Trade Practices Act. This empowers shippers acting through their peak organisations to require shipping conferences and non-conference carriers with substantial market power to negotiate service arrangements and terms and conditions of carriage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to this legislation, which came into full effect in 1990, major exporters formed the Australian Peak Shippers Association which represents shippers of over 80 per cent by volume of liner cargo exports. In the short time that this organisation has been operating it has become an extremely effective organisation on behalf of the people it represents. The Association is extremely active and has already achieved very significant benefits for Australian exporters in negotiations with the shipping conferences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge shippers to join the Association and to invest some of their time and effort in strengthening its capacity to represent Australian export interests.

A South Australian group of shippers has registered with the Trade Practices Commission an agreement with the Australian, New Zealand and Europe Container Services&mdash;or ANZECS, which is a shipping conference. It has achieved a contract with that shipping conference for freight rates which includes a specific contractual clause requiring that any savings in port costs, as a result of reductions in stevedoring rates or port charges, obtained by the shipping conference must be passed on directly to the shippers. This agreement may provide a guide for other shippers and their peak organisations in pursuing this matter in negotiation with shipping companies and conferences.</PARA></TALK.START>

Subsequently, a $415,000 project to establish a geographic information system was devised to help plan for the return of dislocated people to their lands, and to develop a strategy for dealing with the recurrent problem of lahar flows from the volcano's slopes over the next few years.</PARA>

<PARA>I just thought the Senate might be interested in knowing of the apparently dishonest way in which the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) represented the matters concerning Mrs Sheldon in the Senate today. Certainly, Mrs Sheldon acknowledges that she made a slip in her statement on the radio.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is also fascinating, as the interjector reminds me, that when we asked aNiMaLS for a transcript it said, `You can have it, but you can have it after Question Time'. One wonders the purpose of the taxpayers' money in running this operation if that is its function. If the Minister had read the transcript, he would have seen from Mrs Sheldon's answer that there is no other way in which it could reasonably be interpreted other than that she was talking about the taxation reductions that would occur under Fightback. She leads into it by talking about the reductions in payroll tax, the reductions in fuel excise and other reductions which are going to result in a 30 per cent drop. Nothing else makes sense but a 30 per cent drop in taxation. Did the Minister make that clear when he answered the question? No. He wanted us to believe that she deliberately intended that wages were going to drop when no reasonable interpretation could be made to that effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worse because Mrs Sheldon put out a press release before Question Time earlier this morning clarifying the position and setting it straight so that the whole world knew. If aNiMaLS picked up her conversation, I have no doubt it picked up a publicly released press release. I therefore have little doubt that the Minister has that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Will the honourable senator just sit still and listen to the explanation. It is about cutting programs funded by my Department which are aimed at assisting labour market adjustment and helping people transfer into the post-tariff environment. Therefore, all we know from the Fightback package&mdash;the consumption tax package&mdash;is that the policy prescriptions of that package on industrial relations are relatively silent. Therefore, we must move to the statements made by various of the responsible spokespersons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most recent statement was made by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) in a set piece speech to an audience in Auckland, New Zealand, in which he bagged, as it turns out wrongfully and dishonestly, the productivity performances of Australian workers and praised, as it turns out wrongfully and dishonestly, the productivity performance of New Zealand under its new frightening industrial relations scenario. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know from what has been said in that speech and what is said from time to time by my shadow, Mr Howard, that the Opposition's industrial relations policy is aimed at removing the Industrial Relations Commission as the central determinant of awards, ending a national wage case, making war on trade unions and ending the award system. We know all those things. We know as well that that apes and copies the New Zealand system, which is a low wage scenario. It is entirely consistent, logical and proper that the conclusion we draw from that is consistent with the remarks which have now apparently&mdash;on Senator Hill's word&mdash;been withdrawn by this person, Mrs Sheldon, the Leader of the Liberal Party in Queensland. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to speak briefly to Senator Hill's motion regarding an answer that was given by Senator Cook. Senator Cook would know from reading the document&mdash;as would Senator Reynolds who asked the question and who is now smiling; she is too smart by half&mdash;that the answer given by Mrs Sheldon had no relationship whatsoever with the industrial relations policy. The abolition of a whole range of taxes, whether it be payroll tax, fuel excise and so on, also relates to the tax on income. Everyone knows that under the Fightback package, 95 per cent of Australians will be paying 30 per cent or less in tax. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) knows that. He also knows that what he said had no relevance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that, yet again, the Australian Labor Party is engaging in diversionary tactics. Senator Reynolds asked a question during Question Time today. Senator Cook refused to table the transcript. Do honourable senators know why he would not do so? It is because the National Media Liaison Service would appear across the top of the transcript. That is where it would have come from. It would have come from the propaganda arm of the Government. This body, which sits in Brisbane, is supposed to disseminate Government information. But that is not its job. Its job is to pick up remarks made during talkback programs by members of State Liberal Oppositions or State Liberal Governments and transmit them here lickety-spit so that members of the Government can get up and have a bit of fun. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, this is a diversion. The Labor Party is pretty cranky with Mrs Sheldon. This morning in the Queensland State Parliament, Mrs Sheldon caught out the super clean Mr Goss. Is Senator Reynolds aware of that? Of course she is. She introduced this as a diversion. This morning Mrs Sheldon asked Mr Goss:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Did Commissioner Newnham&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>who, as honourable senators know, has been subject to some charge&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ever raise with the Premier the possibility of illegal donations being made to a Labor member of parliament or to the Labor Party?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Goss answered, `No'. She followed up that question by asking:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is it a fact that Commissioner Newnham forwarded directly to you a copy of a Federal Police transcript of a telephone conversation in which a $5,000 bribe was discussed by the former disgraced Police Minister, the member for Chatsworth, with another person under Federal Police investigation. Is it a fact that following this advice from Commissioner Newnham, arrangements were made for the $5,000 to be listed as a legal donation to the Australian Labor Party?</PARA>
<PARA>Guess what Mr Goss then replied? He waffled on for 20 minutes. This is why Senator Reynolds or the aNiMaLS say, `Let's divert attention away from this scandal that has been coming out in Queensland'. The Minister gave a long-winded answer during which he said, `Well, the reason I said no the first time was because it was not illegal. I actually went to see Sir Max Bingham and he indicated that, as it was a donation to the Labor Party, it was not illegal'. There are a lot of unanswered questions about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A legitimate question was asked and a misleading answer was given by this guy who calls himself Premier Goss.

The National Media Liaison Service, which we all know can get out a transcript in a very short period, would have got out that transcript and sent it to the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook). The Minister went and gave it to Senator Reynolds who, I am ashamed to say, took part in this deception. I would have thought that Senator Reynolds was beyond that sort of thing.

When he sits there and shakes his head and says that NMLS did not supply him with Mrs Sheldon's press release, nobody who has listened to the debates in this chamber would believe his denial. When he was handed this document by Senator Hill, he even stood up and said that it was undated. Anybody with half a brain can see the date written right across the top of it. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are addressing the issue of a motion to take note of the answer by Senator Cook in Question Time today. Senator Reynolds may say that her motivation for raising this matter resulted from her having received telephone calls from the good citizens of Queensland. But she did not deny in any way that those good citizens of Queensland who phoned her were, in effect, the staff of aNiMaLS in Queensland who got these faxes down here to her, Senator Cook or to other agents of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not surprising that the corrected replacement transcript that Senator Cook tabled in this chamber five minutes ago has been delivered to this Senate chamber by the Minister through his agencies in whatever way aNiMaLS has put it down before the copy requested by my colleague Senator Newman was delivered. When the question was asked about an hour and a half ago in Question Time she immediately requested a copy from aNiMaLS. It still has not arrived on this side of the chamber, but aNiMaLS can find the time and motives and the place to get the corrected copy to Senator Cook and to have him table it in this chamber. What a disgrace! Those opposite talk about indignation and claim to represent the good citizens of Queensland. Labor senators talk about economic refugees from New Zealand. I would point out to them that there are many economic refugees from Victoria now in Queensland because of the Labor Party's policies in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA>I will not keep the Senate long on this matter, but there are several points that need to be on the record in light of Senator Evans's dismissive answer that he would not inquire of either the Australian Embassy or the Australian consulates in the United States as to any possible dealings between Senator Richardson and Mr Symons, Senator Richardson's friend. He said that he would only investigate it if I gave him some good reason to do so. </PARA>

Again and again on this side of the Parliament we asked him to investigate the nature of the carryings on of Brian Burke in Ireland. Again and again he refused to carry out any inquiry whatsoever. When we saw what has come out of the royal commission in Western Australia, we discovered that had Senator Evans done what he ought to have done and inquired about his Ambassador in Ireland, the Commonwealth may have been saved some money in telephone calls, in the illegal purchasing and shipping of cars or in a whole range of other things that are being disclosed.

I would like Senator Evans to give this Senate an undertaking that he will not shirk his responsibility and say, `Ha, ha, ha, I'm not going to do it anyway', which was his action, but to say that he will make a serious inquiry as to whether or not the information that has come to me and to other people is sustainable and that there have been dealings by Senator Richardson with the Australian Embassy and/or consulates in the United States.

No question of public affairs arises on the face of such contacts being made.

<PARA>We rarely move censure motions in this place. We regard them as being of a most serious nature. We move one only when we believe there is clear evidence of a breach of ministerial responsibility. We in turn have a responsibility in this place, and that is to do our best to keep Ministers honest. We expect them to tell the truth to this chamber, not to misrepresent things to this chamber. We expect them not to interfere in the justice system of other countries, and not to use their political weight or influence to affect outcomes in the judicial systems of other countries. If the Government is going to set down standards of disclosure which are designed to avoid conflicts of interest or to enable the public to recognise when a conflict of interest occurs, then we expect Ministers to abide by those standards&mdash;to meet the standards that the Government claims publicly it expects of them. In all three instances in this case the Minister is guilty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first allegation that we make relates to Senator Richardson's deliberately misleading the Senate in relation to the business affairs of Mr Greg Symons, a person we now know to be a close friend of the Minister. It might be recalled that it appeared that, in a newspaper report of 28 April, the Minister claimed to have no knowledge of the business affairs of Mr Symons. As a result of that, he was asked a specific question in this chamber by my colleague Senator Kemp. He was asked what knowledge he had of the business affairs of Mr Symons and in answer to that&mdash;this was on 29 April 1992&mdash;he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat the statement that I have no knowledge of his business affairs.</PARA>
<PARA>That was not qualified in any way&mdash;`I have no knowledge'. This was at a time when he was seeking to distance himself from Mr Symons&mdash;somebody who was then, of course, hardly known to the Minister!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kemp was not to be put off, but he was somewhat surprised, because we had all heard of a letter of introduction that had apparently been written. At that time the Minister was unable to find a copy of that letter of introduction&mdash;and I think he still claims to be unable to find such a letter. Senator Kemp pursued the matter by putting to the Minister that he had said in the letter of introduction that he had such knowledge. The Minister then reiterated the point he had earlier made to Senator Kemp. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I made the point that I have no knowledge of that business and I repeat it now.</PARA>
<PARA>So twice in answer to Senator Kemp on that day he said specifically that he had no knowledge of the business affairs of Mr Symons&mdash;and we were not going to learn any more. If further information had not been received, we would not have known any more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, today when he was asked about an incredible occurrence, when Mr Symons and Mr Finch&mdash;who, I understand, is a lawyer and is also involved in these Marshall Islands matters&mdash;supposedly came to Canberra to see the Minister on 12 November 1991. Apparently they intended to come here with a representative of the National Bank of&mdash;guess where&mdash;the Marshall Islands. Bear in mind that this is in circumstances where the Minister has said that he has no knowledge of any business affairs. Why would these three gentlemen be seeking to see the then Minister for Social Security in his Canberra office? What business would they be having with the Australian Government? What business would they be having with one of the most senior Cabinet Ministers of this Government&mdash;a Cabinet Minister who we know has some special influence in this Government?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Richardson told us today that the banker did not turn up on time, so he did not see the banker. But the other two turned up; he saw the other two. What was he seeing them about? Today Senator Richardson told us:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, I did know that they had a scheme going, which was a business migration scheme.</PARA>
<PARA>Why did he not tell the Senate on 29 April that he knew that they were involved in a business migration scheme? On 29 April he said that he had no knowledge of what business Mr Symons was engaged in. Is that not as clear a breach of that ministerial standard not to mislead the Senate as one could ever find? But, if it could be made worse, it was made worse when the letter that Senator Richardson has lost&mdash;the personal reference&mdash;was tabled in the chamber, again by my colleague Senator Kemp. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The letter that was tabled indicates that Senator Richardson in fact knows quite a lot about the business background of Mr Symons. I will quote a few paragraphs from it. He talked about Mr Symons's career background in government and subsequently in commerce. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Symons . . . has been an Adviser to major corporations and Government Authorities in Australia and overseas.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Richardson said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Symons has extensive experience in trade development and export of technology and educational services in the Asia Pacific region.</PARA>
<PARA>He even gets down to dates:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1989/90, Mr Symons successfully negotiated the sale to the Peoples Republic of China of a large steel mill facility and related technology from BHP Steel in Australia and co-ordinated the dismantling and shipping process.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the person about whose business background Senator Richardson was telling the Senate he knew nothing. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the past two years Mr Symons has worked closely with a number of Australian universities including the University of Southern Queensland on development overseas of a University Studies Centre course known as Unipac International to train Asian students and accredit them for onward entry into higher education in Australia, New Zealand, USA and Europe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Concurrent with his work on export of educational services, Mr Symons has promoted the export of Australian technology and research services and associated information data base services offered by various Australian universities.</PARA>
<PARA>It would seem from that letter that Senator Richardson, not surprisingly, has a quite comprehensive knowledge of the business background of Mr Symons. How else could that be interpreted?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we hear today is an acknowledgment by the Minister that these two gentlemen, Symons and Finch, came to see him in Canberra, and an acknowledgment that he knew that they had some business relationship in business migration. We have on the table&mdash;it is public knowledge now&mdash;all this detail by the Minister on the personal and professional background of Mr Symons. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought that anyone looking objectively at that set of circumstances of what the Minister said to the Senate, and the facts that are now on the table, could come to no other conclusion than that Senator Richardson was deliberately misleading the Senate. He wanted the Senate to believe that he knew nothing at all of the business background of Mr Symons. Why did he not want us to know that? Because, of course, the matter is now very embarrassing. Mr Symons happens to have been arrested in the Marshall Islands and is facing serious charges, so it is not surprising that the Minister would seek to dissociate himself from it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That links me to the second allegation that we make against the Minister. He acted, I would have thought, in an unprecedented way&mdash;certainly an improper way&mdash;by contacting the President of the Marshall Islands to ask that some special favour be done for his friend Mr Symons&mdash;in this instance, the return of his passport. This is not any Australian just contacting any official to check up on the circumstances of a particular matter that is before the courts. This is a most senior Minister in the Australian Government contacting the head of state of the country in which his friend is being charged to ask this special favour. Is that proper behaviour? I would have thought again, by any objective standard, that that is clearly improper and the Minister, I suspect, knows of the impropriety as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How do I know that? Because, again, he sought to mislead the public and the Senate as to the circumstances of that telephone call.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no good for Senator Richardson to come in here and say that that was not his intention. The question was: how would it be interpreted in the Marshall Islands? The way I have just put it to him is, in fact, how it was interpreted. We now have evidence of the interviews of the Attorney-General of the Marshall Islands, Mr McPhillips. We now know what he told the court when this matter came up for hearing in the Marshall Islands. What came up in the hearing was the fact that Senator Richardson had given this personal introduction for the man who was on the charge. The Attorney-General of the Marshall Islands said, `It is my understanding this particular Minister is one of the most powerful Ministers in the Australian Government. He wields great power. Not just another Minister, not an Opposition Party member, but part of the Government'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Attorney-General went on to make it clear that the person who was involving himself in this process by contacting the head of state wielded great influence in the Australian Government and that, clearly, he was making that contact for no other purpose than to use his status&mdash;his stature as a Minister of the Crown in this Government&mdash;to seek advantage for his friend in the Marshall Islands. We regard that as a serious charge and we regard that as improper behaviour by a Minister of the Crown. That Senator Evans gave him permission to do such a thing only indicts Senator Evans in this entirely unsatisfactory matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third allegation we bring to complete the package of the sorry events of this last week of the behaviour of the Minister is that which concerns his directorship of the radio station in Newcastle.

Where they have a conflict&mdash;actual or potential&mdash;of interest, the Australian public will now know'. Did Senator Richardson take any notice of that obligation? Did he meet the responsibilities that his then Prime Minister set out for his Ministers? No, he disregarded it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He became a director of this company two years before it has become public. Did he disclose it? On no occasion. Did he disclose it to his ministerial colleagues in Cabinet deliberations when they were dealing with media matters&mdash;matters that could affect the well-being of that particular company? No, he had no interest in doing that either. Not only did he not disclose it to his colleagues, he also did not disclose it to the public. He continued to deliberate upon media matters and took no notice of the ministerial responsibility that he had been set. When he was forced to face up to it in this chamber, he sought to wriggle out by saying, `Well, it didn't relate to a pecuniary interest'. The statement of interest is not just for pecuniary interest, it is for registrable interest&mdash;situations where there could be a conflict of interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand it, this radio station is owned by the Labor Party. The Minister has an interest in promoting the interests of that radio station for the benefit of his political party. He clearly had an interest, on behalf of the company of which he was a director, in all debates in the chamber here, in the Caucus and in the Cabinet that affected the financial and other well-being of that company. At no time did he disclose that interest which was blatantly in breach of the obligations that the then Prime Minister had set for him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a sorry tale that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), when he had to face up to that this week, instead of taking some disciplinary action against Senator Richardson, said, `He is my mate. He has apologised. I accept the apology. I am going to do nothing further'. What does that demonstrate to the Australian people about the standards of the Prime Minister? It demonstrates that the standards of the Prime Minister are, in fact, no higher than those of the Minister and that we can disregard this whole process of ministerial disclosure and the protection it claims to offer the Australian public in situations of conflict of interest. On the third offence Senator Richardson has more or less admitted he is a liability. He is guilty of that and he should be censured by this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He should be censured on all three counts here today: firstly, of deliberately misleading the Senate over the affairs of Mr Symons and the knowledge of the business affairs of Mr Symons&mdash;I must say, in passing, that that matter has not yet ended, but that is where we are on the table today; secondly, the improper interference in the judicial system in the Marshall Islands; and thirdly, the matter that concerned the radio station. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Richardson should be censured on all three counts. In particular, I say to the Australian Democrats that they now have another opportunity to demonstrate to the Australian people whether they are going to uphold proper standards. If they are to demand proper standards from Ministers in this place, then he should clearly be censured by this Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will try to deal with the three matters raised by Senator Hill. The first is this question of my knowledge of the business affairs of Mr Symons and, in particular, of the Marshall Islands scheme. I repeat what I said in the Senate on two other occasions: I do not have any knowledge of it. I know that a scheme exists. I do not know anyone to whom Mr Symons may have spoken or dealt with in the Marshall Islands. I know that he went to the United States and spoke to officials there. I do not know to whom he spoke. I do not know the topics of the conversation. I do not know any of those details at all. I wonder how it can be said that I have misled the Senate by saying just that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the last few days questions have been asked repeatedly about the amount of money that might have been given to Mr Symons or his companies by the Australian Government. In order to give honourable senators an opportunity to get a feel for how much I know of his business affairs, I could not in my wildest dreams give a list of the companies for the Government to check. I have no idea what companies Mr Symons might be involved in, nor the scope and breadth of their business activity. I do not understand why I would have. There is no reason whatsoever that I would have any of that knowledge. I have not sought at any time to find out, and I do not need to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can make another admission&mdash;if that is what Senator Hill wants to call it. I spoke to Mr Symons at my aunt's funeral two days before he was arrested and the day before he left Australia. He was back from the Marshall Islands. He told me everything was going well in his business and I wished him well. Again, it does not mean that I know anything about his business affairs. I have probably seen him once a month over the last year on family occasions, obviously. There is no secret about whether I have been to see him; I obviously have. To try to read into that situation that I have knowledge of his business affairs is just ridiculous. </PARA>

They ring in and give me the benefit of their knowledge.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one has even suggested that I have had meetings with anyone concerned with this scheme. If I was as involved and had the knowledge that has been suggested, then I would have been at a lot more meetings than one 10-minute meeting in Parliament House last year. The thought that in that 10 minutes I could have had conveyed to me some great knowledge of what was going on is nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All that happened was that I was told there was a scheme.

When I said that I had no knowledge of his business affairs I meant it. I am unable to assist any relevant Minister in a search of any relevant departmental record to find out whether any company associated with Mr Symons ever received money, because I do not know what companies there are.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come to the call to the Marshall Islands. As Senator Evans confirmed the other day, I did ring him before I made the call. I told him what the call would be about. He said that provided the call was about that I was not doing anything improper. I would not have made the call had he suggested that to make it would have been improper. I was absolutely definite in ringing him, because I knew that when calling a foreign government I was not doing something that occurred every day. I wanted to make sure that no protocol was being breached and that I was not doing anything that was prohibited. He confirmed that to make the call on the basis that I said I would make it would create no difficulty for me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have forgotten to address one other point raised by Senator Hill, which concerned a press conference in Melbourne. This was given outside the ATAC conference of a telecommunications users group. I was supposed to be answering questions on telecommunications&mdash;fortunately, I was asked a few&mdash;but a couple of journalists sought to ask questions about this matter. I did not intend to make that press conference the be-all and end-all of my comments on the matter. I had in fact already contacted my office at the time and a statement was being prepared which, because it referred to Senator Evans, I wanted him to check. I did not intend to make any further detailed comment until that statement was released. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I said that I had made a call to the island. I said that I had spoken to an administration official. That, of course, was true. Then, by the time I arrived back in Canberra 45 minutes later, we released a statement in the Press Gallery&mdash;and, therefore, it came into the possession of all senators&mdash;which set out exactly what I had done. So at no stage did I  mislead the press, let alone mislead the Senate. I was direct in every respect in explaining exactly when I called, whom I called and what I said. So, for all of that, I cannot see where there is anything at all that I have done wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the comments made by the Attorney-General of the Marshall Islands, I know that Senator Evans had something to say about that at a doorstop this morning. The Attorney-General was at that time asking for bail of $1 1/2m or something and it was set at a few thousand. So I do not think he had quite the effect that he wanted to have anyway. All I can say in relation to his comments is this: I cannot have, by virtue of any public or private capacity, any absolute influence on whether or not, if he were to get bail and return to Australia, he would ever go back. I do not have the power to make him go; I do not have the power to make him stay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is beyond me completely what the Attorney-General was getting at. He has taken a particularly hard line on the matter, which is his right. So, no doubt his rhetoric will be directed towards achieving his ends&mdash;as is the rhetoric that is being used here today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My statements here in the Senate have been completely clean. I have not attempted to colour in any way what the relationship is. I fully understand that, as court cases take place over the course of the next 12 months, every detail of whatever this scheme is will come out. So there is no point in trying to be clever about it. The simple fact is, though, that because I do not know details of it, I cannot give details to the Senate; and because I do not know details of it, I think it is reasonable to claim that I do not have any knowledge of his business affairs, and that is what I claim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know what one can say about the 2HD matter. It is quite clear from the checks of the Cabinet minutes that I did not contribute to any debate that had anything remotely to do with radio. Unfortunately, Cabinet records do not make it clear on every occasion when Ministers are in the room. That kind of record is not kept. But certainly I did not contribute to any debate. In any event, I do not actually recall being in the room for any of them. I was not in Canberra for the only two debates in which anyone could claim that there was direct benefit to 2HD involved&mdash;of course, that was the matter of a licence fee reduction. So the fact that I was not here at all means that it would have been pretty difficult and obviously pretty pointless to make a declaration of interest during those two debates. So that did not occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have acknowledged wrongdoing in not declaring it. But I repeat&mdash;as this is a censure motion, this matter has to be treated with some degree of gravity&mdash;that when it came to a declaration of pecuniary interests, I acted in the way that I am sure all Ministers here do, given that, unlike the Opposition, we have a commitment to those declarations. I have always believed that I should declare whatever personal financial interests I might have in any company. Given that I did not have any such interest, I told my staff simply to put a line through the relevant paragraphs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was a mistake. It occurred because I did not ever regard the directorship of 2HD as a pecuniary interest in any personal sense. And it clearly was not. I received no money from 2HD. I notice that some questions have been asked about credit cards and other things. I did not have one of those&mdash;I did not have a card; I did not have anything. I did not get a bottle of wine at Christmas. I do not think it can be said that I had any personal interest in 2HD whatsoever. In any event, once I got this portfolio and it was obvious that I could not stay in 2HD, I resigned within six days of being sworn in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should also make the point that my colleagues knew of my directorship. I am not certain that every colleague knew, but certainly a lot of them did. No-one ever suggested that I ought not have the directorship. No-one ever suggested that I ought to resign it. I think most of my colleagues took exactly the same view as I did that the purpose of these pecuniary declarations was to put on record any financial benefits that a Minister could potentially have. Because I could not potentially have any, I did not see the point in writing it down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did not take the time to read the document properly and I concede absolutely that I should have. I apologise to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for that. Indeed, I apologise to the Senate. I repeat the apology because I am undoubtedly wrong on that point. I suppose the Senate can determine whether it believes that I should be censured. I might say that I have been censured twice before by the Senate and on neither occasion did I believe that I was wrong. At least on this occasion I am acknowledging a wrongdoing on one of the three points. I do believe, however, that it was minor&mdash;in fact, very minor and I think the fact that I have apologised ought to be enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think I can almost finish on that point. I note that Senator Hill in his address said that he could also have referred to my association with criminal elements, which has been raised in Parliament this week. I think it is worth referring to that. It has been an extraordinary week for Senator Baume. He is able to claim that there is virtue in the Secretary of the Cabinet Office in New South Wales being able to visit the same criminal element, as they term it. That is fine. But if I see the person concerned, it is terrible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want all honourable senators to note that the evidence that I gave in the trial, which is where the information came from, was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> and other Sydney newspapers on the morning of 5 March. Parliament was sitting on 5 March. This matter was regarded as so important by Senator Baume and his colleagues that it was not mentioned. Well, that is fair enough. They might not have picked it up. Mind you, I think every Liberal in New South Wales would have. Nonetheless, it was not picked up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliament then sat on 24, 25 and 26 March. It sat on 30 and 31 March and on 1 and 2 April. It also sat for three days last week. On not one of those days&mdash;not one of them&mdash;was this matter considered important or relevant. It was never raised in here. It was raised only when Senator Baume picked up the scent of blood. This was when matters concerning the Marshall Islands and 2HD were raised. If this was such an outrage, if this was so terrible, how could all those days have passed without there being one mention of this matter? If one wants to raise these things, one does not wait and wait. If they are outrageous, one deals with them straight away. But no-one did so because it just was not as outrageous or as terrible as Senator Baume wanted to suggest it was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any event, that matter will be pursued further. I want Senator Baume to understand that he will not be the only person in this place raising this matter. Once the Meissner appeal is over, I intend to pursue a number of matters concerning that very case and concerning the role of Mr Sturgess in it. They will be pursued here with vigour by me and some of my colleagues. They will also be pursued in the House of Representatives. But, properly, this will have to wait until the appeal is over. I would like the Senate to know that we have not heard the end of the matter because I intend to pursue it, rather than run from it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the other matters, all I can say is that I made one telephone call to the Marshall Islands. I spoke to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade before I made that call. He said that what I proposed to do was proper and so I made the call. I think I have gone into reasonable detail in telling this Senate about my knowledge of Mr Symons's business interests. I do not have knowledge of them. I know that he had something to do with a steel mill in China. I know that he had a scheme in the Marshall Islands. But I cannot name any person he spoke to. I cannot give any detail of it whatsoever. And so I cannot say that I have knowledge of the affairs. I do not know who the scheme has been sold to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I do not know any of that, how can I come in here and tell the Senate that I have knowledge? Because to come in here and say that I have knowledge would have been misleading the Senate. If I had actually come in and said I had knowledge, that would have been misleading the Senate and that is something that I had not ever done and do not intend to do. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has to be said in the context of the speech that has been made today by Senator Richardson that a number of new facts have emerged which have not been known. In the first place, Senator Richardson said that he knew that Mr Symons went to the US and spoke to US officials. And Senator Gareth Evans in his remarks earlier after Question Time asked us to believe that he had no particular reason to investigate what contacts Greg Symons had with Australian embassy and consular officials. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that Senator Richardson in his remarks in this debate has given us and Senator Gareth Evans further reason as to why this should be investigated. The questions that Senator Gareth Evans, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of Australia, should require to know are: what particular US officials did Mr Greg Symons contact? Was any help provided to Mr Greg Symons in making contact with these officials by members of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade? Who were the officials and when did the contact occur?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The substance of the defence of Senator Richardson was that he had no particular knowledge about this scheme.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to a story that appeared on the AAP wire as early as 17 July 1991. I repeat the date, 17 July 1991, which was   many months before the meeting that Senator Richardson has confirmed in the Senate in Question Time today that he had with Mr Greg Symons and Mr Finch the lawyer, both of whom are charged in this scheme. This wire is headed, `Graham Richardson as referee for Australian businessmen in Suva migrants'. It is dated and states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two entrepreneurs trying to set up a scheme providing for Asian business migration to the Marshall Islands have presented a reference from the Australian Minister Graham Richardson.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Richardson has come into this chamber and tried to allege that he knew nothing about these particular activities. This particular wire details at some length the nature of the scheme. It says, among other things:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Their plan calls for development of a $US40 million technology park and education centre called `UNIPAC International'.</PARA>
<PARA>Then it details in black and white exactly what was involved in this scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess that this weekend the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) will have to focus again on whether he will defend Senator Richardson, or whether Mr Keating will take the action that, frankly, he should have taken last week when the conflict of interest of Senator Richardson and his lack of disclosure was made public. Because in the AAP wire of 17 July last year the whole nature of the scheme is detailed in full under the headline, `Senator Richardson as referee for Australian businessmen in Suva migrants'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the Prime Minister has to call for this document. The Prime Minister who failed, it has to be said, at his first hurdle to enforce ministerial standards, will now be seen by the press and by the public as to whether he fails at his second hurdle. It is absolutely clear&mdash;and Senator Cook has at last woken up&mdash;that Senator Richardson knew everything about this particular scheme. There was no paper tabled by the senator in his speech to say that this wire, which detailed the whole nature of the scheme, which carried his name and which was certainly available to his office&mdash;it was available on every computer in Parliament House&mdash;was wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, at that time the senator was probably quite pleased to be associated with this scheme.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some schemes in the Pacific incorporating citizenship in the past have been controversial.</PARA>
<PARA>It was even acknowledged in the wire on 17 July which detailed the scheme and which carried Senator Richardson's name, that this particular project was controversial. Still, after 17 July, the Minister persisted in involving himself in these particular activities. Why was it controversial? The wire said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, the sale of passports by Tonga to Asians recently provoked a major internal political debate.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a Minister of the Crown, remember, the man who knew nothing about this particular scheme, who gave a reference, which was written by the author of the scheme of which he said he had no particular knowledge&mdash;and it was all over the AAP wire on 17 July last year. The wire concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A spokesman for Senator Richardson said tonight that the Minister had known Symons since he was a boy and had been best man at Symons' marriage to Senator Richardson's first cousin. The spokesman said the personal reference had stated that Senator Richardson knew Symons to be an `honest and upstanding citizen' but the Minister had no knowledge of Symons' business dealings.</PARA>
<PARA>That wire was transmitted on 17 July detailing the particular scheme which has now become the subject of a major scandal. I can tell the Senate that this is the first piece of paper that Mr Keating will be calling for later this evening. I suggest that he put to Senator Richardson, `How could you say you knew nothing about this particular scheme when an AAP wire of 17 July last year not only detailed the nature of the scheme, but also bore your name and said it was controversial and yet you still did not put out any statement denying any association with this scheme?'. That is the first question that the Prime Minister has to ask Senator Richardson later this evening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue that has emerged, of course, is whether Senator Richardson has been frank and honest with this Senate. In other words, did he deliberately mislead the Senate in his answer to me on 29 April, and how does that answer tie up with the answer he gave to Senator Hill today regarding Senator Richardson's business dealings? Senator Button, presumably, will have to get up and defend Senator Richardson today&mdash;the same Senator Button who was dumped on by Senator Richardson in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Good Weekend</EMPHASIS> last Saturday, the same man who Senator Richardson so notably tried to get sacked from the Cabinet. Certainly Senator Button has a particularly interesting task today. I warn him not to get too drawn into this rather sordid matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, let me go back to deal with the issue of whether Senator Richardson has misled this chamber. On 29 April I said this to Senator Richardson:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to the Minister's intervention in a case involving a relative, Mr Gregory Symons, facing 11 counts of forgery charges in the Marshall Islands and his claim in a newspaper report yesterday that he had no knowledge of Mr Symons's business affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Remember, of course, the AAP wire of 17 July which carried details of the scheme and his name. I asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Did the Minister provide any details of Mr Symons's business background in his letter of introduction?</PARA>
<PARA>This is the letter of introduction which is not dated. This is the letter of introduction which was written by Mr Gregory Symons himself to advance his own particular business interests. It may not be the same letter, but certainly at this stage of the game it seems to be the same reference, although it has been drawn to the attention of this chamber that the reference quoted in the AAP wire did not carry the same words as were included in the reference I tabled from Senator Richardson. This is what Senator Richardson said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My recollection is yes, I provided a number of details that had been provided to me by Mr Symons. I repeat the statement that I have no knowledge of his business affairs.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a man who is a cousin-in-law, I guess we could probably call him, of very longstanding, over 20 years. The Minister had no knowledge of this man's business affairs, although he was prepared to sign a reference which detailed at some length just how effective a businessman Mr Gregory Symons was. What Senator Richardson continued to say on 19 April is very important. Senator Hill said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But you put in a letter of introduction.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Richardson said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No, that was said in the context of whatever business it is in which he is involved, over which he has been charged. I made the point that I had no knowledge of that business and I repeat it now.</PARA>
<PARA>On 17 July, all the details of the business were in the public arena. Senator Richardson today has tried to qualify that remark by saying, `When you say you have no knowledge of a person's business, you have to remember that I don't know the people to whom he speaks, I don't know his particular dealings'. But that is not what we asked. Of course Senator Richardson does not know. He would not be expected to know all the details of the people with whom he speaks&mdash;and we understand that&mdash;or any subsequent deals made. But we do know that the whole scheme or, as it appears to be, the whole scam, was clearly outlined on 17 July, many months before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, we have this huge attempt by Senator Richardson to put himself as arm's length from this particular function. He is doing it by saying he has no knowledge of the business dealings and that he actually has not much knowledge of the reference which he gave. In fact, he still has not been able to find it. I suspect he has only got the reference because it was, in fact, tabled in this chamber. He said in that context that he had no knowledge of the business dealings with which Mr Gregory Symons is charged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My next point is very important to the Ministers who are about to get up to defend Senator Richardson, and to Mr Keating who is going to have to make a judgment about the future of Senator Richardson. Remember, Senator Richardson said he had no knowledge about Mr Gregory Symons's business dealings in the Marshall Islands, in this chamber, under privilege. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today it was brought to the attention of the Senate that on 12 November last year Senator Richardson was asked whether he met in his parliamentary office with Mr Greg Symons, Mr Patrick Chen and a lawyer. He said that he had a meeting arranged with those three&mdash;or were there more involved?  I think another question that Mr Keating may well ask Senator Richardson is, `Were there any other people involved in that meeting?'. The answer to that may well be interesting. But we do know that this Minister, who has no knowledge of the business dealings in the matter in the Marshall Islands, arranged to meet, on 12 November last year, Mr Finch and Mr Greg Symons, the very same two people who have been charged in relation to the particular scheme.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, Senator Richardson concedes that that occurred. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think Mr Symons and Mr Finch did come; I do not think Mr Chen made it.</PARA>
<PARA>I hope he will check on that. Mr Chen, remember, is the Vice President and Manager of the International Department of the National Bank of the Marshall Islands. Senator Richardson said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not think Mr Chen made it. He had not arrived at the time they came to my office, so I did not meet him. However, I have spoken to Mr Symons and Mr Finch, so I did know that they had a scheme going which was a business migration scheme.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the man, of course, who knew absolutely nothing about this particular matter, despite the cable and the statements made on 17 July. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In November Senator Richardson had a meeting for 10 minutes with the individuals concerned, he said. We want to know what occurred at the meeting. Those are details that I think Mr Keating has to get from Senator Richardson. Senator Richardson, as I have said, has admitted fault on one particular matter. Now Mr Keating has to decide whether he will apply standards of conduct to his Government on this second hurdle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating has to find out the details of what was discussed at that meeting. Senator Richardson, in his answer to Senator Hill in Question Time today, again tried to wriggle out of this. Senator Richardson said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think there is a huge difference between what the Opposition is trying to imply and the truth. I knew that he had a business migration scheme in the Marshall Islands&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is in contrast with what he said on 29 April when he said that he had no knowledge of this particular scheme&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">but as to having knowledge of his business affairs I have none. I do not know to whom in the Marshall Islands he has spoken.</PARA>
<PARA>We have not asked him that; we have not pressed that particular matter. We know that he has spoken to the President of the Marshall Islands. Senator Richardson continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not know to whom he has sold the business part&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>we have not asked him that&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have absolutely no idea.</PARA>
<PARA>What Senator Richardson is trying to do&mdash;not very cleverly, I have to say&mdash;is say, `Yes, I did have knowledge of the business activities because, after all, I had this meeting with the two people who have been charged in this scheme'. Senator Richardson said that the meeting lasted 10 minutes. He conceded knowledge of the scheme in general but not the detail. Of course, he could have gone to the AAP wire of 17 July in which the nature of this scheme was fully outlined. The Minister is ducking and wriggling on this issue. Mr Keating is now faced with failing at the second hurdle to enforce proper standards in his Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What on earth was the then Minister for Social Security doing involving himself in all of these business activities?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the third point. Senator Evans has been drawn into this issue. Senator Richardson asked Senator Evans, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, whether he could phone the President of the Marshall Islands. Senator Evans said that provided it was made clear that it was a call of a personal nature, he did not see a problem with it. It is a funny thing when a Minister of the Crown can phone the head of state of another country and say, `I'm not phoning because I'm an important member of the Government of another country, I'm just phoning as a private citizen, but is it possible for my friend, Mr Greg Symons, to be allowed to come back to Australia?'.

The interesting thing about all of this is that Senator Richardson said he made it crystal clear to the President of the Marshall Islands that he was phoning as a private citizen, not as a senior Minister of the Crown, but what did the people of the Marshall Islands think? What did Senator Richardson say to the people of the Marshall Islands? We know what Senator Evans said he should say and we know what Senator Richardson has told us he said. The issue is: what did the people in the Marshall Islands think Senator Richardson said? I have received an AAP cable today which quotes the Attorney-General of the Marshall Islands, Mr McPhillips.

<PARA>That is what the Attorney-General of the Marshall Islands thought the involvement of Senator Richardson meant. The question is why he came to that conclusion. It would have been very hard for Senator Richardson to divorce himself from the fact that he is a senior Cabinet Minister in the Government of Australia, when he was acting as a private citizen. I can say that, as a private citizen, it is very difficult to get a phone call through to the President of the Marshall Islands. We know from the AAP cable that the Attorney-General of the Marshall Islands recognised that Senator Richardson was calling not as a private citizen but because of the power and influence he had as a senior member of the Keating Government. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Allegations also have been made against Senator Richardson for his disregard of ministerial standards in failing to disclose directorship of a radio station, contrary to the Government's guidelines. There are a few points to be made about that. Senator Richardson has said in this place, `I did the wrong thing'. For the purpose of anybody who is silly enough to be listening to this debate, other than senators, let me say that the Cabinet has guidelines about ministerial conduct. Those guidelines provide that a Minister who holds a directorship shall register it. Senator Richardson did not do that and the circumstances of it are quite clear. He did not do it until such time as he became Minister for Transport and Communications&mdash;or shortly thereafter&mdash;when the matter of a directorship of a radio station was, presumably, graphically brought to his mind by the fact that he was now Minister for Transport and Communications. Senator Richardson has explained his position on that issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If those opposite had any standards on these issues, if they in government had had any rules, or if they in opposition were prepared to accept that there should be rules for senators in relation to these matters they would have had a field day. They could have come in here to the Senate and said, `Senator Richardson is guilty of gross misconduct for what he has done in terms of his directorship. He failed to tell the Senate about the directorship'. But we do not have any such rules in the Senate because those opposite stopped them and have consistently opposed them. That is why they are in a very weak position on this issue. It is the Liberal Party which had no rules in government and which is very keen that there be no rules now. If there had been rules now, those opposite could have caught Senator Richardson and, in years gone by, they probably could have caught me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is that those opposite are not keen on rules; they are keen only on asking that the Government enforce its Cabinet guidelines. I think Senator Richardson's explanation of this matter shows that he regrets&mdash;and I as a Minister in the Government also regret&mdash;that he did not declare his directorship in the register. But the fact of the matter is that, as Senator Richardson tells us&mdash;and there is no reason to disbelieve him for a moment because he did register his directorship when he became Minister for Transport and Communications&mdash;he thought the guidelines were about the question of whether a Minister had any potential pecuniary interest&mdash;any potential of conflict of interest. </PARA>

<PARA>Senator Button's refusal to support Senator Richardson may well bear some relationship to Senator Richardson's well-publicised attempt to dump Senator Button from the position of Leader of the Government in the Senate, and out of the Ministry altogether, after the successful coup that Senator Richardson masterminded against Mr Hawke. Peter Hartcher has written a very detailed examination of this matter, particularly outlining Senator Richardson's views of Senator Button and how he felt the job could be well and truly done by almost anyone else. What apparently stopped Senator Richardson's objective being achieved is the fact that it was pointed out that Senator Button could be even more of a loose cannon on the sinking ship of war that is represented by the Labor Government at the moment than Senator Walsh. He was dissuaded from pursuing that matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is very little to respond to, apart from some 2HD matters, which some of my colleagues might take up, because I have so many other things to raise. There is very little else that Senator Button raised that is worth responding to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that Mr Symons was assistant secretary of Young Labor in 1971 and succeeded some quite interesting people in that movement, such as the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and others of similar importance. No doubt, in that role of assistant secretary of Young Labor, Mr Symons had plenty of good contacts within the Labor movement 20 years ago. It appears that his relationship with Senator Richardson was so good that Senator Richardson would take at face value what Mr Symons said about his commercial activities. I think Senator Richardson said that they probably met once a month or so. Even though they met once a month or so, none of these matters relating to what Mr Symons was doing was ever raised between them. This is curious because, as has been pointed out, this question of the Marshall Islands deal and Mr Symons's role in it was raised with Senator Richardson's office in July 1991 because the matter was regarded by the media as controversial. Despite the fact that it was regarded as controversial and that Senator Richardson's office was approached for a comment, Senator Richardson did nothing&mdash;he expects us to believe&mdash;from July 1991, after being told that the person who had his reference was involved in a controversial set of deals, to establish just what the deals were. That really strains at one's capacity to accept such a proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister, having provided a reference that was dictated by the person involved, is apprised of the fact that the person involved is in a deal which is regarded as controversial and reported as such&mdash;I will go to the details of that in a minute&mdash;and yet in all that time the Minister did nothing to establish, according to the Minister, from Mr Symons, who he met once a month, whether the newspaper report and the concerns about it being a controversial matter were so. That really strains one's capacity to believe what on earth Senator Richardson says. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Button, in one of his brief comments which were germane to the issue&mdash;most of his speech had nothing to do with defending Senator Richardson, and we understand his motives&mdash;said that there was no detail available to Senator Richardson of what this business was all about. That is patently false. The report that was referred to Senator Richardson's office, and for whom a spokesman actually made a comment, is clearly stated in the AAP news sheet of 17 July 1991. That information was presented to Senator Richardson's office at the time. It details what is proposed. I will read the relevant bits of it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The latest issue of The Marshall Islands Journal quotes Symons as saying the scheme is backed by a consortium of interests which have "extensive experience in the marketing and management of business migration investment programs".</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A letter of intention to the Marshall's Government said the technology park would be located within a special trade zone close to the international airport at Majuro.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It states that investors would be entitled to business migration status with rights to operate in the complex.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, there would be access to US and other markets under the Marshall's "developing country" status.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The group said it planned an education centre with accommodation facilities for up to 1,000 students from Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and the Peoples' Republic of China.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">According to the Marshall Islands Journal, the idea was that students would work at the value added production facilities at the same time as upgrading their education in preparation for entering tertiary institutions in the US, Australia and elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some schemes in the Pacific incorporating citizenship in the past have been controversial.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, the sale of passports by Tonga to Asians recently provoked a major international political debate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A spokesman for Senator Richardson said tonight that the Minister had known Symons since he was a boy and had been best man at Symons' marriage to Senator Richardson's first cousin.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The spokesman said the personal reference had stated that Senator Richardson knew Symons to be an "honest and upstanding citizen" but the Minister had no knowledge of Symons' business dealings.</PARA>
<PARA>After that report came out, one would have thought that a normal, reasonable, rational person would have decided to get some knowledge of Mr Symons's business dealings, but Senator Richardson either chose not to do so or decided, in his meetings once a month or so with Mr Symons, that this was a sleeping dog that he would rather let lie. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Talking of sleeping dogs that one would rather let lie, Senator Richardson made the point in his defence that it was curious that I had not mentioned at the time the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> report of 5 March 1992 on the matter that I brought up this week about Mr Meissner and Mr Warren Anderson. The reason I did not bring it up is very simple. The newspaper report which dealt with the Meissner court case&mdash;and Virginia Perger pleading guilty to having made a false statement&mdash;said that Senator Richardson told the court that in the late 1970s, when he was the general secretary of the New South Wales ALP, he had met Meissner several times; Meissner was then secretary of the Enmore branch. They had also met twice in the 1980s when the allegations resurfaced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I read that I dismissed it as a matter of substance because I could not believe that it would have taken place while Senator Richardson was a member of this place&mdash;while he was a senator. I was accustomed to him meeting all sorts of curious people, dealing with all sorts of curious people, having as frequent visitors in his office various curious people and having people who would stand over Senator Faulkner in the lift on the way to Senator Richardson's office&mdash;and I have the details of that and Senator Faulkner's statement about it. I was accustomed to that sort of behaviour while Senator Richardson was general secretary of the Labor Party&mdash;that is why it did not excite my interest&mdash;but I was astounded when I saw the transcript to find that this sort of behaviour was not just in the 1980s. This was in 1986 when Senator Richardson was a senator and when he determined to risk his reputation and that of his Party in an extraordinary way, not only by seeing Mr Meissner but by seeing him in a covert way, in an extraordinary way&mdash;driving around in a car so no-one could see them; meeting on a street corner; Mr Meissner jumping into Senator Richardson's car; no-one was to know; and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is natural that I could not have imagined that this report related to 1986. Having himself raised the matter of his involvement with crime figures, criminals and people who have been in gaol or who are in gaol, I remind the Minister in absentia&mdash;he is not here but I certainly remind Senator Faulkner, who has a great interest in these matters, having been on the receiving end of some of this activity&mdash;of the executive report for the ALP's 1985 New South Wales Left Caucus Conference, which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Richardson's protection of this criminal penetration of the party was a crime against the party and the people of New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA>I understand that, and I also understand that the members of the Left in New South Wales&mdash;many of whom are now members of the House of Representatives or senators&mdash;have left on the record a series of damning indictments of Senator Richardson and his behaviour towards them in the internecine branch warfare that went on in New South Wales.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you want it done very briefly, Mr Acting Deputy President, I will briefly say this: I found it extraordinary that Senator Richardson would continue to have an association with a criminal, for example, like Meissner after he had become a senator. I particularly find extraordinary his various admissions in various places that he has associated with such notorious criminals&mdash;not only Meissner but also Tom Domican and, of course, that Balmain welding group, including Danny Casey, who lent Senator Richardson money and who employed Mrs Richardson at home for two years, and a host of unsavoury characters such as Eric Delaney, William Sinclair, Stan `The Man' Smith, Martin Olsen, Wayne Thelander, Mark Madigan, Paul Dole, Father O'Dwyer of Fine Cotton fame, and Leslie Dance.

It is just bad luck, too, that he admits some responsibility for allowing the situation which led to the Baldwin bashing, for example, to get out of hand.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was enormous patronage for jobs, by every local council, no matter whether the Left had it or we did.</PARA>
<PARA>Patronage on jobs: what sort of support has the Minister given in this case? Is it exactly the same sort of support and patronage to mates that has gone on for years? It is just a repetition of the pattern of behaviour that existed when Senator Richardson was general secretary of the ALP. In what amounts to some sort of confession of establishing vast political machines on the public purse, again he says in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mates</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even though you didn't need the workforce you hired all the boys to sweep the streets, pick up the garbage or whatever. And so both sides tolerated crookery for years; we tolerated more than the Left, but both sides did it.</PARA>
<PARA>The relevance of that is that `we tolerated crookery', says Senator Richardson. Here we have an example of a man arrested on a charge, which I suppose one could say related to crookery, in a situation where the Minister should have known what the details of the deal were and that it involved controversy. In fact, way back in 1991, the outlines had been supplied at least to his office and a story relating to the controversial nature of that deal had been made available. But here he is: he tolerated crookery for years. This is a continuing pattern of behaviour. Senator Richardson conceded at the time, once again in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mates</EMPHASIS>, that the Left:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">all thought that I had allowed a situation to develop where a bashing could occur and did occur. To some extent, they were right.</PARA>
<PARA>What concerns me is this: to what extent is Senator Richardson once again letting things drift&mdash;being prepared to write a reference for someone who is a mate without concern for what is in that reference? That is why it relates very clearly. Once again in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mates</EMPHASIS>, there is a whimsical remark. It reads:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You never get tired of that.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know particularly in what context and whether he was joking, but it does seem that the attacks on the left wing of the Labor Party in the past in New South Wales are part of this pattern of, if you like, total dismissal of the normal standards. It is a dismissal of those normal standards which has got Senator Richardson into this difficulty today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a May 1982 document called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Abuse of Power&mdash;the Crisis in New South Wales Labor</EMPHASIS> which is marked `Confidential, internal ALP circulation only', the ALP Membership Defence Committee, which is in fact the left front, made a lot of startling claims about criminality in the Labor Party. It attacked Graham Richardson's attempt in the May 1982 ALP State Council to denounce branch stacking by both sides as hypocritical twaddle. The document states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For years, said the Left, decent party members of all ideological persuasions were subject to a nightmare of intimidation, death threats and actual violence as the result of the penetration of party branches by an element with close links to organised crime.</PARA>

Ministers of the Crown have made massive attacks on Senator Richardson, his credibility, decency and involvement with crime and none of these attacks has ever been withdrawn&mdash;not one of them. These men sit in the same ministry, in the same Cabinet, as Senator Richardson and not one of them has withdrawn accusations of standover tactics and improper behaviour, all by Senator Richardson.

That is what the Opposition has not proved, cannot prove and will not be able to prove, because it did not happen. The more one listens to the interjections from the other side the more it becomes clear that if this censure motion is passed, it will not be passed on the basis of the charge in the motion, nor will it be passed on the basis of any proof of the matters contained in any document we have seen; it will be passed on the basis of misconceptions, presuppositions and allegations&mdash;all of which have not been proven.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, it is a proper exercise of this Senate's powers to pass a censure motion against anybody it wants, whether or not it is justified. That is the power of the Senate. But whether or not that is fair is a different question. And whether it has been done without minds being prejudiced is another question. The big question in this instance is: will a decision made against Senator Richardson be a fair one in terms of natural justice? The two legs of natural justice are: firstly, that people come to the issue with an unbiased mind; and, secondly, that they listen to the other side and treat that fairly. The issue then is whether that is being done. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the censure motion moved by Senator Hill earlier this day. The three-part motion is set out very clearly as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That this Senate censures the Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Richardson:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) for clearly and deliberately misleading the Senate in claiming on 29 April to have no knowledge of the business affairs of Mr Greg Symons, presently on trial for breaches of the laws of the Marshall Islands.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) for his disregard of Ministerial standards in failing to disclose a Directorship in a radio station contrary to the Government's own guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA>Earlier today I asked Senator Evans, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, whether he would, in fact, disclose to the Senate the nature of any dealings between Mr Symons and the Australian Embassy or consulates in the United States. In answer to my question, Senator Evans simply said he would not; he said he would not in very much the same terms as he continually said he would not institute investigations from 1989 onwards when Brian Burke was the subject of much disquiet among members on this side of the House&mdash;and that finally was proved to be founded, of course, through the Royal Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked Senator Evans in a supplementary question whether he would undertake to the Senate that he would, in fact, cause an investigation to be made and that he would report back to the Senate. After Question Time, I moved to take note of his answer and spoke very strongly concerning this matter, drawing the analogy between his behaviour with regard to protecting Brian Burke and his behaviour now in protecting Senator Richardson. I find it interesting that he is not one of the speakers defending Senator Richardson. In fact, one could only say that the line up of speakers that the Labor Party has been able to muster is very poor indeed. There is not a single, solitary Minister&mdash;with the exception of Senator Button, who spent his entire time talking about anything but the motion at hand. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SE4">Senator BISHOP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. The answer is, to answer Secretary McMullan's interjection very specifically, it is his Minister, a Minister and a member of the Executive of this Government, who stands charged with the censure motion. The fact is that Senator McMullan and his colleagues have chosen not to defend him in any meaningful way and have dredged up poor Senator Barney Cooney, who they pull out for the defence every time there is a difficulty where others do not want to speak. If Senator McMullan's side of politics chooses not to support the man who is the author and the instigator of the downfall of Prime Minister Hawke and the implementer of putting Prime Minister Keating in place, then other people will make a judgment about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Going back to 23 November 1989, I refer to a question asked by former Senator Chaney of Senator Evans. Former Senator Chaney asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Has the Minister noted that the Ambassador to Ireland, Mr Brian Burke, who is at present visiting Perth, has intervened in domestic politics in Western Australia by sending a note to the current Premier denying having attempted to delay a corporate affairs inquiry into one of the many business disasters which have marked Labor's term in office?  In light of Mr Burke's intimate involvement in a series of serious abuses of government in Western Australia, will the Minister ensure that the Ambassador does not return to Dublin until his role in the Swan Building Society affair and the other failed business dealings initiated by his Government can be properly investigated?</PARA>
<PARA>Before I go to Senator Evans's reply, I make the analogy between that question asked by then Senator Chaney back in 1989 and the matters that we are dealing with regarding the behaviour of Senator Richardson, particularly that part of the censure motion that relates to the `improper interference in the justice system of the Marshall Islands'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here, in Senator Chaney's question, we had Mr Burke intervening to try to help his mates out; and in the question concerning Senator Richardson, we have Senator Richardson intervening to help his mate out. Not only is the mate a mate but he is also a relative by marriage, said to have been a mate for 20 years and said to be such a close and trusted mate that he drafted the reference that Senator Richardson signed for Mr Symons. That is quite a close relationship, I would have thought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us go to the answer that Senator Evans gave to the then Senator Chaney back in November 1989 and compare it with the answer he gave here today. In 1989, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will do nothing of the kind, Mr President. This question does not bear in any way on the conduct of Mr Burke's duties as Ambassador to Ireland, which he has been performing with admirable competence. We have had nothing but a tirade of scuttlebutt and innuendo from Senator Chaney, of which he should be ashamed.</PARA>
<PARA>He further said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am aware that a number of squalid partisan allegations have been made about Mr Burke in this respect and I am sure that his shoulders are big enough to deal with them.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the same so-called defence was used: innuendo and squalid partisan allegations&mdash;anything but an acknowledgment or a wish to find out the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the birds came home to roost, did they not. Brian Burke was found to be everything that all the so-called innuendo and allegations said he was&mdash;a man of whom Western Australia and Australia as a whole should be thoroughly ashamed, a man who rorted the official system and a man who rorted his privileges as Ambassador. Yet this is the man who, again and again, Senator Evans failed to say he would make any investigations about at all. So again today we heard the same line, `You're just saying nasty things about my friend Graham Richardson' and, `It's all innuendo and I don't propose to investigate it'. Senator Evans's conduct in this matter is also to be condemned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans also said that he wanted to see some substance as to why he ought to conduct that investigation. My colleagues who have spoken in this debate before me have provided ample evidence. Senator Kemp in his speech drew everybody's attention to the AAP cable dated 17 July 1991. One sentence in that cable struck me in particular because it was relevant to that question I asked today. That cable says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, there would be access to US and other markets under the Marshall's `developing country' status.</PARA>
<PARA>Quite clearly, in the scheme that is outlined in that July 1991 AAP cable, of which the Minister must have been aware because the heading is `Graham Richardson as referee for Australian businessmen in Suva migrants'&mdash;if anybody puts anyone's name to things like that I am sure that nobody in this chamber would be unaware of it, so the Minister must have been aware of it&mdash;he saw that the US connection was fundamental to this scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Senate here today, Senator Richardson admitted he knew that Mr Symons had a scheme, he knew that the scheme concerned a migrant plan and he must have known that it included access to the United States. Accordingly, I asked that question today and I will go on asking that question today because I believe that there is something that needs to be clarified and brought to the attention of the Senate. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 29 April published an article written by Bernard Lagan and Mark Skulley who say that they spoke to Mr Symons briefly. They went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald</EMPHASIS> spoke to him&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Symons&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">briefly yesterday before apparently being cut off. Later attempts to speak to him were unsuccessful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The allegation that Senator Richardson `heavied' the Marshall Island Government to drop the charges was made in the Victorian Parliament on April 16 by the Liberal MLA for Ballarat North, Mr Stephen Elder, who refused to make any comment yesterday. Mr Elder told Parliament: "For $US250,000 [each], he [Symons] has provided passports to people to enable them to gain access to the United States of America through the Marshall Islands, which is a protectorate of the United States . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, the question that I asked of Senator Evans today is relevant to the statement that is being made; that is, that a scam was being worked by Mr Symons that would enable him, for the payment of large sums of money, to get people into the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Evans goes on saying that he refuses to investigate or make the investigation of the one embassy and, I think he said, six consulates in the United States, he will have to provide a better answer to this place and to the general public than he has done to date. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Was the huge sum of money raised by Brian Burke for the Hawke campaign in 1987 the reason he was appointed Ambassador to Ireland shortly thereafter?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Evans, going into bat for Mr Burke again, answered:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Burke is a distinguished Australian in his own right, as should be amply evident from his performance throughout his public career.</PARA>
<PARA>Well, that bit was right&mdash;his performance is amply evident. We now make a judgment about what a disgraceful period in Western Australian history that premiership was and what disgraceful rorts and fraud were perpetrated in that period. Yet the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, who holds himself to be so upright, said that Brian Burke is a distinguished Australian. Senator Evans went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have made it clear that Mr Burke is universally regarded as a distinguished Australian and a very successful Premier of the State of Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Lots of people disagreed with that then, and countless more disagree with it now that the Royal Commission has shown what a disgraceful period that was. Yet we have never heard an apology from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade as to why he refused point-blank to make any investigation or to withdraw Mr Burke from Ireland during that period. We cannot have it repeated in this chamber. I say to the Senate that it is absolutely essential that Senator Evans be made and obliged to make an investigation and to come back to this Parliament and report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to Senator Richardson deliberately misleading the Senate by claiming on 29 April to have no knowledge of the business affairs of Mr Greg Symons, Senator Kemp pointed out quite admirably that this was a blatant misleading of the Parliament. Senator Button and Senator Cooney say&mdash;and I presume Senator McMullan when he rises after me will say&mdash;that to instance the very good description of the scheme that Senator Richardson has acknowledged he knew about, and as set out in this AAP cable of 17 July 1991, is to draw a conclusion which is not sustainable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Richardson's thorough disregard of ministerial statements in failing to disclose a directorship in a radio station, contrary to the Government's guidelines, has simply been pushed off by his saying, `Look, I just forgot about it. I had a moment's blackout. I just did not remember'. There is no record of Cabinet discussions as to whether people disclosed that they had a vested interest or interest of any sort and should be excluded from the discussion. We simply have Senator Richardson's statement that he did not participate in any discussions concerning anything to do with communications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite frankly, that is not good enough either. There is nothing to back up Senator Richardson's claim that that was the case. No fellow Minister has said, `I was there and I remember when he said, "I can't discuss this matter with you because I am a director of 2HD"'. Nothing of that nature has been brought before the Senate in any way to bolster the bland statement by Senator Richardson that he simply behaved in that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of particular concern to many of us was the discussion that went on with respect to the banning of the freedom of speech and the appalling ad ban legislation which finally came before this House. We all know that the strategy by Mr Hogg, in collaboration with the likes of Senator Richardson and others, was a determined effort to try to give a political advantage to the Labor Party which is broke, bankrupt, cannot raise any money and would not have been able to pay for the advertisements. </PARA>

In no way, shape or form can that be seen to be an equitable position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When earlier my colleague Senator Michael Baume spoke on this issue he referred to the book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mates</EMPHASIS> and gave many quotations from it. He drew attention to the fact that there was a general skiting about the behaviour of Mr McLeay, Senator Richardson and others&mdash;of the sort of behaviour they tolerated and the way they went on. Senator Baume noted my interjection when I said that they were all very close friends. It is not just a question of friendship or mateship. The concept of mateship began as a very honourable one. But it has been debased by the way it has been used by the Labor Party, particularly in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just to show how ruthless and mercenary this operation, headed by Senator Richardson, is, I quote from an article in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Good Weekend</EMPHASIS>. For all intents and purposes, the article is about Senator Richardson skiting about how smart he was to put a dagger in the throat of Mr Hawke and to elevate his first best mate, Mr Keating, into the prime ministership&mdash;this unelected Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Senator Button came into the chamber to defend his ministerial colleague, he was reluctant even to mention his name. He spoke about anything but the word `Richardson'. Why should one be surprised?  Senator Button presumably read the article, as I had, which says on page 12:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, Richardson had suggested to Hawke that he consider dumping the Government's third most senior member, the Industry Minister, John Button, also the Leader of the Government in the Senate. The gnomish Button is renowned for his disarmingly frank public statements about the state of the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Richardson believed that Button had lost energy and initiative&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is complimentary, is it not?&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and should be replaced. Hawke agreed with him that the industry portfolio should be reinvigorated, but he baulked at demoting Button. He said to Richardson: "If you think Peter Walsh [the outspoken and provocative former Finance Minister] has been a problem for the Government, wait till you see John Button in action."</PARA>
<PARA>I am sure that Bob Hawke did not give that quote to Peter Hartcher, who wrote this article. As he made that quote to Graham Richardson, then only Graham Richardson could have managed to get it in this article. The article then goes on to describe at great length the duplicity of Graham Richardson and the manner in which he pretended to be the first best friend of Hawke and deliver his strategy whilst at the same time undermine him in a way that is described again on page 12:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">WITH GREAT enthusiasm but extreme secrecy, Graham Richardson meanwhile set about organising the systematic isolation of the Prime Minister. He set out to deprive Hawke of the support of his inner-most circle of political allies, of his Cabinet, of his political friends, even his long-standing friends in the business world. He wanted it to become utterly clear to Hawke that he was hopelessly, desperately, friendlessly finished.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was better to pressure Hawke out of office&mdash;privately, discreetly, but with some dignity&mdash;than to blast him out&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and on it goes. Here is evidence of the sort of duplicity that Senator Richardson is prepared to engage in with his own colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What then for a mate? What then for a mate called Greg Symons, married to Senator Richardson's cousin? Senator Richardson was best man at his wedding. He was prepared to write a reference for Mr Symons and he, the Minister, simply signed it. If Senator Richardson is prepared to undermine and pretend to befriend the man who has won elections for the Labor Party, how then would he go out to help someone to whom he thought he owed a real obligation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for this censure motion is that it is not possible for our system to work if we appear to have one rule for some and another rule for others.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Having listened to all my colleague Senator Bronwyn Bishop said, very little else can be said. However, I want to make a very brief point. On 29 April, Senator Richardson denied that he knew the business details of Mr Symons, even though he had given him a reference. For the moment, I will give Senator Richardson the benefit of the doubt. I am not arguing against what my colleagues might have said, but I will give Senator Richardson the benefit of the doubt. In giving him the benefit of the doubt, I ask him why he did not know of Mr Symons's affairs or the affairs about which he was giving a reference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A reference from me would not carry the same weight as a reference from a Minister. However, if someone asked me for a reference, I would ask why. Moreover, if that person wanted it for an overseas project or whatever, I would ask him or her to bring in his or her submission. I would take a copy of the submission and flick through it with that person. I would ensure I kept it on file so that, whatever happened, I could refer to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask Senator Richardson where the submission is. If he does not have it, why? I am giving him the benefit of the doubt at present, but why did he not inquire after Mr Symons? It should have been his business to find out what he was recommending and then to give a reference or otherwise according to what he found. Obviously he did not do that. As for Senator Richardson writing a reference without consulting the person who requested it, that has been well covered. He was negligent in that matter. If he gave a recommendation without knowing the facts, if nothing else, he has certainly been negligent. He should at least apologise for that. Senator Richardson has negligently used his office as an Australian Cabinet Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Richardson admitted his fault on another matter: he had not declared that he was a director of a radio station in New South Wales, so he apologised. Senator Richardson claimed he was working in a private capacity when he rang up the President of the Marshall Islands. He used that standard for that task. He says that he rang in a private capacity, not as a Minister. I can imagine that if a private citizen or even a back bench senator rang the President of the Marshall Islands, he or she would not get through to him. But with the weight of a Minister, one would be able to get through to the President. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we give Senator Richardson the benefit of the doubt and assume that he did ring in a private capacity, that the call was taken as such and that he did not want to be negligent, why did he not give a recommendation for Mr Symons in a private capacity? But no, he has been negligent in using his office as a senior Cabinet Minister to give a recommendation about a person of whose affairs he did not know at that time. That is what Senator Richardson must be condemned for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through interjections this afternoon I have made that point to both Senator Button and Senator Cooney. Both claimed that that point is not included in the motion of censure. They may say that the point should have been included in the motion and that, if it was in the motion, they would admit to it. The least Senator Richardson can do is apologise to the Senate for negligently using his office of an Australian Cabinet Minister in supplying a reference. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We find ourselves embroiled in a rather tired old affair because of the Opposition. It is a sort of post-hoc, after-the-event attempt to justify the pre-publicity about the big attack that was to be launched this week on Senator Richardson. Last week there were going to be all these great hits performed on Senator Richardson. This was part of a great new strategy. The one thing nobody was surprised about was that there was a new strategy, because the old one&mdash;the Fightback strategy&mdash;had failed and had been abandoned. There is no doubt about that.

Senator Hill tried to make it look as though he was interested in it, but clearly he was not. Then we had a couple of the normal old back bench reliables and Senator Baume.

If we are going to find that this is the basis upon which the traditionally significant censure motion should be operated, it is no wonder that the device of people being censured in the Senate has fallen into some disrepute in this Parliament. I remember that soon after I came here one of our House of Representatives Ministers was censured. I defended him valiantly and he was censured&mdash;perhaps because I defended him valiantly, I do not know.

It is bringing into disrepute what should be a very important last resort mechanism of the Senate and of the Parliament. It is trivialising what should be the serious business of the Parliament.

It is the ninety-second anniversary of the first sitting of the Commonwealth Parliament. It also happens to be the anniversary of the first sitting in the temporary Parliament House in Canberra in 1927. That date is also the anniversary of the first day of sitting in 1988 in this new Parliament House. It is because of that that we on this nearest sitting day of the Parliament to 9 May have former members here. We toasted them in a reception that the Presiding Officers gave here at six o'clock this evening. </PARA>

I refer to former Senator Puplick, a Liberal; former Senator Macklin, a Democrat; and former Senator Black, a member of the Labor Party.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They have written a book together in which they have picked up some of the positive values of the Australian public. In writing a book, they have sought, very sincerely, to bring attention to the inadequacies of this place that the public already perceives and which they, having been here for many years, from all three parties, are most regretful and disappointed about in the behaviour of senators and members. They have summoned up a character who they call Senator Frank Bragger. Senator Frank Bragger, in the Macklin-Puplick-Black description, is a consummate politician. He is successful, a self-promoter, a junketeer, an opportunist par excellence, and someone for whom ethics is no strong point. </PARA>

We ought to be rebuked, not only by the Australian public in reinforcing good old Australian values but also by our former colleagues, such as we had here as guests of the Parliament on Parliament Day. I am not flattered at all that one of the caricatures of Australian parliamentarians is Senator Bragger.

Certainly he has been one of the predominant politicians in putting forward his philosophy both in this Parliament and in this country.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister, before witnesses, had agreed with Mr Keating that he would hand over the prime ministership some months after any successful election for the Labor Party. When the then Prime Minister a few months after the election did not deliver on that deal&mdash;a deal which he had lied about to the Australian public at the time of the election&mdash;Mr Keating was so put out that he made it known to his colleagues, and eventually to all of us, that the Prime Minister had ratted on a deal with him, that the Prime Minister had let him down, and that the Prime Minister had lied to the Australian public during the election. Such destabilising behaviour eventually led to Mr Keating being successful by a narrow margin when the Labor Party knifed Mr Hawke. The person principally organising the numbers to get Mr Hawke out and Mr Keating in was Senator Richardson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was therefore not surprising that at that time, in early June last year, a number of senators asked Senator Richardson, `How do you justify a Prime Minister lying on a principal matter at the last election? Do you condone this, Senator Richardson? What is your view about lies in election campaigns?' Senator Richardson's reply was, `The end justifies the means. If the outcome is in my judgment to the betterment of Australia, then anything is possible'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I totally reject such a principle being used to excuse lies by politicians or by anybody else. I rise to make it abundantly clear that the kind of principle that Senator Richardson espoused last June should be totally rejected in a debate such as this not only by Opposition senators but also by his own colleagues in the Government. When we are in government in one year's time, if there is ever such misconduct by a Government Minister&mdash;indeed, by any senator, myself included&mdash;I ask that it be brought it to my attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that we should be able to admit when there has been misconduct, when there has been an abuse of authority, when there has been bullying or favouritism, and especially when there has been lying to or misleading of either the public or the Parliament. I refer to this because Senator Richardson put us all on notice 11 months ago that when a politician deceives or gets up to lie, it is all right so long as, in that politician's mind, the end result is the betterment of Australia. Let me quote Senator Richardson's words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my view when you're putting the nation first . . . then I don't know if you want to put it as `the end justifies the means'; all I know is that the betterment of Australia will justify almost anything.</PARA>
<PARA>The betterment of Australia will justify knifing down a politician, but one can argue that that is fair game. The former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, has left the Parliament. One might argue that that is fair game. But what I will never accept is that to mislead or lie to the Australian public or to the Parliament can be justified subjectively by the liar saying, `It is all right. I am doing this for the betterment of Australia'. Such a slippery road is the road to hell, and I reject it. Therefore, not only am I concerned about the particular conduct that has led to the censure motion and to the three items set out therein; I am also even more concerned about the unrepentant espousing by Senator Richardson of `the end justifies the means' for any politician who thinks that he or she can lie if it is for the betterment of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, in the question that Senator McMullan and Senator Button have referred to, which I asked in Question Time today in the Parliament, I referred Senator Richardson to this principle and to that event. I asked him whether he now drew back from it and whether he now rejected the principle that he put forward in June last year that the end justifies the means for any politician who lies in order to do what, in his judgment, was for the betterment of Australia. He just repeated the words: `I hope we would all seek the betterment of Australia'. There was no resiling. There was no apology. I put it to the Senate that Senator Richardson is espousing a value which is unacceptable to this Senate. It is unacceptable to the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that one of the issues in the coming election campaign is whether Mr Keating, the present Prime Minister, also has this attitude. He justified even his own then Prime Minister and colleague, Mr Hawke, lying at the last election. He has made no criticism and he has explicitly condoned it. Not so Senator Tate, and not so most of the Labor Party in both Houses of the Parliament. But it is on the record and it has not been withdrawn by the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, or by Senator Richardson. Senator Button has withdrawn. He wobbled for a while and then could see that this was not a value which he could be proud of, and that it was a value which the Australian people actually reject, and he came back on board. But the two great offenders in this matter are on the record, and continue to be on the record today, as saying that they believe one can lie if one subjectively thinks it is for the betterment of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say this a number of times in order to underline that both sides of this Parliament ought to give consideration to such a principle and reject it. Whenever we have before us a Minister who is having to answer careful questions about conduct that appears to be cronyism, that appears to be linked with someone who is up on criminal charges of some significance in another country, where he was the referee for that person and where it appears that he has rung the President of that country as a Cabinet Minister of this country on the face of it to help his mate, that kind of favouritism, cronyism, bullying and misuse of authority is unacceptable to the people of Australia and is unacceptable, I believe, to the majority of senators and members of this Parliament. It is unacceptable whether it is a Labor Minister or a Liberal or National Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That kind of behaviour can become exposed by the press and by questions in the Parliament and more and more information becomes available. It has appeared this week&mdash;let anyone deny it&mdash;that we have had information by increment, and eventually it becomes clear, `Oh, the Minister actually does know quite a deal more than he first admitted about his mate'. I believe that the Australian public wants Ministers and parliamentarians who speak the truth, not only in election campaigns but also in the conduct of their responsibilities as Ministers and parliamentarians. I believe that the Australian public wants Ministers and members of Parliament who act upon merit and act for the objective and accountable benefit of Australians and not subjectively to protect their own favourites. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for these reasons that I speak on this principle and that I call in to my support such recollections of this place as we have been provided with by our recently departed Senators Puplick, Macklin and Black. I hope that from this debate today we will be all the more resolved, within our own party rooms, within our own personal contacts with other parliamentarians and, certainly, in this chamber, to require of each other that there be no ends justifying means when it comes to misleading or lying. I hope and expect that the Democrat senators, not only those here in the chamber but also those in other parts of this building, will all the more underline that matter by their vote today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A censure motion is normally a very serious matter. Certainly in the past it has been considered a very serious matter for debate in any house of parliament. Inevitably, in the past&mdash;I might say now the distant past&mdash;to be censured as a Minister was, in a sense, almost a compulsion to resign or to offer one's resignation. Unfortunately, the censure motion has been used in this Parliament, and especially in the Senate, on far too many occasions, based upon the flimsiest of evidence with obviously a very political agenda behind it, and now censure motions are being taken for what they unfortunately are; that is, a politically motivated activity which is designed primarily to besmirch or, on the flimsiest of evidence, simply to knock a political opponent out of the ring.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The censure motion we are dealing with today falls very much into that category. There are some disturbing features of this particular censure motion and of some of the speeches that were given in this chamber. I do not deny that most of the principles that Senator Teague talked about are extremely applicable here. They must be applied here as the standard of conduct for politicians in both Houses of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, we have gone beyond that because some of the speeches here practise the art of guilt by association. That is the first principle which I find obnoxious. I do not make judgments about people's lives, private or public. On the whole, I think I am fairly unjudgmental about it because so often I have found in my political career that what appears to meet the eye is in fact not the reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia, particularly over the last 10 years, has been absolutely covered with the mud thrown in royal commissions, committees of inquiry and parliamentary inquiries, going back, I think in some ways, to the days of the trial&mdash;if we can call it that, and I think it is a fair description&mdash;of Justice Lionel Murphy in the Senate when the Senate itself became judge and jury, and when some of the people involved in that process simply said, `I do not care whether he is guilty or not; he is going to go'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That attitude has now permeated a great deal of what we loosely define as the judgmental system in this country, and I do not just mean the judiciary and the courts. I mean the use of this place as a method of judging people for some real or imagined sin. There have been a significant number of royal commissions in this country which have besmirched the reputation of politicians; where the evidence has not been sufficient to allow a proper conviction in a court of law; where taxpayers' money has been used to attack a political opponent; and where taxpayers' money ended up in the very big pockets of lawyers. We have almost created an industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, I do not agree with my own Party's activity in Tasmania when the former Premier, Robin Gray, was refused legal assistance when he was charged&mdash;if one can call it charged&mdash;before a royal commission. I do agree that he should have carried his own costs when he took his action in the Supreme Court of Tasmania to try to undermine the validity of the Royal Commission; but certainly he, like anyone else, should not have been $150,000 out of pocket as a result of something which occurred and which led to nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the day the Royal Commission said, `Yes, Robin Gray has certain character defects'. I can testify to that. The man has certainly kicked me around the kitchen in Tasmania from time to time in what I regard as very improper ways, to stop me getting a job in the Education Department and that type of thing. But Robin Gray had the right to go into that Royal Commission, to be legally represented, and, at the end of it when his name was cleared in a sense in terms of the possibility of criminal conviction, to be reimbursed for his legal expenses; but not those legal expenses which related to his action in the Supreme Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, Terry Metherell has the right to be supported in some form or another by the taxpayer before the ICAC, especially if Premier Nick Greiner is being represented and paid for by the State, especially if another Minister is receiving the same support and especially if Mr Humphreys, a public servant, is also receiving assistance. Yet Mr Metherell stands to pay out something like $100,000 or more&mdash;and I would say that is a conservative estimate&mdash;in legal fees in order to defend his name. The man has been dumped by an active duplicity on the part of the Liberal leaders in New South Wales who got their fingers caught in the bickie tin. Instead of having the tin shut on their fingers, they have shut it on Terry Metherell's fingers. The simple fact is that the Premier of New South Wales stood to gain from giving a job to Terry Metherell, but the Premier of New South Wales is being represented with public money and Terry Metherell is not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could go through a number of areas where people in this country&mdash;and increasingly politicians&mdash;are being subjected to innuendo and legal processes which damage and besmirch their names. I will call them `semi-legal', because often they are described as royal commissions. These are processes where the normal burden of proof, which has existed in our legal system for years in ordinary courts, does not exist any more. For example, the right to remain silent is not accepted in a significant number of royal commissions; and hearsay evidence is accepted. We know that both of those principles would not be accepted in an ordinary court of law. Royal commissions severely damage people's reputations and, in many ways, make it impossible for them to come to trial and get a fair trial anywhere in this country. By the time they actually get to trial, if there is a trial, they are so totally besmirched, that one would have to be living somewhere in the mountains of Papua New Guinea not to know about some of the so-called evidence that has been given before the royal commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I offer that as a comment about which I feel very strongly. I believe that, because of what we do to each other, politicians are actually creating a milieu in which, as Senator Teague says, our neighbours and others ask questions about politicians and others who appear to be beyond the pale. Our reputations as community representatives appear to be lower than those of bad used car salesmen. As Senator Teague said, when the bouquets are being handed out, we certainly do not get them and the notion of public service is becoming less attractive to people of talent, ability and commitment to their community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why on earth would some of my colleagues go into the Parliament simply so that they can wake up every morning to a grotty newspaper story about a love boat flopped on their front paths day after day for eight years on a convicted perjurers's word? Those people have kids who presumably walk out and pick up the morning paper, and there is dad on the love boat with his name blazoned across the front page. On whose evidence? What is provable? Do honourable senators know how the story started? Years ago during an Estimates committee hearing I asked ABC personnel whether the ABC paid for that story. They said, `Yes. We gave her $1,000 and she gave the story'. She only gave the story because they cajoled her into doing it. She did not want to do it when she got into the studio. She said, `Oh, I do not want to be in this'. They reminded her that there was $1,000 around and she had been paid for it. The ABC was starting to move into cheque book journalism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked the ABC personnel who were representing the ABC at that Estimates committee hearing whether they could guarantee to me that the ABC would not indulge in cheque book journalism again. That cheque book journalism has affected a significant number of my colleagues. I do not know anything about this incident, but I do know that at least a couple have had nothing to do with it. It is sheer dirt. </PARA>

The so-called photographs which nobody has ever seen were being offered around. There was $100,000 sitting there to buy photographs and more information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Senator Teague talks about the besmirching of politicians and the political system, we have to look not only around here, but throughout the whole of the political network. We have to say to ourselves, `We are doing it to each other'. The press reports us. The press does not report Mrs Beverley Aulich in Tasmania. She does not have anything to say about it. The press does not report my mother or Mrs Brown up the road. It reports us, and much of what goes in those newspapers comes from us in a system in which we are given parliamentary privilege, that is, the right not to be sued when we say anything that could be defamatory or slanderous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It comes back to us. The reputation of politicians is very important to the reputation and survival of the democratic political system. There is no doubt that from time to time Ministers in this place who transgress should be put under the microscope and examined. If there appears to be a prima facie case, then they should be censured. That is a fine point of judgment to make. There should be a prima facie case to justify a censure motion against a Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the three points in the Opposition's censure motion, I particularly want to refer to Mr Greg Symons. Greg Symons is not a convicted criminal. I remind the Senate that Greg Symons has been charged with an offence or a series of offences. There has been no conviction.<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Precisely. That is the second point that I make about the principles that we are casually flicking out the window year by year. What about the presumption of innocence? Our system is explicitly and implicitly based upon the notion that a person is innocent until proved guilty. This is decided generally before a jury of a person's peers. It may be an imperfect system but I think it is as close as we can get to a workable and fair system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So Greg Symons is not a convicted criminal; nor are some of the other people whom Senator Baume mentioned in his panoply of villains who, according to Senator Baume, Senator Richardson has met in the past. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could go around every political party and find out what went on in a senator's pre-selection manoeuvres. As far as I know, all political parties seem to suffer from the same problem. There seem to be too many people for too few jobs. Therefore, the nudging and elbowing as people move to gather the ball and to kick a goal tends to get a little fiercer the closer one gets to the ball and the closer one gets to the goal. As my friend, Senator Ray, once said, `Politics is a bit like the Tour de France. You are wearing the yellow guernsey. You are out in front pedalling away but you know that you are getting older year by year. There is someone in the pack who is saying, "I am with you. Drink some of my lemonade. I will help you.

If we use that to convict Ministers in this place, to censure them and to make them resign, we would put ourselves in the position of being regarded as the muckraking mansion of Australia. I do not want us to be put into that position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will be leaving Parliament in probably a year's time&mdash;maybe before that. But the simple fact is that the system itself is all that we have. It is not perfect. It is up to us&mdash;we are the caretakers. When Senator Teague leaves in 10 years time, people will say, `Who was Senator Teague?'. The same will be said about Senator Baume. Most of my colleagues will still be here. In 20 years time they will say, `Which West was that?'. This will happen to Senator Bjelke-Petersen. We will all be gone. We will just be names on a list. But what survives in a sense, in a strange way, is this institution which is influenced by the way we channel competing interests and approach fairness; the way we try to redistribute things properly so that we can make decisions about this country. We undermine the institution ourselves&mdash;we have been doing so for a long time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there we have it. In the minds of many Opposition members, Greg Symons is already convicted&mdash;he is as guilty as all get out. In their minds he is as guilty as Lindy Chamberlain and all of the other people who we put behind bars on the basis of poor evidence and so on. We know that there are people still around who say, `Yes, guilty&mdash;we know that they are absolutely guilty. There is no proof&mdash;we do not need proof'. We cannot descend into that cesspool. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the first thing is that Senator Richardson did make a mistake. Quite frankly, it was a stupid mistake. It is the sort of mistake that any person in this place could make. One could think, `Oh, no, I think that may be correct. It is something out of which I have got no money. I have no shares.

Senator Panizza says, `And some people'&mdash;shock, horror!&mdash;`actually forget to put in their tax returns'. What a terrible thing to do! A lot of people do that&mdash;the high and the low; from Prime Ministers to the average Joe Blow in the street. They forget to do it too. It is not a criminal act. It is an oversight and a mistake that ought to be rectified immediately. Such a person will pay some financial penalty as no doubt the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating) did.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, it is easy to pick up weaknesses in the system and say, `Ah, we have got him now'. But what does it really prove in the end? It just drags us down. In years to come people will not know who was the victim and who was the accuser; who was the person who broke the rules and who was the person who was accusing. It all gets lost in history. But what does stay is the damaged institution of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So Senator Richardson did make a mistake about his directorship. He was right to say, `I made a silly mistake' because it was a silly mistake&mdash;some would say a stupid mistake. He has corrected that. But we are seeing guilt by association. Every time we talk to someone, travel anywhere in the world and meet other politicians and so on, are we going to say, `I would like to talk to that person over there. I would like to have him in my office because he has requested to see me. But I think I ought to run an Australian Federal Police check on him before I see him'? When we are at the races or the football and well-known racing personalities through to football punters come up to us, are we going to say, `Sorry, I don't want to meet him because he or she could be a potential criminal'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that we have to mix with all sorts of people in this society. Some of us are actually going to defend some people who might look as guilty as hell but who are, in fact, innocent. But the public may think they are guilty because there has been a campaign of innuendo against them. What are we going to do? Are we going to say, `I don't want to mix with that person. He cannot come to my office; he cannot put his case to me because, let's face it, his career may not be unblemished'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the simple fact is that Senator Richardson is being attacked on the basis of insubstantial evidence&mdash;evidence which does not justify the seriousness of a censure motion. In a sense, the precious time of this Parliament has been wasted. Surely a censure motion could have been based upon more substantive issues. For example, Senator Teague said, `Information was coming to us incrementally'. That is true. That is the way an Opposition generally gets its information. Bit by bit it pieces together the story. The story may be bad in terms of what the Government has done; the story might ultimately be good. But the simple fact is that one has to have sufficient proof. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the Opposition is at the stage where it has simply taken a few things and said, `These are good enough. Now we will move a censure motion because we need to do the Government some damage'. The simple fact is that the Opposition is not doing the Government damage, it is not doing Senator Richardson damage&mdash;it is damaging this Parliament and that is why I oppose the censure motion. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XF4">Senator CRICHTON-BROWNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry, I am now a Sustain man. Senator Walsh produced these documents as if they were some incriminating, corroborating evidence that I had some commercial arrangement with this man. I think at that point I also had a company in Lucerne. Certainly it was in a haven of some sort of tax advantage. He tabled these documents. I am not certain at that point he was not the Minister for Finance, but he made these allegations and assertions with scant regard for truth, honesty or reasonable endeavour.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a month beforehand, I had the same cheque butts. They were given to me like they were given to Senator Walsh by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> newspaper, except the cheque butts I had included a cheque butt which referred to Lionel Murphy and a diamond for his wife. Of course, I did not raise it because I knew that this man Moll, whoever he was, was seeking, for whatever reason which has never been clear, to smear members on both sides of the chamber. But when Senator Walsh tabled the cheque butts, he tabled them all save for the one that affected former Senator Lionel Murphy. Once he did that&mdash;surprise, surprise&mdash;the one I had in my drawer also materialised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next day there was a censure motion against the Minister for Finance&mdash;to my knowledge the first in the history of the Senate&mdash;and it was carried because of his misrepresentation by the combined vote of the National Party, the Liberal Party and the Democrats. I make no judgment about that conduct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following that, the then Attorney-General, slow as he had been previously to concern himself with proving my innocence&mdash;talk</PARA>
<PARA>about the onus of proof&mdash;immediately had the Commonwealth Police inquire into the allegations in respect of the cheque butt that touched upon the previous alleged commercial activities of Lionel Murphy. In due course, Senator Gareth Evans was able to report to the Senate that the document was a falsification, as were the documents in respect of myself. I already knew that, of course, because I checked with the National Bank of Australia, which had found the corresponding cheques in a warehouse in London but refused to disclose them to me because they were not related to me, not associated with me, and they were not drawn on my account or for my benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I was unable to clear my name until Senator Gareth Evans deemed it necessary to clear the good name of Senator Lionel Murphy. Whatever his motive was, ultimately the events passed. So I say to Senator Aulich that, when we are making value judgments about ascribing motive and levels of integrity and conduct, it behoves all of us to reflect upon the conduct of our colleagues. When we criticise those on the other side, let us have the decency and the honesty to stand up and criticise those on our own side whose standards and values we do not agree with and who may be judged to be driven by political expediency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard Senator Aulich refer to Lindy Chamberlain. Michael Chamberlain came down to Parliament and he came to see me. I said, `There is something uneasy and always has been about your case and that of your wife'. I said, `I do not have all the facts, but there is something instinctively that tells me that you and your wife are innocent'. He burst into tears and said, `Senator Crichton-Browne, you're the first senator that has even been prepared to talk to me'. I said, `I don't believe that. Here is a list of names of those on the other side who have always held themselves out as having the ideals of believing in innocence until proved guilty, those who I have judged in the past to take up causes of this nature'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I myself rang those Government senators. Not one of them was prepared to see Michael Chamberlain. I might tell the Senate, with no great credit, that there were a couple of my colleagues who are no longer here who also refused to see him. Their comment was, `He's as guilty as hell; why would we bother?'&mdash;a common theme on both sides, of which none of us ought to be particularly proud. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, and I well remember the work he did. There were three people who had some anxiety about this matter: me, Senator Boswell and, I think, Senator Bjelke-Petersen. Nobody else wanted to know about it. So, when we get very pompous or pontifical about these issues, we ought to reflect upon the conduct of our colleagues. Senator Walsh once said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it concerns me that there are reports that there are Australian shareholders in a merchant bank set up in Panama, which as we all know is a notorious haven for tax evasion, a bank with which the name of the notorious tax evader, Christo Moll, has been linked. However, it would be inappropriate for me to speculate as to whether these facts bear any relation to Senator Crichton-Browne's sojourn in Panama during his recent overseas trip.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the result of a question by Senator Peter Cook to the then Minister for Finance, Senator Peter Walsh. It was not a speech; it was simply a case of a sleazy slimy question having previously been invited by the then Minister for Finance to allow him to pour, as he used to say, `a bucket' over somebody else. So I say, with respect, I find it rather unctuous and pompous for the Government to be taking the high moral ground in respect of this motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to oppose this censure motion and to defend my friend Senator Richardson. I agree with a number of remarks that Senator Crichton-Browne made in the observations just concluded. If he is firmly committed to that view about the presumption of innocence and he has been nauseated by some of the cant and hypocrisy demonstrated in some of the contributions made by those opposite, he should join the Government in defeating this proposed censure motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight we have heard nothing but a group of pharisees opposite delivering sermons on righteous conduct. That is all that contributions from those opposite have amounted to because, quite simply, the censure motion is related to electoral politics and has nothing to do with ministerial conduct. I compliment you, Mr Acting Deputy President, for your contribution earlier and I also compliment Senator Cooney for his; both you and he focused upon those very factors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No element in the censure motion can be substantiated, not one. Each and every element that is contained in the proposed resolution may be refuted. Where the error was made, Senator Richardson conceded the mistake. He did not walk away from that. Very much in the Australian tradition, he conceded the error and apologised and said quite frankly that he had been wrong. But in no instance has there been wrongdoing. In no circumstance has evidence been presented by anyone in the debate tonight&mdash;in either House of Parliament&mdash;or by anyone outside, to suggest that impropriety has occurred. I listened earlier to Senator Teague talking about bullying and the like. There is no evidence of that at all. No-one bar Senator Teague has suggested that. There is not a scintilla of evidence to suggest impropriety or wrongdoing&mdash;none. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge that this is not a legal forum. This is a political arena where much broader rules obviously apply. But surely the rules of fair play ought to apply. There is nothing more basic in notions of fair play, as ought to be applied to everyone, not only within this Australian Senate chamber but also to every Australian, than the concept of the presumption of innocence&mdash;and that has really been sullied tonight. I do not know anything about the Symons case in the Marshall Islands. But I know that, whether under Australian law or United States law, there is a presumption of innocence, inherited from the British tradition which is so dear to those opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The claims made against Senator Richardson are simply false. I have no hesitation in saying that; I will not be contradicted. He did not abuse his ministerial authority. He has not committed any offence. I have tried to be as objective as I can on this issue, though it is very difficult because he is a close friend. I have known him for the best part of 20 years. I am pleased to defend Senator Richardson, to answer Senator Kemp's remarks earlier, in absolute terms. I am pleased to defend him comprehensively as a man of honour. That is not in doubt in my mind, and I know him better than anyone else present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cant and hypocrisy that has been apparent in this debate verges on the nauseating, particularly from New South Wales Liberals. My God!  We once talked about the Askin Government; we now talk about the Greiner Government. For goodness sake, the New South Wales Liberals talking about propriety represents the absolute nadir of Federal parliamentary performance in terms of simple cant and hypocrisy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real reason for the censure&mdash;and you are wise enough in the ways of the world to appreciate this, Mr Acting Deputy President&mdash;is related to electoral strategy and politics. Some opposite resent the fact that Senator Richardson is close to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). In the House of Representatives no-one comes close to the Prime Minister in terms of parliamentary performance. This is really an attack upon the Prime Minister by proxy. That is what it is designed to achieve: to do some damage to the Government overall and to the Prime Minister in particular by attacking someone to whom he is close. It is not the first time it has happened. I cannot see that it will work, and I have defended Senator Richardson over the years in much more difficult forums than this. I do not believe this strategy will work. Senator Teague in his remarks earlier really did expose the vulnerable flank of the Opposition. Senator Teague is normally a very reasonable man&mdash;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BS4">Senator LOOSLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Within limits, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade observes. Within limits, Senator Teague is a very reasonable man, but he exposed a very vulnerable flank on the part of the coalition when he talked about Senator Richardson's role in election victories for the Labor Government in the late 1980s and around 1990. There is no question that a number of people opposite resent the Senator's influence and they resent his judgment and capacity, which has really been one of the elements that have made the difference in Australian politics in the 1980s, with the Federal Labor Governments of Bob Hawke and Paul Keating becoming the norms as has never occurred before in the country's history. That really is the core of the censure motion moved tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to pose one question, for every senator to think about in his or her mind, by way of an elementary test with respect to whether this censure motion is worth supporting. Has it been suggested by anyone opposite that on the three claims made there has been any adverse or detrimental impact upon public policy? Has the Government of Australia been affected? Has legislation been changed or altered? Has public policy been influenced by Senator Richardson in any wrong or mischievous way?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The answer to those questions is in the negative. No-one has suggested that there has been any impact upon public policy at all. No decision of the Government has been changed as a result of these claims. I think the claims fall down as a matter of logic. The censure motion falls down by way of that elementary test. The impact on public policy is nil, it is nought; it has been nothing and remains so. The sum total of the claims made against Senator Richardson is zero. The motion fails that elementary test, and for that reason should be defeated. </PARA>

This had the effect&mdash;through the nexus between the salaries of members of the Commission and Judges of the Federal Court&mdash;of proposing an increase of 14.3 per cent for members of the Commission. The Government responded by deciding that the remuneration of Judges should be raised by 6 per cent with effect from 1 July 1990 and another 6 per cent with effect from 1 January 1991. In the prevailing climate of recognition of the need for wage restraint by all in the community, the Government decided further that this should be varied: members of the Commission would receive the first stage of the increase but, since the Commission's structure should undergo the same process of review that it was overseeing in other public institutions, the second stage of the increase should be withheld pending this process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In November 1990, following the robust discussion which followed these decisions, the Government established a review of the structure and remuneration of members of the Commission. The review was conducted by an eminent group: Mr Gerry Gleeson AC, former head of the NSW Premiers Department; Justice Trevor Olsson of the South Australian Supreme Court; and Professor Alan Fels, Chairman of the Prices Surveillance Authority. The terms of reference for the review included that regard had to be had (among other things) for the central role of the Commission in industrial relations, its developing relations with state tribunals and the need to maintain its independence and effectiveness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report of the review was presented to the Government on 1 March 1991. Its recommendations included introduction of two new levels within the Commission's structure&mdash;a Vice President and Senior Deputy President&mdash;and a revised structure of salaries. On 20 March 1991, the Government announced that it had accepted the recommendations of the review and that they would form the basis of a submission to the Remuneration Tribunal on the remuneration of members of the Commission. The Government forwarded a submission to the Tribunal on 28 March 1991 and a supplementary submission on 8 May 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliament passed amendments to the Industrial Relations Act 1988 to establish the new Commission structure in May 1991. In my second reading speech, I stated:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The Government has accepted all of the Committee's recommendations as they provide a sound basis on which to strengthen the Commission's structure and to put it in a better position to address its increasing range of responsibilities and the wider scope of its jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"These reforms will complement the initiatives which the Government took in framing the Industrial Relations Act to enable the Commission to exercise a broader jurisdiction. It will also facilitate the increasing co-operation between the Commission and its State counterparts, including through members of each being commissioned to hold office on both the Federal and State Tribunals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 30 November 1991, six months having elapsed after the granting of Royal Assent, the amending legislation came into effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Remuneration Tribunal forwarded its determination of remuneration for members of the Commission on 24 December 1991. This determination containing technical defects, the Tribunal indicated that a further determination had to be issued. The Government received this further determination on 9 March 1992. In these determinations, the Tribunal failed to establish salary rates for the new offices and it maintained the previous relativities between the various levels in the Commission structure. The Tribunal indicated that it would not determine remuneration for the new offices until persons were appointed to them and the duties to be performed established.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thus, the Tribunal's determinations prevented establishment of a salary structure for positions which, following the Parliament's decisions on the matter, had come into existence nearly six months earlier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, it is the Government's view that, like those who come before it, the Commission must be able to respond to evolving developments in the industrial relations environment as it adapts to the change taking place in the broad economy. In particular, the Commission must be able to facilitate the increasing co-operation between Federal and State Tribunals. The new offices, and the consequent revised relativities for the other offices of the Commission, are critical for the creation of a more appropriate and effective structure for the Commission. In its amendments to the Industrial Relations Act last year, the Parliament accepted this view. Recruiting persons to fill the new offices, however, cannot be done until the salaries have been set.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, let me sum up for the benefit of Honourable Senators. An eminent committee has conducted a full and objective review of the structure and remuneration of members of the Commission. The Government accepted the proposals of the committee. The Parliament agreed with the Government's decision and acted to create the structure which the committee proposed for the Commission. The Remuneration Tribunal has failed to establish salaries for the new structure which the Parliament has created. Recruiting persons to fill the new offices in this new structure cannot be done until the salaries for these new offices have been set. An impasse has been created, therefore, which the Government must resolve so that the will of the Parliament can be carried out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill proposes the means by which this can be done. It proposes to establish salaries and relativities with judicial salaries as the basis for future remuneration for the five levels of office-holders on the Commission. This is in line with the recommendations of the Gleeson Committee which were accepted by the Government and endorsed by the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill proposes that the salary for the office of President of the Commission should continue to be equivalent to that of the Chief Justice of the Federal Court. The salary rate for the office of Senior Deputy President will become the benchmark for the internal salary relativities in the new Commission structure. It will be equated with that for a Judge of the Federal Court. It is proposed that the salary for the office of Vice President of the Commission should be three per cent higher than that for a Senior Deputy President; for the office of Deputy President, 95 per cent of that for a Senior Deputy President; and for the office of Commissioner, 70 per cent of that for a Deputy President.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consistent with the Gleeson Committee report, the Government proposes to seek advice at regular intervals about the appropriateness of the relativities established by the nexus between salaries of members of the Commission and those of Judges of the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, this Bill also proposes to modify the determination of the Remuneration Tribunal relating to Vice-Chancellors and deputy Vice-Chancellors of universities within the responsibility of the Commonwealth. The reason for this is the concern which the Government had at the salary levels which the Tribunal has proposed for this group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The salary levels proposed would have given this group significantly greater increases than those received by other public sector executives under the Structural Efficiency Principle. Moreover, the Tribunal's determination anticipated a further review of the remuneration of heads of departments and other senior public sector executives in advance of any consideration by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government acknowledges the significant restructuring which institutions of higher education have undergone and the impact this has had on the work of Vice-Chancellors. This restructuring and its effects, however, have been no greater than that which has occurred elsewhere in the public sector at the Senior Executive Service level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill introduces new rates for Vice-Chancellors of Commonwealth institutions and their deputies consistent with those granted to university academic staffs and senior public servants. There will be appropriate adjustments to funding for non-Commonwealth institutions to reflect this decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, I now turn to the question of the timing of these salary increases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The salaries proposed in this Bill for Commissioners of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and for Vice-Chancellors and their deputies will take effect from the date the Act receives Royal Assent. This group has already received the salaries proposed by the Remuneration Tribunal from 1 January 1991. The position for Presidential Members of the Commission is somewhat different because the Tribunal's determination does not take effect until 15 Parliamentary sitting days after tabling. To ensure fairness to all concerned, the Government proposes that the new salary levels for Presidential members of the Commission should also take effect from 1 January 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, I have referred to the proposal to change the qualifications for appointment to chair the Remuneration Tribunal. The details are as follows. Subsection 4(6) of the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973 currently restricts appointment to the position of Chairperson of the Tribunal to a person who is a Judge or a retired Judge of a State Court or one who is qualified for appointment as a Judge of a State Court. This provision is not considered appropriate because of the conflict created as a result of arrangements agreed by the Commonwealth and States to prevent leapfrogging between federal and state judicial salaries. Because of these arrangements, it could be implied that the Chairperson of the Tribunal, if a Judge of a State Court, could be in a position to influence his or her own remuneration. This provision also has the effect of restricting the field of candidates for appointment to the position. This Bill therefore proposes to remove this qualification for the position of Chairperson of the Tribunal. Persons with legal qualifications will not be precluded from appointment by this action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also proposes three minor technical amendments to the Act. They relate to the validity of certain determinations, the inclusion of an additional office within the jurisdiction of the Remuneration Tribunal, and the restoration of an annual leave loading for particular office-holders. The details of these proposed minor amendments are contained in the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Supplementation for additional expenditure in 1991-92 has already been provided to cover the salary increases determined by the Tribunal. The rates proposed in this Bill will reduce the call on the level of supplementation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, I would like to finish my remarks with two observations. They concern, first, the role of the Parliament in relation to determinations by the Remuneration Tribunal and, second, the standing and independence of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is alleged in some quarters that members of the Remuneration Tribunal have been offended by the fact that its most recent determination has not been accepted. The Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973 which established the Tribunal explicitly provides for its determinations to be disallowed if the Parliament so wishes. Indeed, Parliament disallowed the very first determinations the Tribunal made in 1974. Its determinations have been overturned or modified seven times since then, not only in relation to the remuneration of Members of Parliament but also of other groups within the Tribunal's jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government must accept the ultimate responsibility for the effects of Tribunal determinations. It is therefore appropriate that it retain the right to disallow or modify these determinations. Indeed, the Opposition acknowledged this as recently as 1990 when Senator Durack stated in the Senate in debate on the Remuneration and Allowances Bill 1990:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"For many reasons the Opposition has decided that it will not oppose this legislation. It simply wishes to reiterate the firm view that it takes in relation to the proper course of action for governments to take. When all is said and done, the ultimate decision in matters of this sort has to be made by the Government. It has to take the ultimate responsibility and it is not for oppositions to seek by some means or other to change that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also alleged in some quarters that the Government's decision not to accept the Tribunal's most recent determinations somehow threatens the independence not only of the Tribunal but also of the Commission itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sec. 72 (iii) of the Constitution states that the Justices of the High Court and other courts created by the Parliament "shall receive such remuneration as the Parliament may fix: but the remuneration shall not be diminished during their continuance in office."  Is it seriously suggested that this constitutional duty of the Parliament threatens the independence of the judiciary either in fact or appearance?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the Tribunal was established, decisions about the remuneration of all Federal Judges and members of the federal industrial tribunal were made by Cabinet on the advice of a very small committee of senior public servants. Is it suggested that this compromised the independence of such eminent Australians as Sir Owen Dixon or Sir Richard Kirby?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, to ask these questions is to answer them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Industrial Relations Commission has&mdash;and should continue to keep&mdash;a central role in the industrial and economic life of the nation. The Government has no time for the argument that it should be sidelined and made irrelevant to our industrial and economic wellbeing. It is a crucial influence on our economic policy-making and on our capacity to undergo economic reform. It has helped maintain industrial harmony and stability. It has provided access to wage justice for Australian workers, particularly those without power in the marketplace. Its manifest fairness and competence are the reasons why the tribunal system has been so strongly supported so widely and for so long. The Government's support for the standing, credibility and independence of the Commission remains as clear and as strong as it has ever been.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In December 1991 the Parliament passed legislation ensuring the highest standards of accountability in the Australian political process. The funding and disclosure provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act were substantially enhanced to provide for comprehensive financial disclosure by political and third parties. These major changes to our electoral system were brought about with the decisive support of all members of the Parliament .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of the amendments the Act now imposes an obligation upon registered political parties to lodge annual returns of all income, expenditure and debts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Act also requires far greater accountability from `third parties' who participate in the electoral process by requiring the disclosure of gifts made by them to political parties. The Australian Electoral Commission has also been given enhanced powers to conduct random spot audits to ensure compliance with the disclosure provisions and further reporting powers in relation to such audits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The operation of the enhanced disclosure scheme came into effect immediately upon passage of the amendments on 19 December 1991. Over the ensuing period the full implications of the amended regime have become apparent, as political and third parties and the Australian Electoral Commission have examined closely the procedural requirements needed to be taken to comply with the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has become clear that certain of the enhanced requirements&mdash;particularly those dealing with annual political party returns will cause extreme administrative difficulties for political parties, particularly at the volunteer officer and branch level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has therefore reviewed the disclosure provisions to determine whether steps could be taken to reduce the administrative burden upon political parties whilst preserving the primary objective of full disclosure and transparency of the political process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulties identified do not arise from the requirement to record and disclose the total amounts  received, paid or owed by political parties. The changes the Government proposes in this Bill will not effect this important requirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major administrative burden upon political parties arises out of an obligation to record certain other information in respect to every single transaction entered into by the party and its constituent organs, much of which will not ultimately need to be disclosed. This arises because in addition to disclosing all income, expenditure and debts of the party, the annual returns must identify every person or organisation who pays to, receives from or is owed by the party a total annual amount of $1,500 or more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The $1,500 limit set by the Parliament which triggers the identification requirement is reasonable and justifiable. However, the requirement is cast in absolute terms and therefore encompasses all amounts received, paid or owed to the party, including small and insignificant sums.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to comply with the letter of the law political parties will be required to keep records of the identity of everyone from whom they receive, or to whom they pay or owe any amount and to collate all of these amounts annually to determine whether an individual's identity must be disclosed. This will include both small and large single amounts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will include one dollar raffle tickets, and thousand dollar donations, and for the purpose of the identification requirement, will not make any administrative distinction between them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All political parties in Australia are voluntary bodies which rely on their membership for the organisation of party activities in the majority of circumstances. This is especially so at the local branch level. Whilst the major political parties employ full time office holders and organisational staff, much of the initial administrative burden of recording details of financial transactions will fall at the branch level. It is unrealistic to expect voluntary office holders to be able to comply with these requirements. It is, as a result, also unrealistic to expect the Agents of Registered Political Parties to be able to ensure that complete returns are lodged with regard to the identification requirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill therefore proposes the following response to these administrative difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Division 5A of Part XX of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 which provides for annual returns by registered political parties will be repealed and replaced by a revised Division 5A. The new provision will continue to require annual returns by all Registered Political Parties of the total amounts received, paid or owed by or on  behalf of the party during the reporting year. Regulations will be able to be made requiring a breakdown of the total amounts into sub totals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The disclosure requirements must embrace all units of political parties to prevent avoidance. However, the current provisions could be modified to enable parties latitude in respect of minor expenditure or income whilst ensuring significant transactions and those involved in them are still reported. Furthermore, the enhanced random auditing power of the Electoral Commission will be available to it to enforce compliance with the disclosure scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new Division 5A will require parties to report the particulars, including the name and address, of any individual from whom they receive a total amount of $1500 or more during the reporting year. However, parties will not be required to count towards any total amount received by an individual, amounts of less than $100 received from a fundraising event. In practice whilst party units conducting such events will need to record the total amount received, they will not need to attribute amounts of less than $100 to their source for recording purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amounts paid by political parties will be treated in a similar way. Whilst particulars will need to be reported, of any individual to whom the party pays total amounts of $1,500 or more in the reporting year, single items of expenditure of $100 or more will not be required to be counted towards the total amount for any individual or organisation. In addition, to protect the legitimate privacy concerns of employees of political parties, amounts paid by way of bona fide salaries or employment related entitlements will not need to be counted for the purposes of the identification requirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As debts are not normally incurred for or on behalf of parties in respect of similar insignificant amounts, no corresponding provisions are necessary in the case of amounts owed by political parties and the requirement to disclose the identity of those to whom a party owes $1,500 or more has not been altered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The particulars required to be disclosed in respect of individuals or organisations to be identified in returns will also be amended. The Bill will standardise these particulars so that they are common throughout the various disclosure requirements in the Act. Additional information will be required regarding the identity of persons who are in positions of control of trusts and unincorporated associations. In respect of the latter the names and addresses of the members of the executive committee, howsoever described, will be required. This will assist the Australian Electoral Commission in its investigations and enforcement of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this regard a separate definition of `Registered  Industrial Organisation' encompassing all such organisations registered under the relevant Commonwealth or State Industrial Relations legislation will be inserted in the Act. As the names and addresses of the executives of such organisations are available publicly through the relevant Register of Industrial Organisations in the same way as Directors of Companies can be identified by reference to registered Company Records, these particulars will not be required to be included in returns under the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the immediate introduction of the enhanced disclosure requirements, a significant level of uncertainty as to the obligations they impose upon participants in the political process has arisen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the disclosure requirements will be further amended by this Bill, it would be unreasonable to expect compliance with the existing requirements, in the form of returns for the period from 19 December 1991 until 30 June 1992. Sufficient records enabling compliance with the existing provisions are unlikely to have been kept due to ignorance of the extent of the disclosure obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new Division 5A will therefore apply prospectively from 1 July 1992 and the first annual return required by the Division will cover the 1992-93 financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similar transitional provisions will be made with respect to the amended disclosure requirements in section 305 and sections 308 and 309 of the Act relating to third party reporting of expenditure for political purposes and electoral expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 314AA currently requires that registered political party's annual returns must be lodged within eight weeks of the end of the financial year. Previously political parties had been given 20 weeks following general elections to lodge returns in respect of disclosable gifts and expenditure received and incurred during the disclosure period, or in layman's terms, the period from the previous election until the election just held. As the new regime requires disclosure of far greater detail, albeit on a more regular basis, it is reasonable to afford political parties the same reporting period as applied to the more limited previous disclosure requirements. Proposed new Division 5A will incorporate a 20-week reporting period. This will alleviate the difficulties that would arise where an election is called during the period just preceding or following the end of the financial year. Such an election would of course reduce substantially, the resources available to parties to prepare disclosure returns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently the Act requires the Electoral Commission to process the annual party returns and make them available for public inspection within 4 weeks of the end of the reporting period. To ensure the Commission has adequate time to collate and prepare the returns, this period will  be extended until the end of January each year, a period of approximately 10 weeks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, further amendments proposed by this Bill will tighten the operation of the disclosure scheme and close minor potential loopholes which have been identified since the passage of the 1991 amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 305 of the Act requires disclosure of expenditure incurred for political purposes. This includes the making of certain gifts to political parties. Where a third party makes a gift to a political party equal to or exceeding $1,000, the third party must disclose all gifts received by them during the disclosure period, equal to or exceeding $1,000. However, the initial gift to the political party which triggers the obligation to disclose gifts received, is limited to gifts made on the condition that they be used for a purpose related to an election. This in effect preserves the distinction between gifts for electoral and non electoral purposes which was removed from the other disclosure requirements in the Act by the 1991 amendments. The Bill will amend section 305 to remove this distinction thus ensuring consistency throughout the disclosure scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 309 of the Act requires the disclosure of electoral expenditure which is defined in section 308. Both sections were amended by the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Act 1991 to require disclosure by the donor, of gifts to political parties, candidates and other organisations or persons specified in the gazette by the Electoral Commission. Previously section 308 related to types of expenditure incurred during the relevant election period. The intention behind the amendments to section 308 was that they apply to gifts received at all times during the disclosure period. The changes made to the Act in 1991 do not achieve this result with sufficient certainty or clarity. This is primarily because the other types of expenditure covered by section 308 relate solely to election period expenditure. To ensure that the intention is unambiguously applied the Act will be amended to create a separate reporting requirement for third party gifts received during the relevant disclosure period to be included in proposed section 305A. This will ensure that third parties must disclose financial relationships with political parties and candidates as well as their direct participation in the political process through electoral expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 309 which requires the disclosure of electoral expenditure, was amended by the 1991 Act to allow regulations to be made which prescribed amounts under which disclosure of gifts to candidates, political parties or prescribed organisations would not be required. Proposed section 305A will incorporate these amounts which have been determined so as to reflect consistency with the other requirements of the disclosure scheme. The amounts included in section 305A are $4500 for gifts to political  parties, $200 for candidates and $1000 for prescribed third parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 318 of the Act enables persons required to lodge disclosure returns, but who are unable to do so completely because they do not possess and cannot obtain relevant information, to inform the Electoral Commission of their inability and to identify any person they have reasonable grounds to believe is able to provide the Commission with the information. These steps protect the person required to lodge returns from liability for failure to comply with the disclosure requirements. The section does not currently apply to Division 5A and therefore party agents are not presently able to avail themselves of its protection with regards to incomplete annual party returns. There is no justifiable reason for exempting these returns from the operation of section 318. The Bill will correct this anomaly.</PARA>

<PARA>The Bill now before the Senate is another significant step along the path of fundamental reform initiated by the Government since taking office in 1983: reform which is transforming Australia's industrial relations landscape. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measures it proposes exemplify this Government's approach to industrial relations reform, as distinct from the Opposition's alternative. The fundamental elements of our approach are:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">a flexible industrial relations system that&mdash;at the same time&mdash;enhances efficiency and equity at the workplace and responds to national macro-economic imperatives;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">the existence of democratic organisations of employees and employers to represent the interests of their members, as in all truly free societies;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">a role for public institutions, notably independent industrial tribunals, to provide social protections through the safety net provided by an effective award system and to contribute to industrial stability through the machinery of conciliation and arbitration;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">consultation and cooperation between workers, their unions and employers as essential ways to ensure that industrial reform and workplace changes are best framed and implemented on a sustainable basis; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">a legitimate and necessary government role in reforms through supportive policies and labour market programs to promote desired outcomes at the national, industry and enterprise levels. Abandoning the reform process to the whims of the market through deregulation would be counterproductive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This practical approach, founded on firm social democratic values, is directed toward delivering the best and fairest economic outcomes for Australia. It recognises the vital role that our industrial relations institutions and practices have to play in achieving these outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A best and fairest economy is marked by internal cohesiveness, flexibility, optimum development of the skills and productive performance of the people and sustained growth in living standards with a fair distribution of national incomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, since 1983 we have set out systematically to pursue these objectives by applying Labor's approach to delivering practical reforms:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">we have applied a flexible accord wages policy responsive to Australia's economic circumstances. This has delivered responsible wage outcomes, a dramatic expansion in employment through the 1980s, very low inflation and record low levels of industrial disputation;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">we have improved the legislative framework governing the federal industrial relations system;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">we have strongly supported the overhaul of award and trade union structures in Australia, through industrial relations policies, workplace reform programs and assistance for union rationalisation. We are driving fundamental complementary reforms in education and training;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">we are managing and overseeing a transformation of industrial attitudes and behaviour, away from the adversarial relationships of the past and towards the cooperative approach that is most conducive to a new workplace culture. Our catalytic programs have helped to accelerate and extend this transformation through wider acceptance of the need for workplace reform and the adoption of international best practice in Australian firms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This careful and sustained reform process has meant drawing together the industrial parties, with the tribunals, to work as One Nation. It has necessarily rejected the `Big Bang' type of confrontationist approach which would bring confrontation back to the workplace, subvert the `umpire' role of the independent tribunals, and substitute blind reliance on market forces for wages policy and reform programs. The deregulationist agenda&mdash;preoccupied solely with activity at the enterprise level, with negative cost cutting to the exclusion of industry and national strategies&mdash;would lead to the exploitation of the vulnerable and disadvantaged in the community. This would be at the expense of the longer-term dynamic strategies&mdash;implemented realistically and co-operatively&mdash;which are needed for genuine flexibility and development of a mobile, highly skilled work force. Yet these are the pre-requisite conditions to produce in Australia the high wage, high productivity type of economy which dominates world markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government proposes through this Bill to extend the process of practical reform that builds on the achievements already made through our approach. We believe that is the priority, not only of Australian workers and their unions, but also of the great bulk of the business community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the main proposals in the Bill. It has five main elements:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">a fundamental revision of the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act 1988 to facilitate and encourage workplace bargaining. The parties to a dispute within the jurisdiction of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission will be enabled to reach agreement on terms to settle the dispute and to have the agreement certified by the Commission to operate as an award;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">a provision to enable the Commission to prevent or settle disputes over contract arrangements and review sham or unfair contracts;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">conferral of specific duties on the office of Vice-President of the Commission in relation to registered organisations of employers and workers;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">simpler processes for the recovery of unpaid award wages; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">improved machinery for national consultation on industrial relations matters. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Certified Agreements</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key aim of the new certified agreements provisions is to facilitate workplace bargaining agreements that boost productivity and improve the living standards of workers. There is now consensus in Australia on the need to focus industrial relations more directly on the enterprise and workplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The participants in our system are moving steadily towards accepting greater responsibility for finding their own solutions to industrial differences, in a way which is constructive and produces lasting benefits for employers, workers and the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes made by the Industrial Relations Act in 1988 through the section 115 provision for certified agreements have been recognised as an important step forward. A certified agreement operates as a fixed term, `closed' award for its agreed specified period and does not necessarily have to conform with national wage principles. Until recently, however, all sides&mdash;including the Commission&mdash;have shown a very cautious attitude towards certified agreements. In practice, and notwithstanding some notable innovative arrangements such as at ICI, there have been relatively few agreements presented for certification. We are clearly past the uncertainties about the benefits of more decentralised bargaining and it is obvious that, for various reasons, the provisions are too restrictive in their operation for current needs. Accordingly, last October in a statement to the Senate, I foreshadowed legislative action to address the issue. The Commission, in its national wage decision later that month, also referred to some difficulties in the provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed legislation thus reflects experience with more decentralised bargaining and the existing provisions. Essentially, we are proposing that, within the scope of the constitutional conciliation and arbitration power, parties to a dispute should be able to settle their differences and prevent future disputes with greater confidence that their agreement will be accepted for certification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Greater prominence will be given to certified agreements. A new division will be included in the Act to deal with such agreements. The division will be prefaced by a clause specifying that the objects of the division are to facilitate the making and certifying of agreements and to encourage their use in the prevention and settlement of disputes. The Commission will be required to perform its functions under the new division in a way which furthers these objects as far as practicable. The intended effect of these provisions is to ensure that certified agreements are available as a real alternative to the mainstream award system and not reserved for exceptional circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be simple criteria for certification: no disadvantage to employees; the inclusion of dispute-settling provisions; and consultation by unions with their affected members about the agreement. If an agreement applies to a single business&mdash;including a project or joint venture&mdash;part of a single business or a single workplace, there must be a single bargaining unit comprising all relevant unions, though the Commission will be able to permit exceptions.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A key element of the new certified agreements provisions is that a certified agreement must not disadvantage the employees it covers, in respect of their terms and conditions of employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The circumstances in which the Commission may find that an agreement will disadvantage employees are specified. It must first consider whether certification would result in the reduction of employment entitlements and protections for employees covered by the agreement, under an award or under any other law that it considers relevant. If it judges that such a reduction would occur, it must consider whether or not the reduction is contrary to the public interest, in the context of the terms and conditions of those employees considered as a whole. The provision is not intended to operate in a way to reduce well established and accepted standards which apply across the community, such as maternity leave, standard hours of work, parental leave, minimum rates of pay, termination change and redundancy provisions and superannuation. This test is designed to allow some flexibility in the arrangements which parties may include in a certified agreement, but to prevent reductions in protections or entitlements if they are unfair or against the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commission will be able to refuse to certify an agreement which applies more widely than to a single business if, as now, it considers the agreement to be contrary to the public interest. It will only have such a discretion for an agreement which applies to a single business, part of such a business or a single workplace if the Minister for Industrial Relations applies to have the agreement's effect on the public interest considered. This Ministerial power will operate only for 18 months as a safeguard while the operation of the new provisions becomes established. In these circumstances, an agreement may be refused certification if it is found substantially to jeopardise the public interest. Similar conditions will apply to the Commission's powers to review an agreement's operation once certified. I should emphasise that the Ministerial power is not expected to be used in any but the most extreme circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A certified agreement will still be variable only during its specified period of operation on limited grounds, reflecting the agreement's `closed' nature. Under the new provisions, where parties agree, they will be able to extend the period of operation of a certified agreement. It is also proposed to change the arrangements which apply after agreements reach the end of their specified period of operation. At present, they cease to have effect after expiry. This has caused some difficulty. It is proposed that, after their specified term expires, they shall continue to operate. But they should be subject to the same rules as other awards. Alternatively, they can be replaced by a new agreement or a mainstream award or simply cancelled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new division will also contain a number of changes designed to streamline procedures for the certification of agreements and to facilitate their use. There is now a requirement that a Full Bench must deal with agreements which the President considers to be inconsistent with general wage fixing principles. This will be removed. So will the requirement prohibiting a certified agreement being based on the terms of another certified agreement. Where the Commission has grounds for refusing to certify an agreement, it may permit parties to vary the agreement to make it certifiable or it may certify the agreement subject to undertakings as to its operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new provisions will represent a more complete approach to certified agreements, reflecting the Government's expectation that the parties will increasingly seek to have their own arrangements accepted and given effect in the Federal system. They are designed to accelerate workplace reforms and lift our productivity performance. I emphasise that this will be undertaken within an effective framework which provides for best practice workplace bargaining, which ensures fairness and which maintains and consolidates appropriate roles for employers, unions and tribunals in the process. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Independent Contractors</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>The Bill proposes to amend the Act to:</PARA>
<PARA>.give the Commission power to review unfair contracts for the performance of work by independent contractors;</PARA>
<PARA>.give the Commission power to prevent or settle disputes over the use of independent contractors; and</PARA>
<PARA>.give independent contractors the choice of joining a federally registered union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been considerable misunderstanding of the Government's legislative proposals regarding independent contractors, based either on misinformation or unwillingness to consider them. Action is necessary in this area because, in a modern economy, it is unrealistic to limit the jurisdiction of the national industrial tribunal strictly to matters involving only employees in the strict legal sense. Notably, the High Court has found that the principal constitutional power in respect of industrial disputes is not so limited. There can be no credible justification for so limiting the prevention and settlement of industrial relations problems. They should be addressed on their merits by an expert industrial tribunal; not left as a source of industrial friction and injustice, without remedy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Experience has shown that there are many workers who are not employees in the strict legal sense but who are in an extremely vulnerable position, with minimal bargaining power or legal protection. Regrettably, some employers have sought to avoid award requirements and other protections of employees by arrangements under which their workers are termed independent contractors. In some cases, these arrangements have been exposed as shams. In other cases, legal technicalities could exclude such a finding and prevent the workers' position being protected by an industrial tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are situations where new ways of performing work are considered and in which traditional employment arrangements have been called into question. Industrial disputes may be generated as a result. At present there is no effective means at the Federal level to permit the merits of the case to be impartially examined by the Commission. The Government considers it far more satisfactory to allow such an examination, so that the justification for new arrangements can be measured and judged objectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The primary aim of the proposed changes is to ensure the fair treatment of workers, whether they are employees or independent contractors, to protect responsible employers and consequently to promote good industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has struck a balance between protecting the interests of genuine self-employed entrepreneurs and protecting from exploitation workers with limited bargaining power. Its primary objective is to ensure that workers, particularly those whose employment status is ambiguous, are not exploited. No fair-minded person could support the concept of people working under contrived, unfair contracts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposals concerning contractors do not proceed on the basis that any class of worker is to be favoured over another; rather that all people performing work are entitled to be treated fairly. They are not an attack on genuine and efficient independent contracting arrangements. Nor are they an illegitimate extension of trade union power. They are a practical and fair response to real difficulties and disputes in the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They provide a way to resolve industrial friction on the merits of the case, without resort to the civil courts and the attendant costs and delays, or the unrestrained abuse of pressure tactics. They rely on the good sense of the Commission to find appropriate ways to settle disputes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The term `independent contractor' covers individuals who are performing work under a contract for services as opposed to employees who perform work under a contract of service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In dealing with disputes over the use of independent contractors, the Commission will be required to take into account a number of relevant factors. These will include cost and efficiency, and custom and practice in the industry. The Commission will also have to consider the fairness of the remuneration, the effect on the development of skills in the industry of using independent contractors, and whether or not the arrangements are merely a device to avoid award obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Allowing independent contractors to join federally registered unions is not novel. Some independent contractors do so now. In addition, a union will not be able to seek among independent contractors a wider class of members than it may seek among employees. The protection available to independent contractors under the Act will continue to apply, and is to be extended to make it clear that an independent contractor may not be compelled to join a union nor discriminated against on account of membership or non-membership of a union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Independent contractors will not be made into employees, and will not be subject to the award system generally. The new arrangements will operate only on a case by case basis, not on a general or class action basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the unfair contracts review procedure is a more limited procedure than that now available under some State laws. Such a procedure has existed in New South Wales for many years, and has recently been carried over by the Greiner Government into the New South Wales Industrial Relations Act 1991. The procedure proposed in this Bill will only operate in respect of a limited class of unfair contracts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Naturally, in developing these proposals, the Government has taken the needs of industry into account, together with those of other relevant interests. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Vice-Presidential Duties</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An increasingly important area of the work of the Commission relates to registered organisations of employers and employees. There are, for example, complex questions arising in relation to the rationalisation of unions in the federal system, through amalgamations, changes in coverage and associated rule alterations. At present, this area of work is undertaken by presidential members designated for the purpose by the President. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reflecting the importance, complexity and amount of such work, it is proposed that the Act be amended so that a specific panel responsible for this area is formed in the Commission, headed by the Vice-President. The panel will comprise the Vice-President and presidential members designated by the President. All panel members will be available for other duties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The establishment of the new panel is similar to the arrangements in the Act by which industry panels are established for the purposes of preventing and settling disputes in particular industries. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Small Claims</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill will make it easier for employees to recover relatively small amounts of money to which they are entitled under awards. This will provide a more efficient method of enforcing awards in situations where complex legal procedures and legal representation are unnecessary. A virtually identical scheme already exists in New South Wales for small claims under State awards. Similar schemes are commonplace for consumer claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new small claims system will apply to claims brought in magistrates' courts for amounts up to $5,000. The Government will be able to increase this amount by regulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main features of this new system will be exclusion of legal representation, relaxation of the rules of evidence and overcoming of technicalities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present small but blatant breaches of award obligations can occur without it being worthwhile for employees to incur the legal expenses necessary to enforce their award entitlements. These small claims typically involve no difficult questions of legal interpretation, making the involvement of lawyers an unnecessary complication and expense. It is proposed that representation by a barrister or solicitor will not be allowed unless the magistrate decides to allow it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also proposes to give the Government power to make regulations restricting the magistrate's discretion to allow legal representation. For example, legal representation could be prohibited except when all the parties to the litigation agree to allow it. This is now the case under New South Wales legislation governing small claims under State awards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of constitutional restrictions, the Commonwealth can only restrict a State magistrate's power to allow legal representation if State legislation already imposes the same restriction on the relevant State courts. That is why the Bill provides for this to be done by regulation. The regulations will be prepared in consultation with States that have enacted relevant legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The regulations will also be able to ensure that officers of unions or employer groups will be allowed to appear in court to represent their members. The Commonwealth only has the constitutional power to do this if State legislation already includes comparable provisions governing the State jurisdiction of the relevant courts. This constitutional restriction will make it necessary for regulations to be made on a State-by-State basis, as for the regulations concerning legal representation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ensuring that parties to these cases can be represented by expert industrial advocates, rather than by barristers or solicitors, will help magistrates' courts to address the practical issues that arise in these cases. This is another aspect of making enforcement of awards a more efficient process. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Changes to Structure of NLCC Council</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final major proposal in the Bill is designed to encourage greater tripartite consultation on industrial relations and other employment matters of national concern. It is proposed to enhance the representative nature of the National Labour Consultative Council by widening its membership to include another employer representative. It also proposes to give the Minister power to invite other persons and bodies to be represented at meetings, as appropriate. The Bill amends the National Labour Consultative Council Act 1977 accordingly. </PARA>

This progress can only be sustained and maintained if all those involved can take part and reap the benefits. Its governing objectives therefore are fairness as well as efficiency. Its governing method is through co-operation and participation, rather than confrontation and division. In this way, the whole community gains the rewards. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government welcomes this comprehensive and informative report. The Committee's inquiry covered a very wide range of issues across the entire spectrum of Australia's relations with Papua New Guinea, and its Report contains many useful recommendations, most of which are consistent with the Government's current policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Management of Australia's diverse relationship with Papua New Guinea is one of the Government's major foreign policy priorities.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Committee notes, Australia's relations with Papua New Guinea have changed considerably since Papua New Guinea became a sovereign nation in 1975. Today, the relationship is one between independent and equal nations. It is a professional, business-like relationship which reflects the practical reality of relations between neighbouring countries with strong historical, social, economic and strategic ties. Australia's approach to the relationship is based on the principle of constructive commitment, whereby we seek to develop a mutually advantageous partnership.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Respect for the sovereignty and independence of Papua New Guinea and a wish to conduct relations as equals are the fundamental principles underlying the Government's policy approach to its relations with Papua New Guinea. The basic elements of this approach are clearly set out in the Joint Declaration of Principles Guiding Relations between Australia and Papua New Guinea. The signing of the Joint Declaration in December 1987 was a watershed in Australia's relations with Papua New Guinea, representing the closing off of one era and the opening up of another. The Joint Declaration sets out the basic principles of the modern relationship and provides a comprehensive framework for the development of the relationship in the future. The basic principles in the Joint Declaration are reflected in the 1989 Treaty on Development Co-operation and the 1991 Agreed Statement on Security Cooperation. Its objectives are also evident in the text of the revised Agreement on Trade and Commercial Relations (PATCRA II), signed in 1991, and the Agreement for the Protection and Promotion of Investments (APPI), signed in 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In keeping with the objectives of the Joint Declaration, the Government has pursued a policy which has as its basic tenet the belief that the direction of Papua New Guinea's political, social and economic development is a matter for its government and people to determine. The Government believes that lasting solutions to Papua New Guinea's problems must be found by Papua New Guinea and must be sustainable from its own resources. At the same time the Australian Government  has made clear that it remains firmly committed to a close and enduring relationship with Papua New Guinea. Primary responsibility for Papua New Guinea's development rests in the hands of Papua New Guineans, but when the PNG Government asks for Australia's assistance, the Government makes it clear that it is ready to cooperate to the fullest extent possible. Australia's role is to support, with advice and assistance, the decisions taken by Papua New Guinea about its future. Australia and Papua New Guinea are equal partners in the relationship and any support provided by Australia is given on that basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's approach to relations with Papua New Guinea is welcomed by the PNG Government. It is clearly understood by the PNG Government that Australia respects Papua New Guinea's sovereignty and independence but is not distancing or disengaging itself from the relationship, and that Australia remains willing to make a major contribution to Papua New Guinea's economic and social development. The Government will give priority to programs initiated by Papua New Guinea, which involve, where possible, provincial and local levels of governments, which can be sustained in the long term from the country's own resources and which are consistent with the traditions and cultural values of the Papua New Guinean people. In broad terms, the Government believes that Australia's assistance will be more effective  if it is directed towards helping the PNG Government build up its institutional capacities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the implementation of its policy towards Papua New Guinea the Government seeks to promote and protect Australia's interests while taking into account the needs of Papua New Guinea. Those interests, which are wide ranging, are accurately identified and documented in the Report. The geographical proximity of Papua New Guinea means that Australia has a special interest in Papua New Guinea's national unity, economic prosperity and social development. Australian private investment in Papua New Guinea currently stands at $A1.6 billion and industry estimates suggest that Australian companies may invest an additional $A3 billion in Papua New Guinea's resource sector over the next five years. Papua New Guinea is an important trading partner:  Australian exports to Papua New Guinea in 1991 were valued at $A861m. The importance of Papua New Guinea in Australian strategic planning is well known and we have a substantial Defence Cooperation Program with Papua New Guinea. The two countries' proximity has also meant that there is a need for close consultation on matters of mutual concern such as protection of the environment, quarantine and migration controls, and transnational criminal activity, including narcotics trafficking.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's commitment to its closest neighbour is reflected in the level of development assistance which is provided. In 1992/93, development assistance to Papua New Guinea is budgeted at $A306.7m, which is just over 25 per cent of Australia's total development assistance budget. Over $A4 billion of development assistance has been provided since 1975.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The well established business links and close personal ties between Australians and Papua New Guineans are two very important features of the relationship. At the present time some 12000 Australians live in Papua New Guinea. A much larger number of Australians has either worked in or visited Papua New Guinea at some stage of their lives and many long-standing relationships have been established.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The various interests Australia has in Papua New Guinea are of sufficient magnitude to demand the Government's close interest in and commitment to the bilateral relationship. The Committee expressly acknowledged that the Government<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"> </EMPHASIS>has given the relationship high priority. As a means of safeguarding our interests and maintaining that commitment, the Government has pursued as a policy goal the encouragement of greater people to people contact. Australian and PNG Ministers and senior government officials meet regularly in order to discuss various aspects of the relationship. The annual Ministerial Forum and frequent bilateral visits ensure that close contact is maintained between the two governments. Meetings at the ministerial level have never been as frequent, nor have they involved as many portfolios, as they do now. Contact between Parliamentarians is also increasing with benefits to both countries. Contact at officials' level is complemented by contact between business, academic, church and social groups under the umbrella of the bi-annual Australia-Papua New Guinea Colloquium.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The essential foundations of our relationship have remained unaltered since first enunciated by Prime Minister Whitlam at the time of Papua New Guinea's independence in 1975. Australia, he said "wants the closest possible relationship with her nearest neighbour, the new nation of Papua New Guinea; a relationship of equals, based on mutual respect, understanding and trust." That trust, that understanding and that respect, is necessary for us to develop a relationship which will go beyond normal diplomatic ties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government recognises, however, that its policy must keep pace with changes occurring in both countries. It accepts that the bilateral relationship will take on new dimensions as Australia and Papua New Guinea adjust to the rapidly changing global environment. The Government welcomes the steps taken by Papua New Guinea to expand and diversify its regional and international links and has actively encouraged the PNG Government to participate in regional and international forums and to establish a closer association with regional and international trade and economic organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government believes that Australia's policy must reflect the new realities in Papua New Guinea and must be sufficiently flexible to enable it to respond to the inevitable changes which will occur in Papua New Guinea as it continues towards greater self reliance. These changes will influence the trade and aid relationship throughout the 1990s. In order to meet them the Government has put in place mechanisms for the coordination and development of policy and activities in relation to Papua New Guinea, through the establishment of the PNG Policy Coordination Group, and the Government's policy is regularly reviewed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is confident that the close traditional ties between our countries will remain. The extent of our interests in Papua New Guinea, our proximity and our historical links will require Australia to be actively engaged in the constructive development of the relationship for the foreseeable future. The Government remains firmly committed to the maintenance and strengthening of Australia's relations with Papua New Guinea and, as will be evident from the following passages outlining government policy with regard to key elements in the relationship, is continuing to take positive action in support of that commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ECONOMIC RELATIONS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's economic links with Papua New Guinea are a vital component of the bilateral relationship. Australian trade and investment are important for Papua New Guinea's economic development and in return Australia receives substantial benefits from the activities of its private sector in Papua New Guinea. The Government agrees with the general thrust of the Report that the continuation and development of Australia's economic linkages with Papua New Guinea must be encouraged and supported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Papua New Guinea is an important export market for Australian goods and services. Australia has the largest share of Papua New Guinea's import market: approximately 40 per cent in 1990. Papua New Guinea is Australia's eighteenth largest export market overall and is our seventh largest market for elaborately transformed manufactured goods: indeed, exports of manufactured goods represent more than half of Australia's exports to Papua New Guinea. Australia is also an important export market for Papua New Guinea. In 1990 Australia was Papua New Guinea's second largest export market, taking 26.1 per cent of exports. Trade between the countries has, in the past few years, come roughly into balance: in 1988 it was 8 to 1 in Australia's favour, it is now 1.06 to 1. Australia continues to be Papua New Guinea's largest source of foreign investment: direct private investment was $A1.6 billion in 1990. Formally, the economic relationship is governed by the revised Agreement on Trade and Commercial Relations (PATCRA II), signed in 1991, and the Agreement for the Protection and Promotion of Investments (APPI), signed in 1990. Both agreements operate under the umbrella of the Joint Declaration of Principles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 1990s will be a period of rapid economic change in Papua New Guinea and the Government's policies are directed at ensuring that Australian exporters and investors are able to take full advantage of new opportunities in the commercial relationship. The anticipated growth in revenues from resource developments in Papua New Guinea should open up new opportunities in value added sectors as well as the established resources sector. Additional opportunities may also arise as the PNG Government's structural adjustment program takes effect. Australia is helping Papua New Guinea achieve its objective of balanced economic development through the provision of development assistance. Linkages between development cooperation and trade and investment are such that Australian investors and exporters will be able to benefit from the flow-through economic effects of this assistance. Australian investors and exporters will need to display renewed commitment to seek out these opportunities. The Australian Government also has a role to play. For example, at the 1992 Ministerial Forum, Ministers agreed to explore how cooperation and training in small and medium sized business might be strengthened.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The PNG Government has recently sought to develop closer relations with other nations in the Asia Pacific region. Australia has welcomed this development and has actively encouraged Papua New Guinea to become more involved in regional and international economic forums. In particular, we have suggested that Papua New Guinea participate in Pacific Economic Cooperation Conference (PECC) work projects and Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) working groups. Papua New Guinea's diversification of its external relations is likely to result in stronger economic linkages with other nations. We view the diversification of Papua New Guinea's commercial relationships as a positive development, while acknowledging that it may lead to a weakening of the Australian private sector's position in the PNG market. The Committee noted that the Australian private sector would need to respond to the possible loss of influence by making a renewed commitment to maintain and enhance its presence in Papua New Guinea's market. The Government agrees with this assessment, and has encouraged private sector efforts in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Communication at the business and government level is, and will continue to be, crucial in taking full advantage of commercial opportunities. The Australian Government liaises actively with the Australian private sector to exchange views on market conditions in Papua New Guinea. The Australia-Papua New Guinea Business Council and its counterpart, the Papua New Guinea-Australia Business Council, play a crucial communication role at the business-to-business level and the recently established Papua New Guinea-Queensland Business Cooperation group will be another useful mechanism for the development of business links.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Economic relations between Australia and Papua New Guinea have changed dramatically in recent years and this trend is likely to continue. Papua New Guinea exports to Australia rose by almost 150 per cent in 1990-91 bringing bilateral trade into balance. The increase is primarily due to increased exports of partially processed gold from mines which are largely financed by Australians. The shift in the balance of trade is one of several important factors which have prompted the Government to take a close look at the future of the economic relationship. In recent years, Australia's economic relations with Papua New Guinea have matured and although PATCRA has been an effective agreement, the Government agrees with the Committee's view that we should look with Papua New Guinea at establishing a more reciprocal trade agreement which is more in keeping with the status of Papua New Guinea and Australia as two equal and independent partners. Consideration is currently being given to possible options for a new commercial arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reflecting the important role that development cooperation has played and will continue to play in the bilateral relationship, 23 of the Committee's 56 recommendations are aid-related. The Government readily endorses the majority of these recommendations. The Committee's report and recommendations have provided an important and timely input to the aid policy formulation and program development process. In many instances the report reinforces policy and program directions which are already in train: for example, the recommendations concerning the development of administrative expertise in the PNG Public Service; population growth and family planning; the importance of the education sector; environment and the Tropical Forestry Action Plan;  law and order; the choice of sectors for program assistance; and humanitarian aid to Bougainville.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In some areas it has been possible to move in the directions advocated even earlier than the Committee has suggested. The Australian and PNG Governments are making arrangements to accelerate the shift from budget support to jointly programmed aid during the current Development Cooperation Treaty period. This is the culmination of a lengthy process of consultation with the PNG Government which commenced during Prime Minister Hawke's visit to Papua New Guinea in September 1990. As a result, jointly programmed aid will increase from $A31.7m in 1990/91 to $A37.3m  in 1991/92 and $A46m in 1992/93, and be maintained at least at that level in 1993/94. Moreover, the PNG Government has proposed that the level of jointly programmed aid in 1993/94 be further reviewed so as to facilitate a continued steady build-up in the project aid program. These increased levels of jointly programmed aid will be financed largely through transfer of funds from budget support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian development cooperation program with Papua New Guinea has played an important role in underpinning the close bilateral relationship. It will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. To that end, the Government endorses the thrust of the Committee's recommendations regarding future aid to Papua New Guinea. The Government shares the Committee's view that it is timely now to hasten the transformation of Australia's aid to Papua New Guinea through the further development of a program of project and program-type assistance. The development of such a program of assistance presents formidable challenges in a country such as Papua New Guinea where implementation and institutional capacities are understandably still developing. Nevertheless the Government remains strongly committed to the bilateral relationship and is determined to work closely with the PNG Government to put a large and developmentally effective program in place. The precise level and form of that program will be addressed in close consultation with the PNG Government in the context of the review of the Development Cooperation Treaty which is scheduled for September 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SECURITY ISSUES</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government broadly endorses the Committee's analysis of Papua New Guinea's security situation and, in general terms, agrees with the intent of the recommendations made concerning future Australian security assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The PNG Government has recognised that the country's law and order problems and internal security need to be given the highest priority. In 1990, the PNG Government reviewed its security needs and the role of its security forces in meeting those needs. In its review, the PNG Government found that security and development were inextricably intertwined: there must be security if development is to proceed and there must be development if security is to be maintained. The PNG Government also found that there was a need for a comprehensive, integrated and planned approach to its security requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government supports the decision made by the PNG Government to give priority to internal security and remains committed to helping Papua New Guinea deal with its internal security problems. When Papua New Guinea undertook its security review in 1990,  Australia agreed to review its security assistance to Papua New Guinea in order to ensure that it was directed towards helping Papua New Guinea meet its real security needs. Australian assistance to the PNGDF has traditionally been provided through defence cooperation programs, while Papua New Guinea's non-military security agencies, the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary (RPNGC) and Corrective Institutional Services (CIS), have received assistance under development cooperation programs administered by AIDAB.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In September 1991, the two Governments signed an Agreed Statement on Security Cooperation which sets out in broad terms the areas, principles and procedures for security cooperation between Australia and Papua New Guinea. The Government agrees with the finding of the PNG Government that greater integration and coordination among its security forces will improve the PNG Government's ability to deal effectively with internal security problems. The Government has expressed its clear support for two initiatives recently proposed by the PNG Government: the establishment of an Office of Security Coordination and of a Joint Services Training College.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's aim is to help Papua New Guinea develop its own institutional capacities. The placement of Australians in line positions, or in positions with operational responsibilities, is generally not consistent with Australia's aim and accordingly the Government will be looking to provide assistance through the use of advisers and technical experts who will be able to help their Papua New Guinean counterparts acquire new skills and expertise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DEFENCE RELATIONS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's defence relationship with Papua New Guinea is directed at assisting the PNGDF to perform its constitutional function under the direction of the PNG Government. The Defence Cooperation Program for 1992/93 is expected to be $A33m and will be focused primarily on the provision of training:  over two thirds will be spent on training programs and related ADF manpower assistance. At the PNG Government's request, we are currently providing sub-unit training in Australia for several PNGDF infantry companies. The training will concentrate in particular on improving military skills, discipline and leadership. The syllabus is based on Australian Army doctrine which encompasses the Geneva Convention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of the security review process carried out by the PNG Government, the PNGDF has accepted that it must focus more on internal security. Our Defence Cooperation Program will also be directed towards assisting the PNGDF fulfil its role in the management of the country's internal security problems, in particular through the development of joint police/defence force approaches to common security related requirements such as training and logistic support. Consistent with that approach, we have supported Papua New Guinea's requests, made at ministerial level, for assistance to conduct feasibility studies into joint training in Papua New Guinea for defence force, police and CIS officers and the establishment of a new base for the security forces&mdash;including police, infantry and engineer elements&mdash;in Papua New Guinea's Highlands region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The assistance provided to the RPNGC under the Defence Cooperation Program is of a technical rather than operational nature. The Government will continue to provide an Army communications adviser to the RPNGC and an Army training adviser to the AIDAB-funded Police Project. Communications assistance to the police has recently been increased by providing updated communications equipment and two radio technicians to supervise installation and maintenance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">BOUGAINVILLE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Throughout the Bougainville crisis the Australian Government has taken the position that Papua New Guinea's territorial integrity must be maintained and that the constitutional authority on Bougainville is the PNG national government. The Government did not acknowledge Bougainville's claim in May 1990 to independence. This reflected the similar position taken during the first Bougainville crisis in 1975 that Papua New Guinea should come to independence as one country in accordance with the wishes of the overwhelming majority of the Papua New Guinean people, as expressed by their elected representatives. At that time the Government said that Australia would give no sympathy, aid or support in any form to any group in Papua New Guinea working to undermine the country's unity. This policy has been maintained throughout the current crisis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has not sought to involve itself directly in talks involving the PNG Government and Bougainvilleans, but the Government has repeatedly encouraged the promotion of a settlement through dialogue and negotiation. Australia recognises that, in the first place, the Bougainville problem is one for Papua New Guinea. The solution to the Bougainville problem must be a Papua New Guinean one and cannot be constructed by non-Papua New Guineans.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We also agree with the PNG Government that a lasting solution cannot be imposed by force and have made known our strong conviction that the settlement should be reached through a political process. We have made it clear that we are willing to help, if all those involved want us to. Australia indicated a willingness to participate in the multilateral supervisory team proposed in the 1991 Honiara Declaration, but later it became clear that our participation was not acceptable to the Bougainville Revolutionary Army (BRA). We are prepared to help in any practical way that might contribute towards a solution. We are providing humanitarian assistance, including medical aid, and we have undertaken to help Papua New Guinea and Bougainvilleans rebuild Bougainville once a settlement has been reached.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are concerned to do what we can to help improve living conditions on Bougainville. Medical aid has been our main priority because health services on Bougainville, once the most effective in Papua New Guinea, have been seriously disrupted. Over and above our budget support assistance, which helps fund the PNG Government's own efforts to improve conditions, Australia has so far provided $A177,300 to help fund an International Red Cross program and $A258,000 to provide all the finance for the medical relief program coordinated by the Australian Council for Overseas Aid. Both projects aim to provide assistance in all parts of the province and were developed with the support of the PNG Government. We have done what we can to make sure the aid gets through to those in need by keeping in close touch with those involved, and by assisting in transporting supplies where necessary. We hope that all Bougainvillean groups, including the BRA, will cooperate in creating circumstances which allow the PNG Government and others to improve medical conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A willingness to help on Bougainville also reflects Australia's interest in the province's future. An Australian-funded survey of Bougainville's rehabilitation needs began late last year and Bougainvilleans can be assured that once a settlement is reached, Australia will do what it can to assist with the tasks of rehabilitation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was our humanitarian concern that also led to our taking up with the PNG Government allegations that abuses were committed by members of its security forces in 1989 and 1990. The fact that abuses were alleged to have been committed by both sides in difficult conditions did not lessen our concern. The Government has raised these allegations with Prime Minister Namaliu and PNG ministers, who are also concerned. Some cases involving alleged abuses on Buka, where conditions have now stabilised, have already been taken to court. We would like to see faster progress in addressing the issue, but we have to bear in mind that there are obstacles in the way of speedy resolution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government recognises that divisions within the province itself make the Bougainville situation a complex one. The necessary political solution may not come quickly or easily but we will continue to help where we can.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">LAW AND ORDER</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ability of the PNG Government to deal effectively with continuing law and order problems will have a significant impact on Papua New Guinea's national development. In its review of social developments in Papua New Guinea, the Committee identified the increasing level of crime and violence in Papua New Guinea as a serious problem affecting the economic and social development of the population. The Committee expressly referred to the negative effect that the law and order problem is likely to have on investment in Papua New Guinea.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The PNG Government held a national crime summit in February 1991 and, shortly thereafter, implemented a number of measures designed to address the major law and order problems. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The PNG Government realises, however, that these problems cannot be solved by short term measures and that a national strategy to restore sustainable law and order in Papua New Guinea will need to be drawn up and implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is firmly committed to helping Papua New Guinea deal with its law and order problems. At the request of the PNG Government, Australia is providing assistance which is specifically directed towards improving the PNG Government's capacity in this area. Approximately 33 per cent of Australia's 1991/92 project aid allocation to Papua New Guinea has been budgeted for use in law and order programs. Australia's assistance is being provided through three AIDAB funded projects: the RPNGC project; the Police Housing project; and the Corrective Institutional Services project. The RPNGC also receives communications maintenance assistance and training from ADF personnel under the Defence Cooperation Program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The aim of the RPNGC project is to assist with the development of an effective and efficient community-based police constabulary. The five year project was commenced in 1988 and its estimated total cost is $A29m. There are currently 43 advisers employed under the project, the key objective of which in 1992 is the development of RPNGC operational and training capabilities. The project is due for review this year and is likely to be extended for a further three years. The Police Housing Project was designed in response to a request from Papua New Guinea to design, supply and erect 150 houses for the RPNGC in 28 locations throughout Papua New Guinea. The contract for this $A10.7m project was signed in February 1992. The Corrective Institutional Services project will provide support for a CIS program designed to restore operational integrity and effectiveness to the prisons. The total cost of the first phase of the project is $A3.3m.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">BORDER ISSUES</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government considers management of Australia's bilateral relations in the common border area to be an important aspect of our relations with Papua New Guinea. A framework for constructive management of the area is provided by the Torres Strait Treaty which defines maritime boundaries between Australia and Papua New Guinea and protects the rights of traditional inhabitants of the area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of consultative mechanisms have been established under the treaty. The Joint Advisory Council (JAC), which is made up of representatives of traditional inhabitants from both countries and officials of national and state/provincial governments, is the major consultative forum. Other regular consultative processes include Treaty Liaison Meetings and Traditional Inhabitant Meetings. Torres Strait Islanders are able to take an active role in the management of the treaty through participation in these processes. The Government agrees with the committee's view that regular consultation is essential to the ongoing implementation of the treaty and a meeting of the Joint Advis ory Council is scheduled to take place later this year. When appropriate, issues of concern about developments in the Torres Strait and the effective management of the Treaty have also been raised by the Government with the PNG Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is firmly committed to the effective management of the Torres Strait. Issues of mutual concern covering the environment, health, free movement and trafficking in drugs and arms are being actively pursued through the various consultative processes and bilaterally where appropriate. Officials from several government departments are permanently based in the Torres Strait and regular consultations are held with the local Islander Coordinating Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">FUTURE DIRECTIONS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Papua New Guinea is a relatively young nation which is going through a period of adjustment and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">growth. The Government has acknowledged the challenges facing Papua New Guinea and has expressed its confidence in the efforts currently being made by the PNG Government. Australia's role is that of a friendly and reliable neighbour prepared to provide assistance to support the efforts of the PNG Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's informative analysis of the political, social, economic and strategic developments affecting Papua New Guinea and the implications of these developments for Australia has been a most useful contribution to the development of government policy with regard to Australia's relations with Papua New Guinea. The Government has given serious consideration to the Committee's recommendations. The report has been, and will continue to be, an important reference for the Government in the development of its policy and for the community at large in increasing its knowledge of Papua New Guinea.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 1</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends the establishment of a mechanism for ensuring regular exchanges between Papua New Guinea and Australian politicians. This report wishes to restate the recommendations made in the Report on the Visit to Papua New Guinea: February 1991 namely, that regular and reciprocal parliamentary exchanges be instituted. They should be formalised by agreement of the Presiding Officers of the Parliaments. An Australian delegation should visit Papua New Guinea every second year, with a Papua New Guinea delegation making a visit during the alternating years. A program of discussions and observation should be arranged at both national and state/provincial level.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 2</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee considers that liaison between committees of similar purpose and function should also be developed and that ministers of the Papua New Guinea Government should be encouraged to attend the Ministerial Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 26</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that all government departments be urged to publicise more widely their programs and links with Papua New Guinea.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government strongly endorses the Committee's recommendations concerning the strengthening of parliamentary links and supports the Committee's call for regular meetings between members of Parliament from both countries. In October 1990, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade wrote to other ministers expressly encouraging them to take advantage of opportunities to meet their PNG counterparts and establish a dialogue. Arrangements currently exist to facilitate regular liaison between Australian and PNG parliamentary committees.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 38</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that budget support should be replaced by program aid, supported where necessary by project aid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 39</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The choice of program areas (designated programs) should be based on sound long-term economic and social policies and be determined after close consultation between Australia and Papua New Guinea.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 40</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the overall size of the aid budget should be maintained at current nominal levels for the foreseeable future, with the level being reassessed only if increases in Papua New Guinea's resource-based income are significantly higher than anticipated. In the event that the total Australian aid budget is reduced, aid to Papua New Guinea should be cut by no more than a pro rata reduction. Any arbitrary reduction in aid should only be made after reasonable notice is given.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 41</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the move from budget support to program and project aid should be undertaken as a matter of urgency, commencing in 1993 or as soon as possible thereafter. During the transition there should be a mix of budget support and program and project aid, with the former being phased out by the end of 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given that negotiating projects and programs involves great administrative complexity and absorbs large amounts of scarce, high-level managerial capacity, the Committee recognises that there may be delays in the implementation of this recommendation. If that occurs, the total level of aid should be maintained through continuing budget support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government endorses the thrust of the Committee's recommendations regarding the future level and form of aid to Papua New Guinea. The Government shares the Committee's view that there needs to be a transformation of Australia's aid to Papua New Guinea through the further development of a program of project and program type assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is pleased to advise that, after lengthy consultations with the PNG Government, arrangements are being made to accelerate the shift from budget support to project/program assistance even earlier than the Committee has recommended. Within the current Development Cooperation Treaty period, $A16m and $A11m is to be transferred from the 1992/93 and 1993/94 budget support allocations to jointly programmed aid, resulting in an increase in jointly programmed aid to $A46m in both years. Moreover, the PNG Government has proposed that the level of jointly programmed aid in 1993/94 be examined further with a view to achieving a further increase for that year, thus facilitating a steady build up in the level of jointly programmed aid. The precise level and form of aid for the period 1994-1995 to 1996-97 will be determined after consultation with the PNG Government, in the context of the September 1992 review of the Treaty on Development Cooperation. The Government shares the Committee's views about the need for flexibility in this consultative process.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 3</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee supports the continuation and further development of aid projects aimed at actively assisting in the development of administrative expertise in the Papua New Guinea Public Service. Again, this could be achieved by secondment and/or exchange of personnel in areas of need identified by the Papua New Guinea Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 9</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that support be given to the Development of Women's Opportunities Project in order that women might have access to funds to develop commercial enterprises based on subsistence farming skills, and to promote women's financial independence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government welcomes the Committee's support for assistance specifically directed at the development of administrative expertise in the PNG Public Service. Public sector development and capacity building has been a major objective of Australia's aid program to date. Although secondment and exchanges of personnel do assist with this process, AIDAB's experience has shown that the provision of advisers and technical experts is generally a more effective method of providing support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AIDAB has provided assistance for a number of institution strengthening projects. PNG departments and agencies which are being assisted in this way include Police, Taxation, Civil Aviation, Customs and the National Broadcasting Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Women in Development Fund (WIDF) was established by AIDAB in 1984 to assist with the effective implementation of Australian government aid policy to women in developing countries. The WIDF has been used in Papua New Guinea to support a number of projects. In 1991/92, WIDF funding in Papua New Guinea is $A54,000 (8 per cent of the global total). Australian government support for projects concerned with the development of women will continue. However it is up to the PNG Government to identify the Development of Women's Opportunities Project as one which should receive priority over other development needs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AIDAB is currently investigating ways in which support can be provided for commercial development. The Committee's recommendations on improving opportunities for women are strongly supported and will be taken to account in the development of any program or project in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">- EDUCATION AND TRAINING&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 5</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that one of the priorities in the new program aid system should be the development of special programs aimed specifically at unemployed youth e.g. technical and vocational training, agricultural and business extension and small scale local public works. These should be developed in consultation with the Papua New Guinea Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 6</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that, as the aid program moves away from budget to project or program aid, the education sector is given a high priority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 7</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that aid be directed through professional associations and company training programs to the development of such skills as accounting and engineering.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 8</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia can further assist by offering taxation concessions to Australian companies for the cost of their training investment in Papua New Guinea.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 31</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that through AIDAB and the Australia-Papua New Guinea Business Council, the Australian Government promote the short-term exchange of middle managers between businesses in Papua New Guinea and Australia, so that middle-managers can gain training through practical experience.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 33</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Department of Employment, Education and Training establish a unit within its International Division with the specific objective of developing links between tertiary institutions in Australia and Papua New Guinea, particularly teacher training institutions. Through these links the department should seek to facilitate both programs of training and exchange among both staff and students, supporting and extending the work of the International Development Program (IDP).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government agrees with the Committee's conclusion that development of Papua New Guinea's education sector is of vital importance to Papua New Guinea's development. Support for education and training is an essential part of the Government's commitment to help Papua New Guinea overcome key constraints to development. The education sector has been, and will continue to be, a high priority in Australia's aid program to Papua New Guinea. Since 1975, over 3000 Papua New Guineans have taken up sponsored study and training awards in Australia. In 1992 more than 800 Papua New Guineans will receive academic and other training in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More than 30 per cent of AIDAB program/project aid funds are currently being directed towards the education and training sector through the PNG Secondary School Students Scheme, the Sponsored Training Program, the Community Teachers College Lecturers' Project and other smaller activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AIDAB intends to review its education and training program and the Committee's recommendation that aid be directed through professional associations and company training programs will be taken into account in the review. While the Government recognises that appropriately directed tax concessions can provide an important incentive for companies to provide training, it does not believe that it would be appropriate to introduce specific tax concessions directed at Australian companies with operations in Papua New Guinea. Under Australian domestic tax law, Australian companies are already able to claim expenses associated with training as an allowable deduction. The introduction of special concessions for Australian companies who invest in training in Papua New Guinea would detract from the Government's objectives of achieving simplicity and neutrality in the tax system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government agrees with the Committee's view that efforts should be made to develop and encourage greater links between the Australian and Papua New Guinean business communities and supports the Committee recommendation concerning the short term exchange of PNG middle managers and their Australian counterparts. Exchanges are currently arranged by a number of Australian firms with offices in Papua New Guinea. Austrade, in close liaison with the Australia-Papua New Guinea Business Council (APNGBC), will look at ways of increasing opportunities for exchanges and training. The AIDAB Sponsored Training Program could also be used for this purpose but Papua New Guinea rarely allocates training funds to the private sector. Previous proposals by AIDAB and the APNGBC to establish a specific scheme of this nature were rejected by the PNG authorities in favour of the provision of a small number of existing places under the sponsored training program. Nevertheless, further opportunities may arise in the context of the forthcoming review of PATCRA, and AIDAB will pursue these opportunities in order to enhance business cooperation and training in the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee expressly refers to the importance of encouraging economic analysis of Papua New Guinea in Australia. The Government acknowledges the usefulness of accurate and independent analysis of this nature and believes steps should be taken to support and strengthen Australian academic interest and expertise in this area. The Government agrees with the Committee that improving links between educational institutions in Papua New Guinea and Australia would be useful in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the establishment of a separate unit in the Department of Employment, Education and Training could be useful in the development of Australian academic interest in Papua New Guinea, the Government considers that a PNG studies centre set up at an Australian university would be a more effective method of establishing ties and encouraging Australian research on Papua New Guinea. The Government will discuss with the International Development Program of Australian Universities and Colleges (IDP) the possibility of holding a special forum, under the auspices of the Papua New Guinea-Australia Colloquium, to consider ways of developing and encouraging Australian academic interest in Papua New Guinea. Consideration of the usefulness and possible location of a PNG studies centre would be within the Colloquium's terms of reference.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Colloquium is an informal institution which was established following the signing of the Joint Declaration of Principles guiding relations between Papua New Guinea and Australia in order to strengthen understanding and cooperation between the two countries. The major objective of the Colloquium is to identify issues and problems of interest to both countries that would benefit from cooperative effort in research, development planning, joint ventures and other forms of collaboration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">- HEALTH&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 4</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that Australia offer a specific project to the family planning associations of Papua New Guinea in order that they might develop and promote comprehensive services on birth control. This aid could be delivered either through an expansion of current Non-government Organisation (NGO) services or through an AIDAB health project. We should also encourage the United Nations Family Planning Association to be involved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 10</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that, after consultation with the National Council of Women in Papua New Guinea, a major increase in funds be made available through the Women in Development Fund and other appropriate agencies in support of family planning and for programs aimed at reducing domestic violence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 11</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee believes there is scope for a close association to be developed between women's groups and family planning organisations in Papua New Guinea and Australia with a view to sharing ideas and personnel. (See also Recommendation 4.)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 12</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that priority be given to directing Australian program and project aid towards health projects which improve disease eradication in Papua New Guinea and expand medical research and training through a commitment by the Commonwealth Government to funding for the Tropical Health Program (THP) at the University of Queensland and the Queensland Institute of Medical Research. (See also Recommendation 50.)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government fully accepts the Committee's concerns about the high rate of population growth in Papua New Guinea and the need for improved access to family planning services. AIDAB has already undertaken a baseline study on the impact of rapid population growth in Papua New Guinea. AIDAB is currently undertaking a series of project planning missions with the World Bank to investigate precisely how donors can best assist in the area of population planning. The Committee's recommendation on mechanisms for assistance in this area, including support for PNG women's organisations, will be taken into account in this context.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AIDAB will soon be designing the next phase of the Police Development Project and the Committee's recommendation on domestic violence will also be taken into account in this exercise as well as in the development of program assistance to the law and order sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government endorses the thrust of recommendation 12. The geographical proximity of Papua New Guinea means that it is in Australia's interest to help control communicable diseases such as malaria. Poor health conditions in the Western Province of Papua New Guinea have lead to problems with the implementation of border controls in the Torres Strait. The health facilities in Australia are more developed than those available in Papua New Guinea and PNG residents frequently cross the Torres Strait border seeking medical care. The Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services has approved a proposal for the establishment of a Papua New Guinea-Australia Health Liaison Committee and recommendation 12 will be referred to this committee once it is established. In addition, Commonwealth funding for the Tropical Health Program is currently under review by the advisory committee to the National Review of Commonwealth Funded Public Health, Education and Research Programs and the recommendation will be taken into account in their deliberations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Support for health research in Australia for the benefit of Papua New Guinea is important but the PNG Government may place higher priority on institutional strengthening of health administration within Papua New Guinea. AIDAB is working on this problem with other donors and has a number of activities in train or planned in this sector. These include medical officer training, hospital management and possibly support for para medical training.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ENVIRONMENT</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 15</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 16</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that AIDAB monitor the impact of the Tropical Forest Action Plan and that AIDAB report to the Parliament on its success.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 17</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that Australia support a survey of species of Papua-New Guinea flora and fauna and, through connections with wildlife and conservation groups in Australia, offer expertise in the development and management of nature reserves.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government endorses the recommendation that assistance be offered to the Government of Papua New Guinea to develop expertise in monitoring and enforcement of environmental standards. The recommendation is in line with the emphasis towards strengthening Papua New Guinea's institutions which is a feature of Australia's current aid program. AIDAB expects to receive a request from the PNG Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC) for assistance in strengthening the department's operational capacity. Careful coordination will be required as a number of donors are interested in assisting in this area. Some technical assistance is already being provided to the DEC in conjunction with the World Bank under the aegis of Papua New Guinea's National Forestry Conservation Action Program (formally the Tropical Forest Action Plan). The program is designed to improve the department's capacity to control and manage Papua New Guinea's forest resources. In 1990/91 the Government contributed $A1.6m to the program and a further $A1.6m has been provided in 1991/2. AIDAB has extensive current and planned involvement in the implementation of this program and will continue to monitor its impact and report on its success.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has also helped the PNG National Weather Service develop its administrative and scientific expertise. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology has a long history of close cooperation with the National Weather Service, which includes the provision of technical assistance and AIDAB funded training in Australia for PNG officers (51 since 1975) resulting in qualification as observers, technical officers or meteorologists.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The importance of an accurate geographical record of flora and fauna species as an essential part of a comprehensive conservation strategy is acknowledged by the Government. Surveys of native flora and fauna in Papua New Guinea are conducted by the PNG Department of Environment and Conservation on an ongoing basis. A significant body of information on this subject was collected by CSIRO during the 1960s and 1970s and is readily available. In addition, as part of existing arrangements relating to quarantine issues, annual joint surveys of areas of Papua New Guinea are conducted by both governments to determine the presence of pests and disease, and botanical collections are made as part of these surveys.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government agrees with the intent of the Committee's recommendation and will look into the possibility of assisting Papua New Guinea further develop its survey coverage. AIDAB has indicated to the PNG Government that this is the type of activity it would be interested in supporting as part of its general assistance to the PNG Government in the management of protected areas.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that individuals and/or cultural organisations be encouraged to tour Papua New Guinea as part of an overall cultural exchange.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government accepts the Committee's views on the importance of encouraging people to people contacts and agrees that further steps can be taken to encourage the development of closer cultural relations between Australia and Papua New Guinea. Promotion of knowledge and understanding of each other's  country is one of the basic principles set out in the Joint Declaration of Principles guiding relations between Australia and Papua New Guinea.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following the signing of the Joint Declaration in 1987, the Government asked the International Development Program of Australian Universities and Colleges (IDP) to assume the responsibility for planning and organising a Colloquium to explore ways of strengthen understanding and cooperation between Australia and Papua New Guinea. Two Colloquiums have been held so far; the first in Townsville in August 1988 covered trade and commerce, mining, environment, health and rural development, and the second, which dealt with trade and investment promotion and resource development, was held in Lae in September 1991. Funding for the Colloquiums and ongoing Colloquium activities has been provided by the Australian and PNG Governments and there are national committees for the Colloquium in each country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government considers that the Colloquiums have been useful in developing an awareness of the diverse aspects of the bilateral relationship and believes that the Australia-Papua New Guinea colloquium could also serve as a further instrument for the development of cultural relations between the two countries. The Colloquium can examine the range and nature of existing cultural links and recommend ways in which cultural linkages can be enhanced. The Government also welcomes the efforts by groups such as the Australia-Papua New Guinea Friendship Association, and the business councils, to promote people to people contact.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade maintains a small ($A75,000) cultural relations program with Papua New Guinea. This has enabled the department to mount a useful range of activities and exchanges in a number of areas, including visual and performing arts, craft, music, sport and literature. In recent years an Australian film festival and a display of Australian culture have taken place in Port Moresby and there have been regular visits by performing artists. The Government will continue with these programs and encourage visits and tours to Papua New Guinea by individuals and cultural organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia-Papua New Guinea Council</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the Government is sympathetic to the proposal, the establishment of an  Australia-Papua New Guinea Council is not supported because the nature of Australia's relationship with Papua New Guinea is significantly and qualitatively different from the relationships with most other countries with which we have established bilateral councils or foundations. Australia and Papua New Guinea have had a long and close association and strong commercial, social and cultural ties already exist.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The links established over the years with Papua New Guinea continue on the basis of shared interests and it is not considered that a council is necessary to sustain and develop these links.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government notes the Committee's recommendation concerning the provision of aid for the development of cultural exchanges and links and will take this recommendation into account in future planning of the aid program. However, programs of this nature normally fall outside the scope of a development cooperation program and may not be among development priorities identified by the PNG Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Media Links</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that efforts be made to improve media linkages between Australia and Papua New Guinea as a way of fostering greater understanding between the people of Australia and Papua New Guinea. Under the Government's Overseas Media Visitors program journalists from PNG are sponsored to visit Australia on familiarisation visits and to report on Australia's policies and attitudes. Journalists from Australia can apply to travel to PNG under the South East Asia and Pacific Media Awards Program which is  jointly funded by the Government and the Australian Journalists Association.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC) has a long history of involvement in the promotion of broadcasting in Papua New Guinea, including exchanges of journalists. Under the Development Cooperation Program, the ABC is currently helping the PNG Government develop the capacities of the PNG National Broadcasting Commission. This will further improve media linkages. The Government notes the Committee's recommendation concerning the potential for News Corporation and Channel 9 to contribute more fully towards the bilateral relationship. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has regular meetings with editors and senior journalists from both organisations and the Committee's recommendation will be raised in the context of these meetings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The granting of visas to journalists is a matter for Papua New Guinea to determine and while the Government is sympathetic to the idea of multiple entry visas for journalists with an established interest in Papua New Guinea, the type of visa which should be issued to journalists is a question for the PNG Government to decide upon.</PARA>

(See also Recommendations 34, 35 and 36.)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government shares the Committee's views on the importance of Australia's economic relationship with Papua New Guinea and is in general agreement with the recommendations which the Committee has made. The Government recognises the unique opportunities which the PNG economy can offer Australian businesses and agrees that it is important for Australian businesses to maintain and enhance their presence in Papua New Guinea.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The commercial relationship is in a dynamic and maturing phase. After being heavily in Australia's favour for many years, bilateral trade is currently in balance, due primarily to significant exports of gold from PNG. A number of trends will lead to new opportunities in trade and investment in both directions. These include: the expected rapid increase in activity in the PNG resources sector, including possible oil exports to Australia; the shift from budget support to program/project assistance; structural adjustment in the PNG economy and efforts by the PNG Government to promote manufacturing and down-stream processing; and the phased tariff reduction program in Australia. In order to seize upon these opportunities we will need to ensure that the bilateral commercial framework and mechanisms for consultation between and amongst business and government continue to work effectively.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current commercial framework, PATCRA, was signed in 1977 in the immediate post-colonial phase of the relationship. It provides non-reciprocal duty free access for almost all PNG exports to Australia. In view of the rapid changes taking place in the commercial relationship, the Government is currently studying whether there is an alternative to PATCRA&mdash;a more open and reciprocal arrangement&mdash;which would be more effective and better serve the interests of both countries. Australia raised this issue at the 1992 Ministerial Forum and both governments agreed to examine options over 1992 with a view to discussing them in detail at the next Forum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regular consultation and information dissemination are also important factors which will help Australia make the most of commercial opportunities. The Government encourages consultation at all levels and agrees with the Committee on the importance of developing and maintaining strong links between counterpart professional organisations and institutes. Government ministers have attended meetings of the two Business Councils, and also met informally with the executive of Australia-Papua New Guinea Business Council (APNGBC). Government officials also participate regularly in APNGBC meetings. A wide range of formal and informal links already exists. The APNGBC is currently assisting the Government to identify whether there are any significant gaps in these links, and will encourage the development of additional links where appropriate. The Government also supports the recent initiative of the Papua New Guinea and Queensland Governments to form a Papua New Guinea-Queensland Business Cooperation Group which has the objective of creating a greater awareness of business opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Queensland plays an important role in bilateral trade between the two countries. Approximately 40 per cent of Australia's exports to Papua New Guinea are sourced from Queensland. The Government believes that a PNG consulate in Cairns could facilitate trade and business travel between northern Australia and Papua New Guinea and would also help to strengthen the management of bilateral issues such as quarantine. A decision to establish a consulate in Cairns is, however, one for Papua New Guinea to take. If requested by the PNG Government, the Government would, in keeping with its own resource constraints, facilitate the opening of a consulate in Cairns.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Investment seminars will also assist with the development of bilateral trade and the Government is taking steps to promote Australian investment in Papua New Guinea. In conjunction with the Papua New Guinea-Australia Business Council, the PNG Department of Trade and Industry and the PNG Investment Promotion Authority, Austrade is actively examining the possibility of a joint trade and investment promotion mission to Australia during the 1992/93 financial year. The sectors to be targeted by such promotions would of course be nominated by the PNG Government and its instrumentalities but would almost certainly include the manufacturing, processing and agricultural sectors. An Australian consultant has been engaged by the PNG Department of Trade and Industry, using Australian Government funding, to develop a Trade and Investment strategy for Papua New Guinea. This strategy will form the basis for continued market and investment promotion assistance from the Australian Government through the Market Advisory Service.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 54</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that Australia promote Papua New Guinea's full entry into the APEC group of nations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Decisions of the Cairns Group, including decisions on possible expansion of membership, are made by consensus. It would not therefore be possible for Australia to seek unilaterally to enlist Papua New Guinea as a member of the Group. Over the past few years, several countries have expressed interest in joining the Cairns Group. The Group has however preferred to concentrate on maintaining its cohesive activity within the GATT Uruguay Round agriculture negotiations and remains at its original fourteen members. Papua New Guinea has not participated in the Uruguay Round and, with the Round now in its crucial final stage, Group cohesion and solidarity is of vital importance. It would not therefore be opportune to seek to expand membership of the Group at this time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia would, however, welcome the general support of Papua New Guinea for the trade liberalising objectives of the Cairns Group and the Government has actively encouraged Papua New Guinea to develop a closer relationship with the GATT.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government also supports and welcomes Papua New Guinea's involvement in regional economic cooperation. Most recently, at the 1992 Ministerial Forum, Australian ministers expressly encouraged Papua New Guinea to develop its economic links within the region, particularly through participation in the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC) and Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) working groups (as a member of the South Pacific Forum observer delegation). The Government keeps the PNG Government briefed on developments within APEC and provides regular information on upcoming PECC and APEC meetings and work projects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the Government acknowledges Papua New Guinea's interest in becoming a separate participant in APEC, the initiative rests with Papua New Guinea. APEC participants have taken the general view that, in principle, the group should be open to expanded participation by economies within the Asia Pacific region with the main criterion for participation being the strength of economic linkages with the region. Any additional participation would need the consensus of the existing participants. Following the admission to APEC of the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong and Chinese Taipei at the APEC III meeting in Seoul last year, the sense of the membership is that APEC needs time to consolidate while questions of APEC's institutional development are considered. Ministers at APEC III requested officials to discuss the question of participation and report back to the next Ministerial meeting to be held in September this year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SECURITY ISSUES</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">- DEFENCE RELATIONSHIP&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 42</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Australian Defence Force (ADF) engineers' program in the Southern Highlands Province be used as a model for an extension of such programs into other provinces of Papua New Guinea; and that this be pursued in partnership with the PNGDF engineering battalion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 43</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As Australia has a Defence Co-operation Program with Papua New Guinea, the Committee supports the planned integration of the defence force and police force for the defined and limited purposes of joint training and logistical support. However, in the light of the dangers inherent in armies doing police work, the Committee is strongly of the view that the Papua New Guinea Government should develop strict guidelines for the deployment of the PNGDF for civilian tasks and that these guidelines should be reflected in the joint training program and in the use of equipment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 44</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where Australia is involved the Committee recommends that enhanced emphasis be applied to the training of the PNGDF for civilian tasks, encompassing humanitarian law and civic duties; and that Australia offer to continue a role in recruit and officer training.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 47</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that on providing gifts of military equipment to Papua New Guinea the Australian and Papua New Guinea Governments should develop clear and agreed guidelines about how the equipment will be used.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 48</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends, despite the inhibitions on Australia's actions caused by our past colonial and present commercial ties with Papua New Guinea, that the Australian Government should do more to encourage Papua New Guinea to investigate human rights abuses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 49</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, in consultation with the Papua New Guinea Government, the Australian Government should explore ways in which Australian aid to Papua New Guinea might be used to enhance safeguards for human rights protection.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 56</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that Australian Defence Force training of the PNGDF take note of the need to develop greater proficiency in border patrolling.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's defence relationship with Papua New Guinea is undergoing a period of adjustment following the recent review of Papua New Guinea's security needs. The Government notes the Committee's support for a continuation of defence ties with Papua New Guinea and generally agrees with the Committee's recommendations concerning Australia's future security assistance to Papua New Guinea Defence Force (PNGDF).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Agreed Statement on Security Cooperation, signed in September 1991, the Government indicated its commitment to provide assistance to the PNG Government in implementing the findings of its security review and its intention to engage in wide-ranging programs of co-operation to strengthen Papua New Guinea's self reliance. Australian assistance in this area is, however, dependent upon PNG security agencies further defining and agreeing upon Papua New Guinea's national priorities in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of the security reviews there has been a move towards greater cooperation between the Papua New Guinea Defence Force and the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary (RPNGC) in the areas of joint training and logistics support, a development which is expressly supported by the Committee. The Government has encouraged the PNGDF to become actively involved in the development of joint programs of this nature and, consistent with the priorities set out in the Agreed Statement on Security Cooperation, is assisting with the study of a number of possibilities for joint arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In August 1991, the Minister for Defence offered to fund feasibility studies for two proposals to develop a program for joint training in Papua New Guinea for security agency officers and to establish a highlands base. Terms of reference for these studies and formal requests for defence cooperation assistance have been received from Papua New Guinea. Proposals for common logistic support arrangements between the PNGDF and RPNGC, raised at the Defence Cooperation talks last October, have been discussed with PNG officials.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Initial work on the feasibility studies has commenced. The investigation into joint officer training is based on a proposal to establish a joint services training college which would run combined courses for officers of the PNGDF, RPNGC and CIS, as a means of improving understanding among the disciplined services of their respective roles, responsibilities and methods. The proposed college would also be responsible for devising joint operational doctrine and procedures, and would provide training in leadership, management and administration. A joint Australian/PNG study team, including representatives from the Department of Defence, the AFP, AIDAB, PNGDF, RPNGC and CIS has reported to the PNG Government on possible options, including the feasibility of, and benefits from, joint officer training, a possible course syllabus and funding and command arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The study of the feasibility of a highlands base is presently at the conceptual level. The project team is looking at possible participants&mdash;PNGDF engineer and infantry elements, police and the national youth scheme&mdash;and possible roles (for example, civic action tasks and support for police mobile squads in the highlands) and suitable locations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the focus of Australian assistance under the Defence Cooperation Program has been adjusted to take into account the priorities identified in the security review, training and other existing defence cooperation programs will continue to be provided by the Australian Defence Force.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government welcomes the recognition given by the Committee to the work done by the Australian army unit, 12 Chief Engineer Works, in civic action tasks and infrastructure development at Mendi in the PNG Southern Highlands. With this positive example in mind, the Australian and PNG Governments have agreed to establish a similar joint ADF/PNGDF engineer unit, 11 Chief Engineer (CE) Works, at Vanimo in Sandaun Province. Two ADF personnel commenced their posting at Vanimo in January 1992. At present there are 4 ADF personnel at Vanimo and this will increase to 9 by January 1993. The PNGDF will provide 6 personnel to the unit by this date. The aim of the unit is to improve roads and other infrastructure in the region. This should not only help increase the government presence on the PNG/Irian Jaya border but should also encourage further economic development within the region. The Australian and PNG Governments intend that the activities of the newly formed combined engineer unit, 11 CE Works, will improve the infrastructure within, and physical access to, the northern border region and so assist the performance by the PNGDF and RPNGC of their border patrol duties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Provision of Training</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has expressed some concern about the inherent dangers of defence forces doing police work and refers to the need for appropriate guidelines and training. In providing defence cooperation assistance for proposals to develop joint arrangements among the PNG security forces, the Government is mindful of the respective roles of the defence force and police, as set out in the PNG Constitution, and the PNG Government's ability to call upon the PNGDF as a force of last resort to assist the police as an `aid to the civil power'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government shares the Committee's concern over the inherent difficulties which arise when a defence force is required to support police in internal security situations. The Government will continue to encourage the PNGDF to maintain appropriate standards of conduct in its contact with civilian communities. The provision of military training to the PNGDF is an important way in which Australia is able to support specifically the PNG Government's efforts in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the Defence Cooperation Talks in October 1991, the PNG Minister for Defence requested Australian training for the PNGDF. The ADF offered to provide subunit training in Australia for four PNGDF infantry companies in 1992. The training began in February 1992 and is expected to be completed in June 1992. The program, which was developed in conjunction with the PNGDF, concentrates on improving discipline, leadership and basic military skills and has several components designed to strengthen soldiers' awareness of humanitarian law and to provide guidance concerning proper treatment of civilians during security operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This operational training is based on current ADF doctrine, which in turn draws on the Geneva Convention, and includes training in rules of engagement and orders for opening fire as well as the humane treatment of prisoners and suspects. Training in fieldcraft will improve skills for administering a unit, deployed to rural areas, independently of local community resources. As with equivalent ADF training, the program covers humanitarian considerations in the conduct of operations which involve the civil community. These considerations include: clearly defining operational objectives; consulting with village leaders; providing for the comfort and hygiene of civilians during operations; and using military resources, for example a construction capability or medical supplies, to gain the confidence of village communities during operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The training program has components specifically designed to raise professional standards and improve discipline and leadership. The program includes instruction in basic military skills, involving activities such as passage of orders, weapon handling, navigation and fieldcraft, and the conduct of operations such as cordon and search, roadblocks and vital asset protection. Overall, the training program will enhance the PNGDF's capacity to carry out operational duties successfully, including those duties carried out in the border regions. In order to preserve the skills gained during the program of subunit training and to provide similar training for further PNGDF units, the Minister for Defence has written to the PNG Minister for Defence to suggest that the PNGDF develop arrangements for continuation of training in Papua New Guinea and offering Australian assistance to this end. An important objective of the Defence Cooperation Program is to help the PNGDF develop a self-sufficient training program focused on basic military skills.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Provision of Equipment</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In May 1991, the Minister for Defence stated that the current direction of change in our defence relationship with Papua New Guinea meant that it was inappropriate for Australia to seek to limit Papua New Guinea's ability to buy defence equipment from us in ways which differ from those applying to sales to other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister has directed the Department of Defence to review its Supply Support Arrangement (SSA) with Papua New Guinea to ensure that it is consistent with government policy on export of defence and related items. Sales of all defence materiel under the SSA will now be subject to the normal defence export approval guidelines. Similarly, any decision to provide major equipment items to Papua New Guinea will be made on a case by case basis against the guidelines on the export of defence and related goods.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Once the review is completed, these changes will be put to the PNG Government, at which time we will make clear our expectation that the use of any such acquisitions will remain consistent with the Australian Government's export policies and controls for defence and related items and, should Australian supplied equipment be used in ways inconsistent with the Australian Government's political or humanitarian concerns, then we would review the supply of such equipment. This approach would be consistent with the terms of the 1991 Agreed Statement on Security Cooperation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Human Rights</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Committee has noted, Australia enjoys a very close relationship with Papua New Guinea, but the Government has made it clear that this does not exempt Papua New Guinea from Australia's universal human rights policy, which is to deplore human rights abuses wherever they occur. The Government has therefore taken every opportunity to raise, at the highest level, allegations of human rights abuses in Papua New Guinea. In response, Prime Minister Namaliu has affirmed that the PNG Government does not condone human rights abuses and that Bougainville is no exception to that policy. The Government continues to encourage the PNG Government in its investigations of human rights abuses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should not be forgotten that allegations of abuses on Bougainville have also been made against the Bougainville Revolutionary Army (BRA). The Government understands that the BRA would not agree to a proposal, made by the PNG Government during the "Endeavour" talks, that the International Commission of Jurists be asked to assist with investigations into allegations of human rights abuses by both sides.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia and Papua New Guinea continue to explore ways in which Australian aid can be used to enhance the protection of human rights in Papua New Guinea. For example, components designed to strengthen soldiers' awareness of humanitarian law and to provide guidance concerning the proper treatment of civilians during military operations have been included in military training programs funded under the Defence Cooperation Program. The AIDAB Police Project will also contribute to the protection of human rights by helping to ensure that fundamental human rights issues are adequately addressed in the police force's training programs. Both governments intend to ensure that, wherever possible, Australian assistance supports the further development of human rights in Papua New Guinea. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">BOUGAINVILLE&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 45</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that Australia adopt a more active diplomatic role in trying to resolve the impasse between the Bougainvilleans and the Papua New Guinea Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 46</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee urges the Australian Government to press the Papua New Guinea Government to lift its restrictions on humanitarian aid to Bougainville and actively co-operate with Australian NGOs in the provision of this aid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's view is that only a political settlement reached by Papua New Guineans themselves will produce a lasting solution to the problems of Bougainville. A solution to the Bougainville problem, to be enduring and to be implemented, must be a Papua New Guinean one which takes full account of local views and knowledge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bougainville Revolutionary Army (BRA) has not viewed Australia as an acceptable negotiating partner because of our close links with the national government in Port Moresby, our declared position that the constitutional authority in the province is the national government and our wish to see the territorial integrity of Papua New Guinea maintained. The Government has nonetheless made clear on many occasions its support for the PNG Government's efforts to seek a peaceful solution and its readiness to provide any practical assistance which is acceptable to all parties to facilitate a political settlement. The Government has also indicated its willingness to make a venue available for talks should that be helpful and acceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government recognises the importance of NGO humanitarian assistance to Bougainville. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade took the initiative in November 1990 to raise with the PNG authorities the possibility of using NGOs to deliver medical supplies to Bougainville. Since then the Australian Government, through AIDAB, has made available $A258,000 to finance a program coordinated by Australian Council for Overseas Aid (ACFOA) to deliver medical supplies and medical assistance. The Government has also provided $A177,300 in support of a Red Cross appeal for funds for an immunisation program, transport and emergency medical supplies in the province. In addition, the Government has made clear to Papua New Guinea the importance it attaches to the speedy and successful implementation of NGO medical assistance programs in the province and has facilitated discussions between NGO and PNG representatives intended to improve their coordination.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present, and following assurances given by Prime Minister Namaliu in November 1991, NGO and PNG medical supplies are reaching most centres in the province, although distribution to central Bougainville has been hampered by the actions of BRA militants, such as the burning of the relief vessel "Cosmaris" on 28 January 1992. By seizing and burning the "Cosmaris" the BRA have made it harder to obtain vessels and crews to land medical relief in central Bougainville.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">- LAW AND ORDER&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 18</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is extremely concerned about the crime problem in Papua New Guinea and therefore recommends that there be an increased emphasis on the aid directed to the fight against crime, including:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the setting up of local police stations; support for a major upgrading of police training; the strengthening of the AIDAB police training project; the improvement of security in prisons; the provision of equipment and resources; and increasing co-operation between the Australian and Papua New Guinea police forces.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 30</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that Papua New Guinea anti-corruption and immigration authorities be granted access to relevant records held by their Australian counterparts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government shares the Committee's concerns about the law and order situation in Papua New Guinea. Australia has provided considerable assistance to the PNG Government in its efforts to deal with this problem and takes every opportunity to offer its support for Papua New Guinea's efforts in this area. At the February 1992 Ministerial Forum, the Government, reflecting the high priority given to the issue by Papua New Guinea, expressed its firm commitment to continue to help the PNG Government build up its capacity to deal effectively with crime.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian assistance to Papua New Guinea's law and order sector is currently provided under both the Development Cooperation Program and the Defence Cooperation Program. A large proportion of Australia's project aid budget is directed towards infrastructure development in Papua New Guinea's law and order sector. AIDAB is currently funding three major projects. The RPNGC Development Project is designed to increase police operational efficiency and improve law enforcement methods. The Police Housing Project will boost police morale and lead to a more visible RPNGC presence in strategic areas. The Correctional Institutional Services project is designed to restore operational integrity and effectiveness to the prison system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Support in the fight against crime is also being provided by the ADF under the Defence Cooperation Program. The RPNGC has received updated communications equipment and two radio technicians have been assigned to Papua New Guinea to supervise installation and maintenance of the equipment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Assistance to Papua New Guinea's law and order sector will continue to be a major priority in the future as Australia's aid program moves from budget support to program and project aid. Attention will remain focused on the development of the key institutions in the criminal justice system. Support provided under the Defence Cooperation Program will also significantly assist the PNG security force in their efforts to address the internal security problem.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Cooperation in Law Enforcement</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has developed good relations with Papua New Guinea's law enforcement authorities and suitable mechanisms for exchange of information already exist. The Australian Federal Police (AFP) has an arrangement with the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary for the sharing of criminal intelligence and other PNG law enforcement authorities are able to have access to such information through the established liaison procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Access to information concerning Australians who have been subject to disciplinary penalties under Australian company law is currently authorised under the Corporations Law and section 127 of the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989. A recent government initiative has the potential to further assist PNG authorities to access information concerning Australians of interest to Papua New Guinea's corporate law authorities. The Mutual Assistance in Business Regulation Bill 1992, which is currently before the Senate, will enable the Australian Securities Commission to compulsorily acquire information and pass it to foreign agencies in certain circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is actively seeking to increase the level of cooperation between Australian police forces and the RPNGC. A number of initiatives, which have the support of all other Australian police forces, have been introduced by the AFP to further develop existing links and strengthen arrangements for the exchange of information on criminal activity. Cooperation between the forces is also strengthened by the AFP's involvement in projects designed to enhance the skills and capabilities of the RPNGC.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 14</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that for those mining operations that have an impact on the Torres Strait, assiduous and independent monitoring and, if necessary, immediate preventative or restorative action by both the companies and governments need to be guaranteed, both before and during mining operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 50</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee endorses the call by the Island Coordinating Council that Australian program aid be directed to the improvement of the economic situation and social services, particularly health services, of the Western Province, at least to the level of the better served parts of the country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 51</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Australian Government begin urgent and regular discussions with the representatives of the Torres Strait Islanders to demonstrate sensitivity to their concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 52</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that steps be taken to discuss the problems of the Torres Strait with the Papua New Guinea Government and to put to the Papua New Guinea Government any modifications to the Treaty that are perceived to be necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Torres Strait Treaty is one of the key elements of Australia's relations with Papua New Guinea and its effective implementation is essential. The Government seeks to ensure that management of this border region meets the needs of the traditional inhabitants and the mutual interests of Australia and Papua New Guinea. At the present time, environmental management, health conditions and border controls are the Government's major priorities in the Torres Strait region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Torres Strait Treaty, the Government has a responsibility to consult with the traditional inhabitants on a regular basis. The Australian Treaty Liaison Officer, who is permanently based at Thursday Island, is in close contact with Torres Strait Islanders on a day to day basis concerning Treaty related matters. There are also a number of consultative forums where representatives of the Islanders are able to discuss issues concerning the management of the region with their Papua New Guinean counterparts and with officials from both sides on a regular basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The major forum is the treaty's Joint Advisory Council (JAC) which provides a mechanism for problems in the management and implementation of the treaty to be addressed by both Australia and Papua New Guinea. Under the terms of the treaty, three representatives from the Torres Strait Island communities participate in the nine member Australian delegation to the JAC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Representatives of the island communities are also involved with a number of committees and groups which report to the JAC, including the Traditional Inhabitants Meeting, the Environment Management Committee, the Protected Zone Joint Authority and the Torres Strait Fishing Industry and Islander Consultative Committee. The Traditional Inhabitants Meeting has proved to be particularly useful in resolving border related problems at the community level.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Torres Strait Islanders are able to discuss Australia's implementation of the treaty through representation at the Torres Strait Tripartite Forum which was established in 1991 as a means of improving liaison between the Torres Strait Islanders and Commonwealth and State agencies which have a presence in the area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is satisfied that this consultative framework provides an effective mechanism for Torres Strait Islander traditional inhabitants to express their concerns and does not consider that modifications to the Treaty itself are required.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With regard to the health conditions in the Western Province of Papua New Guinea, the PNG Government has recently indicated that improvements to health infrastructure at Daru are to be carried out utilising Japanese and/or Asian Development Bank assistance. The Australian Government is also looking at ways in which it may be able to assist the PNG Government in the development of the infrastructure of Western Province. Australia has agreed that $A200,000 should be made available from the 1990 Structural Adjustment Grant to improve hospital facilities in Daru. We will continue to look for opportunities in which Australia might make a further contribution and we will continue to remind Papua New Guinea of our interest in providing development assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is conscious of Australia's and Papua New Guinea's obligations under the Torres Strait Treaty to take preventative and control measures necessary to protect and preserve the marine environment in, and in the vicinity of, the Torres Strait Protected Zone. The Government endorses the Committee's views on the need to monitor the impact of mining operations on the environment and agrees that safeguard requirements for the prevention of environmental damage should be clearly stipulated in mining agreements. In 1989, the Government commenced a four-year environmental study to identify existing environmental conditions in the Torres Strait, and examine the possible effects of mining activity in the Fly River catchment area on the Torres Strait marine environment. The study, which is called the Torres Strait Baseline Study, is managed by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. Preliminary results of the study are expected by the middle of 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">- CUSTOMS, QUARANTINE AND IMMIGRATION&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 13</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also recommends that the Australian Government negotiate with the Papua New Guinea Government to establish tighter systems of quarantine and immigration control in the Torres Strait.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 19</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee supports the increase in customs and coast watch activities in north Queensland and recommends continued liaison with and assistance to Papua New Guinea customs and police forces. The report looks at aid in these areas in Section 4.4 below and in Chapter 12. (note related issues, perhaps add an extra para from report to set recommendation in context)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 20</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee further recommends that the Australian Customs Service strengthen the liaison and develop further co-operative systems with their opposite agencies in Papua New Guinea and Indonesia in order to monitor breaches of customs and quarantine regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 21</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that AIDAB evaluate the present Customs Project, and report to Parliament with recommendations for the continued co-operation between enforcement agencies in both Papua New Guinea and Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government acknowledges that some improvement in existing border controls in the Torres Strait is necessary and has initiated a number of measures aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of the current system. The Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs has begun to raise its profile in the region and under new arrangements, Islander monitoring officers will undergo training programs designed to help them better understand their responsibilities and powers. In addition the department's capacity to store and retrieve information on the level and pattern of movement of traditional visitors will be strengthened and there will be increased availability of education programs on immigration regulations in the Torres Strait region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With regard to Australia's quarantine strategy for the Torres Strait, the Government considers that quarantine controls are being implemented satisfactorily. The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) has developed a strong working relationship with its PNG counterparts with respect to quarantine management. Technical arrangements for a revised memorandum of understanding with Papua New Guinea concerning quarantine matters are currently under consideration. The Government supports the Committee's recommendation for an increase in Customs and Coastwatch activities in North Queensland. The Australian Customs Service is currently looking into the means by which this might be achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Strong links have been established between Australian and PNG Customs agencies through regular contact between officers and the provision of technical cooperation and training. The AIDAB Customs Project has been particularly useful in the ongoing development of these links. The Government considers that additional measures to increase the level of cooperation are not required at this time, although we do agree with the Committee that existing liaison/cooperation arrangements in the fields of both Customs and Police should continue, subject to normal review conditions being satisfied. AIDAB will prepare later this year, in consultation with the PNG Government, an evaluation and report on the Customs project.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">REGIONAL AFFAIRS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 53</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that Australia encourage and facilitate Papua New Guinea's taking an active role in relation to the smaller South Pacific island states, in providing training opportunities and modest numbers of technicians and professional people, as a contribution to broader solidarity within the Forum group of countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 55</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee believes it is important to Australia's relations with both Indonesia and Papua New Guinea that the Treaty of Mutual Respect continue to work harmoniously, and would encourage actions which strengthen it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government supports the Committee's recommendations on Papua New Guinea's regional affairs and works closely with the PNG Government as it strengthens and diversifies Papua New Guinea's political, economic and security links. Australia has welcomed the Treaty of Mutual Respect, Cooperation and Friendship that was signed on 27 October 1986 by the Papua New Guinea and Indonesian Foreign Ministers and is encouraged by the increasing cooperation between Papua New Guinea and Indonesia on border matters, including through the consultative mechanisms established under their Joint Border Agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government currently provides financial assistance which facilitates the PNG Government's ability to provide training and support to other South Pacific nations. Under AIDAB's Third Country Training program, over 100 students from the South Pacific region are studying in tertiary institutions in Papua New Guinea.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AIDAB's institution strengthening projects are another way in which Australia has been able to help Papua New Guinea play a more active role in the region. As PNG government departments and agencies develop their capacity and technical proficiency, they will be able to offer assistance to other nations. The support recently provided to  the PNG Bureau of Customs and Excise (BCE) through the AIDAB Customs Project is one example of the effectiveness of this sort of assistance. As a result of Australia's assistance the BCE has been able to take an active role in the provision of training assistance to other South Pacific Island states. The BCE has also taken a leading role in the development of the Customs Heads of Administration Regional Meeting which is active in the developing regional cooperation in the customs field.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of Senator MacGibbon, I present a report on the visit of the Defence Sub-committee to Exercise Kangaroo 92. I seek leave to incorporate a tabling statement in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I present the report of the Committee entitled Report on the Visit of the Defence Sub-Committee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade to Exercise Kangaroo 92, 19&mdash;21 March 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, at the invitation of the Minister for Defence, the Defence Sub-Committee attended Exercise Kangaroo 92 for the period 19&mdash;21 March 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The objectives of Exercise Kangaroo 92 and the conduct of the Exercise were communicated to Members of the Sub-Committee at an initial Exercise Concept briefing in Darwin. The Sub-Committee was then provided with opportunities to visit Headquarters Northern Command (including the Joint Operations Centre and the Land, Air and Maritime Component Operations Rooms), the SAS (Special Air Service) Squadron, 1 Media Support Unit and 1 Logistics Support Group. The Sub-Committee was flown by Caribou aircraft to Timber Creek, where 2 Cavalry Regiment was deployed, and to RAAF Base Tindal to observe the activities of 1 Field Hospital Unit. At Tindal we were also briefed on the 3rd Royal Australian Regiment Parachute Battalion Group and the role of No 75 Squadron in Exercise Kangaroo 92.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The visit, though brief, impressed upon the Sub-Committee some of the fundamental difficulties faced by the Australian Defence Force in operating in the north. Temperatures were high and conditions humid throughout our visit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note, Mr President, the comments of the Chief of the Defence Force (CDF) on the lessons learnt from the Exercise. These include the need for ADF personnel to be better acclimatised, although of the 12,000 troops deployed less than one percent were in fact treated for heat stress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, during our inspection of the vehicles and equipment of 26 Transport Squadron 30 Terminal Squadron, we were told that drivers had had to endure temperatures of up to 58 degrees Celsius in the cabins of the vehicles. Conditions inside the tanks and armoured vehicles of 2 Cavalry Regiment were no more comfortable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nature of the terrain in which members of our Defence Force have to operate was again brought home to the Sub-Committee during the visit to Timber Creek. As you are aware, Mr President, the Sub-Committee has recently focused its attention on the north through its inspections of northern Defence units and establishments in August and October last year. Members appreciate not only the enormity of northern Australia but also the wide variety of terrain in which the ADF will increasingly need to operate as significant elements of the ADF are relocated in the north. Members therefore understand the difficulties encountered in moving troops and supplies in such conditions and endorse the remarks of the CDF on the need for Chinook helicopters to carry fuel and troops.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The visit to Kangaroo 92 served to make the Sub-Committee aware of several limitations which had to be taken into consideration by the ADF in the organisation the Exercise. We were told, for  example, that the operations of the Logistics Support Group were affected by State regulations pertaining to the transfer of fresh food, particularly fruit and vegetables, across State boundaries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consideration also has to be given by the ADF to national parks and Aboriginal sacred sites. With respect to areas in which there exist Aboriginal sacred sites, the Sub-Committee was told that there is no universal approach by Land Councils to restricting military access to such areas. Some Land Councils prohibit specific sites whereas others impose a blanket prohibition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Members of the Sub-Committee welcomed the opportunities provided by their attendance at K92 to inspect equipment which is currently being procured by the ADF. Indeed, the visit to K92 served to complement briefings which have been provided to the Sub-Committee in other forums. For instance, Members have been briefed on the Steyr rifle; visits such as the one to K92 give Members access to a variety of viewpoints on the capabilities of that weapon. We were also interested to obtain comment on the performance of the Perentie Long Range Patrol Vehicle, the SAS water operations equipment and communications systems such as RAVEN.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the viewpoint of the Sub-Committee, there was much to be gained from seeing units in operational mode and speaking to ADF personnel. The Sub-Committee was made aware of concerns that low flying intruding aircraft cannot be detected without the employment of Airborne Early Warning and Control aircraft. Again, I note the comments of the CDF that the Exercise demonstrated the need for airborne early warning and control aircraft to more precisely target information from surveillance systems such as the Jindalee Over-the-Horizon Radar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time of our visit, 1 Field Hospital was packing up to move out of the operational area of the Exercise. This gave us a good appreciation of the mobility and sophistication of medical facilities available to the ADF on operations. We were similarly impressed by the `state-of-the-art' technology used by the Media Support Unit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the 5th Aviation Regiment's participation in Exercise Kangaroo 92. The exercise was the first full regiment level operation for the new unit. Therefore it was the Regiment's first opportunity to demonstrate its achievements of the last four years. It now provides substantial air mobility to the ODF by day and by night. For example, the Regiment inserted two infantry battalions on Melville Island, one at night in two large scale air mobile assaults using vision devices, a first for the ADF. It then contributed to the amphibious tactical lodgement of another battalion from HMAS Tobruk and Jervis Bay landing soldiers and equipment at the rate of one aircraft per minute. It also showed the ability to conduct major repair and maintenance operations in the most remote of bush locations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This exercise proved that a new level of air mobility now exists in the ADF. The 5th Aviation Regiment will achieve its final operational objective on November 20 1992 when it demonstrates to the Australian public the ability to carry an infantry company group in one lift.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Inspections made by the Sub-Committee frequently complement inquiries being conducted by the Sub-Committee. This visit to K92 proved no exception. Our itinerary included briefings by 1 Logistics Support Group and 2 Field Supply Battalion (Logistics Support Group), which provided Members with opportunities to raise issues which are relevant to the Sub-Committee's inquiry into ADF Stockholding Policies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Throughout the visit we were highly impressed by the professionalism, dedication and enthusiasm of the members of the ADF for the tasks and responsibilities which were entrusted to them. From our own observations, we would concur with the CDF's judgment that the exercise was a very successful one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, may I publicly express our appreciation for the opportunity to attend Exercise Kangaroo 92 and for the efforts those who contributed to the success of our visit.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak tonight about a report of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training which was tabled late last year. It slipped off the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>, as these things sometimes do, when I was otherwise engaged. Therefore I am taking this opportunity to make some comments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report, which is very appropriately titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Come In Cinderella</EMPHASIS>, deals with the growth and importance of adult and community education in Australia. This has truly been the Cinderella sector of education, at least in terms of public recognition and funding, although the many thousands of Australians who make use of it certainly understand its value. Responses I have received from constituents since the report was tabled have all been positive and bear that out. In tabling the report, Senator Aulich said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Until we began our investigation into adult and community education we had little idea either of the scope of the sector or of the significance of its contribution to the educational, economic and social wellbeing of the nation and to individual participants</PARA>
<PARA>.I have a slightly different slant on the contents of this report because I have had a long association with the adult and community education sector and continue to have regular contact both with the relatively more formal providers, such as neighbourhood houses and learning centres, and with the less formalised groups, such as the University of the Third Age, local women's groups, library support groups, parent groups, et cetera. I find the University of the Third Age groups particularly stimulating. They consist mainly of older people with very varied life experiences which they can contribute to the work of the groups. For some of the students, these groups are the basis of maintaining links and making new ones with people of similar interests in their community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My experience, dating back many years, with two pioneering community providers in Victoria&mdash;the Diamond Valley Learning Centre and the Eltham Living and Learning Centre&mdash;as student, committee member and occasional teacher, convinced me long ago that adult and community education deserves much greater support. From my experience as a former teacher and student counsellor, I am more positive than is implied in some parts of this report about the relationship between the schools sector and the provision of adult and community education. When I worked at the then Montmorency High School&mdash;now the Montmorency Secondary College&mdash;in Victoria we had strong links with the local learning centres. In fact, the parent-teacher organisation ran its own evening classes which were open to both parents and students studying together. I am also aware that many schools make their buildings, libraries and equipment available to parent and other adult groups. In Victoria, many adults study at senior secondary level in schools, not just in evening classes but also in day time classes, with teenage students. I can remember in my own school a parent and a daughter in the same year 11 maths class. I believe it is probable that this will become more common in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember returning as an adult to a daytime university class where I was one of only two mature age students in a group of about 300. That was about 25 years ago. These days mature age students do not get the curious looks that we got then. I believe that the same acceptance will come in the secondary area. One of the reasons for this belief&mdash;and I am speaking solely of the Victorian situation because that is the one that I know well&mdash;is that the teaching and learning styles many adult education providers believe to be specific to adults are exactly those which effective teachers use in schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I quote briefly from an appendix in the report which describes an educational perspective claimed to be unique to the Cinderella sector:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This perspective:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">places the learner at the centre of the educational experience as opposed to the content of the learning or the expertise of the educator or the accepted ideas about a particular field of study;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">acknowledges the independence of the learner as a mature human being and regards learners as capable of, and responsible for, making decisions about their own learning needs;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">emphasises holistic considerations which take account of the social situation of learners, their life experiences, dispositions or disabilities; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">de-emphasises notions of the educator as authority and promotes a relation of equality among the participants.</PARA>
<PARA>With a few minor word changes, this statement applies equally to best and widely accepted practice in schools. It is ironic that the other adult education sector, known as higher education, often falls short of those standards, being frequently more teacher-centred and traditional in its methodology than its parallel either in adult and community education or in our schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs, which I chair, has just completed a long and very full inquiry into the employment of people with disabilities. We have found that one of the barriers to entry to employment of people with disabilities is the lack of basic education or appropriate education and training. The more informal atmosphere of a neighbourhood house is often less threatening and more suitable than a more formal educational provision for someone whose education was minimal, if any, or was a long time ago. These centres offer a way in, as they do for many other adults returning to education after long periods away from school or paid employment through illness, unemployment or child rearing. In recent years I have been very impressed by the work done to enable people with disabilities to access employment or proceed to further education when they and those who know them may have believed that impossible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another group which needs assistance to be able to take advantage of adult and community education consists of those with preschool children in their full time care. The provision of child-care facilities at or close to the adult learning centre is vital for these women and men. I draw the attention of honourable senators to recommendation 7 of the report, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that whenever government agencies provide a grant to adult and community education providers for the delivery of a particular program that grant shall include, as a matter of course, a component specifically to provide for child care.</PARA>
<PARA>There are many important recommendations in the report. I do not propose to go into them, but they have my wholehearted support, as does the call to `Come in, Cinderella'. I hope that everyone with an interest in this fourth sector of education&mdash;particularly the State and Federal governments and agencies&mdash;will read the report, if they have not done so already, and heed the call to `Come in, Cinderella' by supporting the recommendations with action. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I  bring to the attention of the Senate tonight a circumstance which arose upon the retirement of Mr G.E. Boucher&mdash;Mr Graham Boucher&mdash;from the Public Service. It is a matter about which I would have asked a question except that too much information would need to be provided, so I seek to place my question before the Minister in this fashion. I will not read out all the correspondence that I have.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Boucher retired voluntarily in 1989, having spent 30 years in the Public Service. He was working with the Australian Customs Service. Subsequently, he has had correspondence with and a case before the Merit Protection and Review Agency relating to the calculation of his recreation leave entitlements at that stage. I refer to the document from the Merit Protection and Review Agency which says, in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . on 29 November 1989 Mr Boucher wrote to the ACS referring to previous correspondence about an amount of $690 which he claimed had been unfairly deducted from the recreation leave credits on his retirement. He asked that the matter be referred to the Agency.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the Merit Protection and Review Agency. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 28 December 1989, ACS wrote to Mr Boucher advising him that it had sought from the DOF a payment which had been calculated as $691.81;</PARA>
<PARA>This arises from something of an anomaly in the Public Service Act, one which I believe there have been two attempts to correct since this time. The recommendation of the Agency, which was dated 19 February 1991, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is recommended that the Agency conclude that the application of section 68A of the Public Service Act to Mr Boucher was unfair and inequitable and advise Mr Boucher, DIR, DOF and ACS of that conclusion. It is further recommended that the Agency suggest that DIR and DOF consider the best available means of compensating Mr Boucher and that they consider whether the grievance has illustrated a problem having a more general impact and, if so, how best to resolve it.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GRIEVANCE BY MR G BOUCHER</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Background</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Boucher voluntarily retired from the Australian Customs Service (ACS) on 3 March 1989. He had been in the Public Service since 24 November l958. Upon his retirement, he was paid an amount in respect of recreation leave accrued up to the date of retirement but not taken at that time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. Because he was an officer who had been employed prior to 26 October 1966 and who retired prior to the anniversary of his commencement, section 68A of the Public Service Act 1922 applied to Mr Boucher. Insofar as it relevant, section 68A provides:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"(2) In the case of an officer to whom this section applies, the recreation leave credit that accrued to the officer on 1 January in the year in which he ceases to be an officer shall be deemed to have been so much of that credit as does not exceed a period calculated at the rate of one-twelfth of that credit for each complete month for which the officer has continued in the Service beyond the anniversary of the date on which he commenced duties as an officer that last preceded the date on which he ceases to be an officer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. Section 68A was inserted into the Public Service Act to adjust entitlements affected by the decision (effective from 1 January 1967) that the recreation leave accrual date should be 1 January rather than the anniversary of commencement. The effect of that change was that officers were overcredited in 1967 by varying proportions of annual recreation leave entitlement based on the period between the anniversary of commencement occurring in 1966 and 1 January 1967. Recreation leave entitlement increased from 15 to 20 days per annum during the period of Mr Boucher's service (in 1973).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. As applied to Mr Boucher, the provision would require that his recreation leave credit for 1989 should be 1/12 of 20 days for each full month after the last anniversary of his commencement (24 November 1988) and before his retirement (3 March 1989). There are 3 full months (December, January and February) in that period and so the credit would be 5 days. Had Mr Boucher been appointed after 26 October 1966, his recreation leave entitlement accruing on 1 January 1989 would have been 20 days (although he would not then have been advantaged by the overcrediting on 1 January 1967) and he would also have received an amount in respect of January and February 1989.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5. The problem which led to Mr Boucher receiving a smaller credit than would have been available had a pro rata adjustment been made in 1967 is not complex. It can be analysed in the way adopted by ACS in its approach to DOF for an act of grace payment. That method leads to a calculation of:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">accrued credit (gross of 1967 overcredit, adjustment and 1989 pro-rata entitlement) of 59 days, 2 hours and 27 minutes;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">an adjustment based on cancelling the January 1989 recreation leave accrual (20 days), cancelling the pro-rata adjustment for the period since January 1989 (3 days, 2 hours and 27 minutes) and adding a credit based on the period of service between the anniversary and the date of retirement (5 days). That leads to a net figure of 41 days to be paid in lieu; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a notional period based on what Mr Boucher's recreation leave credit would have been had a pro-rata adjustment been made on 1 January 1967. This amount comes to 45 days, 4 hours and 17 minutes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The difference between the periods calculated using the adjustment and the notional period is 4 days, 4 hours and 17 minutes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6. Expressed in other terms:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the overcredit provided to all officers on 1 January 1967 was based on an annual entitlement of 15 days, whereas the adjustment is based on an annual entitlement of 20 days;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">in Mr Boucher's case, he was overcredited by 13.75 days on 1 January 1967 (11/12 of the year's entitlement which would otherwise have accrued on the anniversary of his commencement);</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">but the adjustment effected on his retirement had the effect of reducing his 1989 entitlement by 15 days (recreation leave in respect of one year, less the three months he worked between the anniversary of his commencement and his retirement) This created a discrepancy of 1.25 days; which</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">was increased by 3.33 days, the amount which would have been accrued in respect of January and February 1989.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The total loss calculated in this way is 4.58 days, which converts approximately to 4 days, 4 hours and 16 minutes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Grievance</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7. The history of the handling of this matter is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">on 15 August 1989, the Department of Industrial Relations (DIR) wrote to ACS about the operation of section 68A. The memorandum acknowledged that, due to the change in the amount of leave credited annually, entitlements would not necessarily correspond with the period of service. DIR indicated it was aware of the anomaly and was reviewing the situation, although retrospective resolution was not envisaged;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">on 28 September 1989, DIR wrote to Mr Boucher referring to a letter he had sent on 29 August 1989. DIR acknowledged being aware that section 68A could be detrimental to officers in certain circumstances and indicated that, although the matter was being reviewed, retrospective correction of the situation was not envisaged. The letter indicated that an approach might be made to the Department of Finance (DOF) for a payment under subsection 90(3) of the Public Service Act;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">on 29 November 1989, Mr Boucher wrote to ACS referring to previous correspondence about an amount of $690 which he claimed had been unfairly deducted from the recreation leave credits paid on his retirement. He asked that the matter be referred to the Agency;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">on 28 December 1989, ACS wrote to Mr Boucher advising him that it had sought from DOF a payment which had been calculated as $691.81;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">on the same date, ACS wrote to DOF seeking an act of grace payment under section 34A of the Audit Act 1901. The submission set out the varying bases of calculation (discussed below) and indicated there was a discrepancy of 4 days, 4 hours and 17 minutes; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">on 26 March 1990, DOF advised ACS that it had declined to approve the act of grace payment to Mr Boucher. DOF noted that DIR did not intend retrospective resolution of the anomaly. It suggested that, as there had been and would be other officers in the same position as Mr Boucher, it was difficult to see why he should be singled out for special treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8. On 16 May 1990, ACS completed the referral of the grievance</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to the Agency. It had deferred doing this pending DOF's</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">consideration of the case. ACS referred to contact with DOF</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">subsequent to DOF's memorandum of 26 March 1990 in which ACS had attempted to put further material to DOF.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agency action</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9. On 4 September 1990, the Agency's Assistant Director wrote to DOF, setting out his understanding of the case and expressing the opinion that DOF's arguments against an act of grace payment were unconvincing. The memorandum noted that a request for an act of grace payment was necessary only because there was not to be retrospective application of the solution to the anomaly and that it was irrelevant to the merits of Mr Boucher's case that other officers in his position had not sought to make a similar approach. The memorandum set out the object for which the Agency had been established ("to ensure that actions taken and decisions made in relation to a Commonwealth employee . . . are fair and equitable") and suggested that the result of the application of section 68A to Mr Boucher did not meet that standard. The Assistant Director indicated that an act of grace payment would resolve the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">10. On 19 September 1990, DOF replied to the memorandum. It declined again to make an act of grace payment, noting that DIR could resolve the problem retrospectively. It suggested that, if DIR would not propose such a solution, or if the Parliament would not agree to it, it would not be appropriate to circumvent the application of the legislation by reliance on the act of grace power. It indicated that a retrospective application of the solution to the anomaly would resolve the problem for all former officers affected by it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">11. I spoke to DIR about the matter on 27 September 1990 and was told that DIR opposed retrospectivity in this instance on administrative grounds (the need to identify potential claimants and publicise the change) and because of the general policy against retrospectivity. DIR saw that policy as applying even where the Commonwealth was the only person or body likely to be disadvantaged. DIR was to discuss a case similar to Mr Boucher's with DOF. That discussion did not lead to a resolution of Mr Boucher's problem, since it concerned a case where a payment had been calculated and made without reference to section 68A.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Analysis</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">12. The period calculated in paragraph 5 and checked in paragraph 6 represents the difference between:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the recreation leave credit which would have been provided to Mr Boucher had a pro-rata adjustment been made when the decision was taken to convert to accrual of recreation leave on 1 January in each year; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the recreation leave credit actually available after adjustment for overcrediting and related to the increase in the accrual rate of recreation leave.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Its effect is that Mr Boucher was denied, on his retirement, payment in respect of the recreation leave entitlement which would have been accrued in a period of almost three months.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">13. Mr Boucher's loss, and the losses incurred by other former officers affected in this way by section 68A, resulted from a combination of:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the decision in 1966/67 to take what may have been the administratively more simple approach of providing an overcredit, rather than making a set of calculations to establish a pro rata credit in 1967 based on uncredited service in 1966; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">what appears to have been an oversight in failing to look to the consequences of that choice when the rate of recreation leave accrual was increased.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The issue raised by the grievance relates to whether an officer appointed under the Public Service Act should be entitled to accrual of recreation leave in respect of his or her whole period of service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">14. As was pointed out to DOF in the Agency's letter of 4 September 1990, the Agency was established with the object of ensuring:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"that actions taken and decisions made in relation to a Commonwealth employee in relation to his employment as a Commonwealth employee are fair and equitable and are taken or made in accordance with sound personnel management practices and with due regard being had to&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) the efficiency of the relevant authority; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) the need to ensure good relations between the relevant authority and its employees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">15. In relation to employment grievances, this general purpose finds specific expression in subsection 51(4) of the Act which sets out the bases on which the Agency may report to a Department or authority. Insofar as is relevant, that subsection provides that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Where . . . the Agency is of the opinion, having regard to the objects referred to in subsection 4(1), that the relevant action was wrong and that&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) a decision, recommendation, act or omission comprised or included in the relevant action should be referred to the appropriate authority for further consideration; . . . </PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) a rule of law, provision of an enactment or industrial award or practice on which a decision, recommendation, act or omission was based should be altered; . . .</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Agency may report accordingly . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">16. Clearly, a situation where some employees receive on resignation or retirement an amount reflecting all their previous service and others do not is inequitable. Legislation which can lead to such divergent results based on the interplay of the anniversary of the date of commencement and the date of resignation or retirement (when such an interplay has no sound logical basis) is obviously anomalous and requires amendment or other action to mitigate its past and future consequences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">17. How such mitigation might be achieved is not a matter for determination by the Agency, but one which properly belongs to the bodies able to rectify it&mdash;in this case DIR and DOF. The answers which suggest themselves to me would involve either:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">prospective legislation with act of grace adjustment to any past cases which come to notice; or</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">retrospective legislation, with the onus on former employees affected by the provision to identify themselves and substantiate their claims.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There may be other ways of dealing with the problem, but a report dealing with the position of an individual employee is not the appropriate place to address what is really an administrative problem which should be resolved by the bodies responsible for it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">18. Neither of these proposals would be completely "fair" in that they would relatively advantage those former employees who have previously or who now bring themselves to attention. They would, however, recognise and give weight to the practical administrative difficulties faced by employers administering the provision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">19. It is recommended that the Agency conclude that the application of section 68A of the Public Service Act to Mr Boucher was unfair and inequitable and advise Mr Boucher, DIR, DOF and ACS of that conclusion. It is further recommended that the Agency suggest that DIR and DOF consider the best available means of compensating Mr Boucher and that they consider whether the grievance has illustrated a problem having a more general impact and, if so, how best to resolve it.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your grievance about the amount paid in lieu of recreation leave on your retirement from the Australian Customs Service in March 1989.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you are aware the Agency has been waiting for a response from the Department of Industrial Relations to the Agency's report on the grievance. That response has now been received. The Department has advised that it does not agree that your case alone represents an anomaly (which the Agency never claimed). The Department has further advised that while it is acknowledged that the adjustment of recreation leave on retirement has a different impact depending on the officer's commencement date and his choice of date of retirement it cannot be said in logic to be inherently anomalous or inequitable. (The Agency's view is that whether or not the adjustment is anomalous or inequitable in logic, it would appear to be so in practice.)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However the Department has also advised that section 68A of the Public Service Act has been under review for some time with the objective of providing the best means of dealing with unintended effects resulting from the current application of section 68A for officers in the Service (which would seem to indicate that the Department accepts that there are problems with the provision).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency intends to pursue the matter to ensure that the review is carried out quickly and that, if changes are made, they are retrospective so that your situation, and the situation of others like you, is corrected.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Adjustment of recreation leave for officers who commenced duty as officers before 26 October 1966.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Industrial Relations by Public Service Determination 1992/27 signed on 9 March 1992 converted the authority for recreation leave from the Public Service Act and regulations to Determination 1983/10.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Industrial Relations advised that the basis for the conversion is that the new provisions are no less favourable than the terms and conditions previously applicable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What the Department fails to advise is that Clause 11.1 of Determination 1992/27 is actually an amendment to correct an anomaly which existed in subsection 68A(2) of the Act. The relevant Explanatory Memorandum to Determination 1992/27 omits information about the 7000 officers who have retired from the Commonwealth Public Service subsequent to introduction of 4 weeks (20 days) recreation leave in the mid-nineteen seventies, and who were affected by the anomaly by as much as one weeks recreation leave credit being `clawed back' at retirement. Determination 1992/27 corrects the anomaly for future retiring officers but makes no retrospective adjustment for past retired officers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This matter has been the subject of an investigation and report by the Merit Protection and Review Agency following my lodging a `GRIEVANCE' with the Agency after my voluntary retirement from the Australian Customs Service (30 years) on 3 March 1989. The Agency adopted the report (copy enclosed) and the recommendation made in it, which reads</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">19.It is recommended that the Agency conclude that the application of section 68A of the Public Service Act to Mr Boucher was unfair and inequitable and advise Mr Boucher of that conclusion. It is further recommended that the Agency suggest that DIR and DOF consider the best available means of compensating Mr Boucher and that they consider whether the grievance has illustrated a problem having a more general impact and, if so, how best to resolve it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prior to my lodging the grievance with the Agency, I had been informed by the Department of Industrial Relations that it had been aware of the anomaly for some considerable time and that the `clawed-back' amount ($691) would be recovered to me by an `Act of Grace payment'. The Department advised me appropriate wording to formalise the request for an `Act of Grace payment' to be lodged by the Australian Customs Service, supported by the Department of Industrial Relations; to the Department of Finance. The Department of Finance rejected this ad hoc approach in favour of a more general provision to correct the anomaly ie. the measure should allow recovery of money by all officers affected by the anomaly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Merit Protection and Review Agency wrote to me on 10 December 1991 (copy enclosed) informing me of the current position, the Agency's disagreement with views expressed by the Department of Industrial Relations and that the Agency would continue to pursue the matter so that "if changes are made, they are retrospective so that your situation, and the situation of others like you, is corrected."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, it appears that clause 11.1 of Determination 1992/27 has been prepared without consultation with the Agency as I contacted relevant officers and they were not aware of the Department of Industrial Relations action. Like myself the Agency had been kept in the dark!</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On Wednesday 15 April I met with Ms Shirley Pipitone, Director DIR to express my disappointment that my letter of 6 March 1992 had not been acknowledged and that I had become aware of the determination which did not have retrospective provisions to correct the anomaly. Ms Pipitone informed me, inter alia, that Determination 1992/27 was in fact faulty and a new Determination 1992/46 was now to replace it when signed. It would not however improve my situation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Failure by the Department of Industrial Relations to adequately address the matter in the relevant Explanatory Memorandum is misleading and must be of concern to yourself, Senators of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee, and ultimately the Parliament. The Department acknowledged that it is embarrassed by its failure to take corrective action years ago and that this has exacerbated the problem. Converting authority from the Public Service Act, subsection 68A(2), to Determination 1983/10 provided a convenient covert opportunity to make change without an amending Bill and wider scrutiny by the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly clause 11.1 of Determination 1992/27 causes a further anomaly rather than correcting the earlier anomaly and I ask that you have the matter investigated with a view to having it amended or disallowed and replaced with provisions that restore fairness, natural justice and equitable treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would be pleased to provide additional information or meet with you or your staff if it would assist. I can be contacted at home on (06)2812827.</PARA>

<PARA>What it really amounts to is that a public servant, after some 30 years of service, has retired and there is an amount of some $690 outstanding in relation to his recreation leave which, quite clearly, the Merit Protection and Review Agency says was unfairly deducted from his moneys. He has not yet received this or any interest upon it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He, of course, could not possibly justify spending the money that he would need to spend to take the Government to court over the deduction. In fact, I have referred in this place to other matters involving people who have attempted to take the Government to court for small amounts and who have seen that the Government is prepared to spend unlimited amounts on legal expenses. So there is no way that anyone could possibly suggest to Mr Boucher that he seek a remedy of that kind. But the amount involved obviously is seen by some as so small as to be absolutely insignificant. If that is the case, why do the people concerned not just deal with it and get rid of the matter and treat a public servant, who has given service for a long time, properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My question to the Minister for Finance, which I hope will be conveyed to him, is: will he examine this matter I have referred to and make sure that justice is done and that this man is treated fairly?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to conclude some comments I was making in the matters of public interest discussion at lunchtime in relation to the Government's response to the report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to commence my comments tonight by briefly speaking of the state of Aboriginal affairs in Western Australia. Western Australia, as I think most honourable senators would know, has the highest rate of Aboriginal arrest and detention in Australia, and is probably also the State in which Aborigines come up against powerful vested interests in pursuing issues of redress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Probably the most contentious issue in the State of Western Australia is land rights where, of course, Aborigines come up against both pastoral and mining industries. I well recall the campaign that was conducted by the Mining Council of Australia when the Western Australian Government was planning to introduce land rights legislation. In evidence before the recent Senate Select Committee on Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures, broadcaster Phillip Adams described the Mining Council's ad campaign as the worst he had seen in Australia. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have never forgotten it. It showed a black hand building a wall of bricks across Western Australia. It was photographed in such a way as to make the black hand as terrifying as the grim reaper. It had little to do with truth and it was reprehensible. . . What Aboriginal group in Australia could afford to raise the money to say, `Hey. That is not our position on land rights'?.</PARA>
<PARA>I think this ad campaign was illustrative of the powerful and moneyed forces Aborigines have ranged against them as soon as they demand anything more than just a pat on the head. The campaign's very success in rousing the community&mdash;it is credited, I might say, with scuttling the legislation in Western Australia&mdash;shows how close below the surface paranoid attitudes on Aboriginal issues still lurk in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are, of course, the attitudes which are being addressed, I hope successfully, in the reconciliation process. Land rights is an issue which does, I think it is fair to say, scare many Australians, but for a people so absolutely dispossessed it is a central and crucial issue. I believe that without satisfactory resolution of this issue the process as a whole cannot succeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the British settled Australia, they described their action as occupation which was legally defined as `the appropriate modality where the territory was uninhabited or where the inhabitants were deemed not to possess any form of organised political society'. The British classified Australian Aboriginal tribes as fitting into the latter category. I think they also had a quid on the first category in describing Australia as terra nullius, that is, as unoccupied land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this basis, they believed there was no need to treaty with the tribes or to have any form of negotiations with them. We know now, or perhaps most of us do, that not only did Aboriginal tribes have a complex and unique system of society and politics, but they also had a definite relationship with the land that was more than the spiritual relationship that is often cited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sydney University academic Keith Suter puts it this way:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Aborigines were nomads because they knew that this was the best way to avoid over-exploiting the natural resources. But they were not aimless wanderers; they had set routes within their tribal areas. This concept of lifestyle was alien to 18th century Europeans, who claimed that these were just savages who knew no better.</PARA>
<PARA>I think we all know how systematically Aborigines were killed once the inward push for land was on. As Keith Suter points out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Aborigines were killed not because they were black or savage but because they owned the land. Australia was not `terra nullius'.</PARA>
<PARA>Nevertheless, this concept of terra nullius was used as the justification for the taking of land from Aborigines willy-nilly on the basis that they did not occupy it in a sense that was recognised by British law. Indeed, there was an unquestioning imposition of British law and justice on peoples who had their own well developed system of justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other myth is still perpetuated. That is, that Aborigines had the land for 40,000 years and, so to speak, did nothing with it and so do not deserve to have it. I am sure that we have all had that view put to us by someone over the years. If doing something with the land means clearing and developing marginal and fragile country, introducing ecologically disastrous animal and plant species, eroding vast amounts of country, salinating major waterways, driving species of native animals to extinction and decimating our tree population, then obviously the Aboriginal inhabitants did do nothing. Frankly, we can all breathe a sigh of relief that that was the case, and how lucky that was for our continent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some Aboriginal activists believe that a formal recognition of Aboriginal prior ownership of this country and Aboriginal sovereign law are essential issues for a serious recognition of Aboriginal rights. The need for a compact, treaty, makarrata, or whatever it might be called, is to be determined as part of the consultations in the reconciliation process. We certainly have the evidence before us, though, of the dire consequences of the initial failure to recognise ownership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My own view is that the need is more to establish that we do not need such a treaty. It is easy to see why there is opposition to a treaty. As long as Aborigines only have a moral claim to redress, they are obviously in a much weaker position to achieve their demands. A treaty recognising prior ownership of the land gives them a legal as well as a moral claim, which ups the ante enormously. A moral claim can be disregarded; a legal claim cannot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The political tide is inexorably sweeping us towards having to deal seriously with the fundamental issues involved in righting the wrongs of dispossession and disadvantage. The Aboriginal community is now more politically active and better organised than it has ever been and Aboriginal people now expect change. They expect a decent and self-sufficient life for their people and they are entitled to it. The circumstances faced by Aborigines are common to many displaced indigenous peoples around the world. It is true to say that the establishment of the royal commission itself, the response to the royal commission and the current reconciliation process are probably the most comprehensive attempt anywhere to tackle these problems. We must achieve concrete results so that the royal commission does not go down in history as a $30m job creation program mainly for whites and lawyers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time of the bicentennial celebrations many Aborigines found it ironic that they were expected to celebrate 200 years of white settlement. It was to their own great credit&mdash;and to the pleasure of many non-Aboriginal Australians as well&mdash;that they turned this resentment, at least in Sydney where white settlement first took place, into positive action during the bicentennial celebrations. They achieved this by organising events which&mdash;whilst making a definite statement that white settlement had not been a cause for celebration for them&mdash;affirmed the cohesiveness and value of Aboriginal culture and society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as I am concerned, a permanent establishment of the feelings of self-esteem and self-determination that these Koori celebrations generated is the ultimate objective of the current reconciliation process. Such an attitude in the Aboriginal community, combined with the goodwill and participation of the entire Australian community, may achieve genuine reform and redress the ills of the past 200 years. I hope that I have managed to convey a sense of urgency in what I have said, because I genuinely believe that this is the crunch time. I genuinely believe that we have to make this work. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this adjournment debate tonight I want to bring to the attention of the Senate a pathetic story that has occurred in Western Australia at the port of Fremantle over the last 24 hours. As this chamber would know very well, I have been a critic of the Government's waterfront reform program and also certain aspects of the industrial relations system that is now operating in this country. I believe this story highlights very clearly what I have been talking about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It concerns a shipping company known as Ocean Bridge Shipping Pty Ltd and a vessel called the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Jill Coast</EMPHASIS>. It concerns the captain of that ship, which is under hire from an overseas company and operating through Ocean Bridge Shipping and it affects the potato industry in Western Australia very greatly. The facts are that the Ocean Bridge Shipping company sought quotes from two stevedoring companies operating on the Fremantle waterfront. One company quoted $30 a tonne to load the potatoes from the Potato Marketing Board onto the ship and the other company quoted $36 per tonne. There was a total of 700 tonnes of potatoes to be shipped to Mauritius. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The captain decided that those prices were excessive and sought an independent quote. As a result, he received a quote of $7.50 per tonne to load the potatoes. If we take the bottom price, that is a difference of $23 per tonne and if we take the higher price, it is a difference of $28 per tonne&mdash;between three and four times as much as the quote from the independent contractor. As a result of him deciding to accept the best quote to load the potatoes, a picket line was immediately placed around his ship by the Waterside Workers Federation in Fremantle. Today he described the picket to me on the telephone as being 20 thugs. He said, `I don't feel safe walking down the gangplank onto the shore'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a very pathetic situation in itself, let alone the difference in the prices quoted. Also, it is one of the reasons why I have been very critical about what has been released up to this point in time concerning the Government's attitude towards contractors. I will not yet make a judgment on the Bill that was introduced tonight, because I have not had time to read it, but when I do, I will. I want to make the point that this particular exercise shows quite clearly the benefits that can be gained from allowing Australia to become internationally competitive across its waterfront. That allows us to become internationally competitive with our products in a significant number of markets around the world&mdash;as I mentioned, this market is Mauritius, but there are others in Asia and other countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, if the growers are given half the difference, they would receive $10 or $15 per tonne more than they are currently receiving. In the medium and longer term this will be the deciding factor in whether or not the potato industry in Western Australia survives. It is of enormous significance to the potato growers and of enormous significance in terms of our ability to penetrate international markets. This really is a pathetic story of stupidity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just want to ask why this shipping company, which was doing nothing illegal, has to put up with this kind of thing. The next part of the story shows how crazy things can become. Upon hearing that a picket line had been formed, the Potato Marketing Board decided that it would not load potatoes onto trucks that were driven by TWU members because those drivers would not go through the picket line. The Board then said to the shipping owner, `Let's forget about your quote. We will deliver those potatoes to the ship. We will have them loaded by one of the stevedoring companies'. Who is going to pick up that cost?  Of course, the growers will have to pick up the cost, and, I emphasise, this will mean reduced returns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would suggest that the interference in the freedom of the Ocean Bridge shipping company and its captain, Captain McKenzie, to get the best commercial price to have this product loaded onto the ship is, at the very least, ludicrous&mdash;one could think of much stronger terminology that could be used. The situation in terms of the way in which he has been intimidated by a picket line being placed around the ship and the fact that it has been allowed to continue is absolutely pathetic. So too is the deal that the Potato Marketing Board has tried to make at the expense of potato growers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This situation highlights the fact that the waterfront reform process in this country is not going very far. It also highlights the fact that contractors can make an enormous contribution to this country in terms of reducing significantly business and operating costs. We need to tackle this issue if this country is to be internationally competitive and if it is to have a slight edge in terms of competing in international markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to put on record tonight that this matter was well reported today. It was widely reported in Western Australia. I believe that the silence of this Government and the Western Australian Government is unbelievable. What has happened is an infringement of the rights of the shipping operators and a direct attack on the returns of growers. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not all positions in the Department are filled at any given time. Positions become vacant as a result of promotions, transfers, secondments and resignations, with the speed of the process of filling vacancies being determined predominantly by whether the vacancy is short term (temporary) or permanent. The process of substantively filling positions, which involves advertising, shortlisting, interviewing and final selection takes some time, generally between six to twelve weeks. This means that at any given time there will always be a proportion of positions in the Library nominally vacant. As an example, at 22 April 1992, seven positions in the Department were in the process of being substantively filled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the Department is staffing direct service areas at a rate above approved ASL, at times gaps in individual specialities may occur through changes in request levels from Senators and Members or through unavoidable staffing changes.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the two direct client service programs, four positions (two in Program 1 and two in Program 2) have not been filled for some time for reasons of salaries management.

The judgement that has been made as to which positions should not be filled in order to keep the Library's salaries expenditure within its salaries budget has been determined on the basis of minimal impact on services to clients. As can be seen from the figures above, the four positions constitute a very small percentage of overall Library staffing.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1 &amp; 2) The Government will respond to the recommendations of the National Plantations Advisory Committee and the specific issues raised by the honourable senator through a National Forests Policy Statement. This Statement will also consider the recommendations arising from the Ecologically Sustainable Development Working Group's report on Forest Use and the Resource Assessment Commission's Forest and Timber Inquiry. The Statement is being jointly prepared by Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments. It is anticipated that it will be made available for public discussion in late May/early June, and that it will be finalised and released in the third quarter of 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The Statement will address issues such as conservation, ecologically sustainable management of native forests and plantations. In relation to logging of native forests the Resource Assessment Commission Inquiry concluded that "the cessation of wood production activities in native forests is not justified on the basis of evidence before it" (page xxxvii, Final Report Vol. 1). The Inquiry also found that "plantations, both hardwood and softwood, will develop under normal market conditions as opportunities are realised" (page 38, Overview) and that the "timber industry must remain dependent, for some time, on the native forest resource" (page 38, Overview).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Ecologically Sustainable Development Working Group on Forest Use also considered the issue of the ecological sustainability of harvesting native forests vis-a-vis sourcing timber needs from plantations. It concluded that "from an ecologically sustainable forest-use viewpoint, so long as appropriate codes of practice are adopted in public and private native forests, there is adequate reservation of all major ecosystems, sustainable yield harvesting is adopted, and that the pricing structure takes into account all costs and values, then the usual market forces should determine the extent to which industry draws upon the various timber sources: public or private, and native [forests] or plantations. This process will also ensure that the community derives the optimum return from use of its public forests. Apart from not being currently economically feasible, obliging industry to source its hardwood sawlog needs from plantations is not a prerequisite to achieving ecologically sustainable forest use" (pages 137-8).</PARA>
