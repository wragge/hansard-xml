<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Now that even Senator Richardson is saying that the Labor Party has to have a convincing fifth term agenda, is it not time to acknowledge the failure of the Labor Government's economic management and put before the people of Australia policies to address the worst recession in 60 years? The Labor legacy will be one million Australians out of work, a $200 billion foreign debt&mdash;$11,000 for every man, woman and child in this country; a tenfold increase since the Labor Party came to government&mdash;and a massive trade deficit which is putting this country further into the red in excess of $1 billion a month.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are by Senator Knowles, it seems. I will go through some of the rhetoric. First of all, it is very easy to describe this recession as our recession. Of course, government policy and many economists in Australia misread the signals at the time as to the depth of the recession. There is no doubt about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition, John Hewson, continued to misread them long after everybody else had stopped by opposing the first six interest rates cuts which we had in 1991. Senators opposite should not come in here with a whole lot of undue piety about all these issues as if they had some particular solutions and the Government has not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing I want to say to Senator Knowles&mdash;I said it last week and I will say it again&mdash;is that any new policies which the Government may or may not announce before the forthcoming election will be announced in the Government's time. They will not be announced in response to opinion polls which the Liberal Party took no notice of for a very long time, but suddenly last Monday the Liberal Party discovered that the recession was deeper than it thought and there would need to be a different response. We await that different response with interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the employment issue is concerned, I have said on numerous occasions that employment will be alleviated when there is increased growth in the Australian economy. We are one of the few economies&mdash;I think one of only three economies&mdash;in the OECD which is actually growing at present. That growth will continue and pick up. There are no magic wands which are going to alleviate unemployment overnight. Those opposite can try to think them up as hard as they like, but they will never arrive at any magic wands which can alleviate these things overnight. I am really repeating the answers I gave to Senator Hill last week. He repeated the question; I am repeating the answer.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will keep a straight face. I thank Senator Macdonald for his advice; it is the first bit of any value I have received. The Government's approach to tariffs reflects the commitment of this Government to what is essentially a pragmatic approach to the problems of different industries in this country. A zero tariff approach, which was espoused at one time by the Opposition, is not one which reflects that degree of pragmatism and the differences which exist between industries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have announced planned and gradual phase-downs in tariff protection for manufacturing industry. We have stuck to them and we will continue to do so. For example, in the car industry we have provided a framework for continuing reform and restructure up to the year 2000. It is a policy which recognises that the automotive industry is part of a global industry in which Australia must have a niche. It is not something which is driven by ideology; it is a policy which reflects, and is reflected in, growing export performance by this industry into that global industry as a whole. Similarly, in terms of investment, we have assisted in some industries subject to restructuring with strategic assistance with investment, and we will continue to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We come to this debate at an interesting time because there are all sorts of views now about industry policy, about taxation policy and so on. Senator Boswell is one who is advocating another look at tariff policy in the Opposition. The current shadow Minister does not advocate a different view of tariff policy from the one the Opposition has. The honourable member for Chisholm says the Minister is wrong. The Liberal leader in South Australia wants what he calls the `zero tariff lunacy' reviewed. David Jull wants a GST exemption for tourism packages sold overseas. Senator Knowles, as I said, has already announced her policy on the GST.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Could the Minister confirm that, despite all the social justice hand-wringing and professions of concern for the least well off; despite there being record unemployment, 420,000 families without a breadwinner and record general misery, the One Nation statement does precisely nothing for low income earners by way of tax relief or any other form of direct assistance because, as Senator Richardson, pretender to Senator Button's throne, said earlier this year, the Government has already done enough for the poor during the 1980s?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not seen Senator Richardson's comment on this. Various publications of ABS have analysed household disposable incomes in Australia. Over the last few years household disposable incomes of the poorer section of the Australian community have risen significantly because of an element of social wage as well as a wages policy being in place. Both those things have happened.</PARA></TALK.START>

Could the Minister confirm that One Nation indeed proposed very substantial unfunded tax cuts directed at the middle income earners&mdash;the group that Senator Richardson said needed to be courted&mdash;and that it specifically did not propose any reduction in the lowest marginal rate? In other words, despite all the social misery and the extent to which the lower income earners in this country have been devastated over the eight or nine months since One Nation, the Government still proposes to do absolutely nothing for that group by way of tax relief.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Alston ought to have tracked the history of taxation changes in the last few years before asking that question, which is, in a sense, an ignorant question.

One has to look at the level of household disposable income of the families in these groups&mdash;something the Opposition did not do; something it certainly did not do when it siphoned off the bulk of its tax cuts to the mega-rich.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure all Australians shared the Government's distress and concern on learning of the great loss of life, devastation and suffering which has been caused by Saturday's earthquake in Flores in eastern Indonesia. While Indonesian authorities are still assessing the full extent of the disaster, it does appear that the loss of life exceeds 1,300 people.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the question of Australian assistance, on learning of the devastating effects of the earthquake, Australia's Ambassador in Jakarta provided immediately to the Governor of the Province of East Nusa Tenggara an immediate grant of $A15,000 to assist in meeting very urgent food and other needs. The Australian Government's position is that we stand ready to respond quickly to any requests that we receive from the Indonesian Government for emergency assistance and also to contribute to longer term rehabilitation and reconstruction of the damaged region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An officer of our Jakarta embassy has gone to Kupang, West Timor, today to coordinate any requests for Australian assistance. Another officer is seeking to travel to Flores on the first available flight. We are in a position to move immediately to provide an initial plane load of emergency relief supplies valued at approximately $150,000. It should not, of course, be assumed that that will be the limit of any Australian contribution, but it does depend on what we are asked to provide.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I refer to a report in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> that lending for residential investment property has risen by 45 per cent in the past year. I further note the opinion of Mr Phil Roberts of the Real Estate Institute of Australia that this is `a good sign' for the economy. I ask the Minister: firstly, does he accept that increased investment in housing is in fact a bad sign for the economy because it draws funds away from productive investment; and, secondly, in view of the Prime Minister's criticism last Thursday of the failure of the Australian banks to support small- and medium-sized businesses launching new products, what economic levers remain to the Government after its wholesale deregulation and which levers will the Government use to direct investment away from speculation and towards increased productivity?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is certainly true to say that in Australia over many years the housing sector has usually been one of the leaders in investment after a recession. That has always been so&mdash;largely so in the past because of the lopsided structure of the productive economy in Australia and its traditional emphasis on mining and agriculture.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Panizza says, `Where it should be' because he does not know anything else. But there is nothing surprising about that. As far as the housing sector is concerned at the present time, while there have been increased signs of investment, the number of housing starts has not matched those investment intentions. Any activity in the housing sector is beneficial to an Australian economy with a lot of over-capacity in many industrial establishments and so on. So there are some benefits in a housing sector recovery. But if one looked at the economy in a detached way, one could see that it is perhaps not the most desirable form of investment. As Senator Coulter said, investment in productive activity is much more important for this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the Prime Minister's reference to the failure to invest by financial institutions, and particularly banks, in small- and medium-sized businesses in Australia, it is true that that is a huge problem for this country. It is a problem largely dictated by, I think, ignorance, lack of understanding and lack of knowledge in the financial sector particularly about new industries and what I would call technology intensive industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are plenty of means, however, for encouraging investment in those areas, artificial though they may be. In the One Nation statement we established the so-called pooled development funds with a view to helping more high technology companies through a mechanism which would channel funds into investment in those sorts of companies. I cannot come in here and claim that it is working like a charm at this stage&mdash;it is not&mdash;but it has the capacity to do that, and these things take a little time.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The decision that Senator Reynolds refers to is one that emanates from the Budget.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Budget also encouraged the States to follow suit by offering them some $70m to help meet the cost of extending their concessions to the same groups of people. At the Council of Australian Governments in Perth last week the States accepted the Commonwealth's $70m compensation offer. Because of that, they will be extending their concessions in line with the Commonwealth as of 1 April 1993. As a Government we have also agreed to participate in a broader review of the existing systems of concessions with the States and at the States' request.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In answer to Senator Reynolds's question about how many people will benefit, I think 370,000 pensioners and older long term unemployed people with relatively small private incomes will benefit.

Senator Baume will know that the ILO is a United Nations agency.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Transport and Communications. I refer the Minister to the burgeoning Australian telecommunications industry. This sunrise industry, which is one of the smart industries for Australia's future, had a 6.6 per cent growth rate last year. It has a potential export market of $2 billion a year and further potential to employ many thousands of Australians. With the granting of the mobile licence to Optus, and a third licence, Australia will be forced into the European digital system, GSM, for which Australian manufacturers will have to pay over $1,000 per unit to use, making the fully imported made-up unit the only viable option. I ask the Minister: why is the Government adopting a system that will introduce a monopoly for the European manufacturer and force the Australian mobile phone manufacturers into an uncompetitive position, thereby losing an Australian industry of the future, with its jobs and export earnings that Australia so desperately needs?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a briefing from the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Crean, who announced on 6 December that an agreement had been reached with the European Commission to improve access for Australian wines to Europe. The agreement includes the phasing out of the use of European geographical names. Names such as hock and white bordeaux will be phased out in the next few years. It is expected that others, such as champagne and chablis, will be phased out over a much longer period&mdash;possibly well into the next century&mdash;so that producers and consumers have time to adjust to the changes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many Australian wine names in future will be identified with Australian geographical regions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wine industry target for annual exports by the year 2000 is valued at $1 billion, with more than half of these exports going to Europe. Exports of Australian wines for the year 1990-91 were valued at $243m, of which $104m went to Europe. Imports were valued at $46m.</PARA>

The purpose of the grant is to assist their drive for world competitiveness through organisational change, benchmarking, consultation and quality assurance. The changes introduced by these companies will be used as models to assist other companies planning to introduce workplace change.

But, in relation to the question of an oath of allegiance, it must be the case that if we can simply have an oath of allegiance which includes a pledge of loyalty to Australia and its people, which recognises our common sharing of democratic values, and which includes a pledge to respect the rights and liberties of our fellow Australians and to obey the laws of Australia, I think that would be such an expression of loyalty to this country, its democratic values and its people as would then put any expression of allegiance to the Crown in its proper perspective.</PARA>

All senators are very well aware of the great emotion that is involved when people change their allegiance and become citizens of Australia.

The camp was occupied by UN electoral supervisors and military personnel. No casualties are reported. This is the first time that UNTAC personnel have come under direct attack from the KR. According to a UN spokesman, the Khmer Rouge maintains that it will not guarantee safety for UNTAC personnel in areas it claims until the UN abides by Khmer Rouge conditions for the implementation of the peace settlement. Following, as it did, only two days after the release of six military observers detained by the Khmer Rouge for a number of days, this attack represents a further expression of Khmer Rouge policy which directly contravenes its obligations as a signatory to the Paris accords.

Of course, UN resolution No. 792 was recently passed in that knowledge and with that expectation. We have to anticipate low level cease-fire violations and interference by the Khmer Rouge with the peace process continuing.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After Question Time on Thursday, 10 December, I undertook to respond to matters raised by Senator Crane and Senator Bishop relating to unparliamentary language.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Crane referred to my statement on Wednesday, 9 December in which I indicated that I intended to uphold the rule against unparliamentary language, particularly in relation to statements which accuse a senator of lying or of deliberately making statements which a senator knows to be untrue which have always been held to be contrary to standing order 193. Senator Crane indicated that, during an answer to a question by Senator Baume, Senator Button twice used the expression `demonstrably untrue'. I stated that I did not think that Senator Button was referring directly to statements made by a senator, but that I would check the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> transcript.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having looked at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> transcript, I find that Senator Button stated that an allegation made by Senator Baume was `quite wrong&mdash;a demonstrable untruth'. It was this form of words which gave me the impression that Senator Button was not referring directly to statements made by Senator Baume. Senator Button went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Baume tried it again with a second demonstrable untruth.</PARA>
<PARA>Had I distinctly heard this expression, I would have regarded it as unparliamentary, as it does imply that a senator has deliberately made a statement knowing it to be untrue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very difficult, however, to distinctly hear everything said and to make a judgment as to whether it is unparliamentary or contains an offensive imputation while there is a great deal of noise in the chamber as there has been in Question Time, particularly last week. If senators wish to have the rule against unparliamentary language consistently enforced, they should maintain a proper level of decorum in the chamber so that the Chair can hear what is being said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bishop suggested that the statement which I have repeatedly made&mdash;that it is not a matter for the Chair to determine whether statements made by Ministers are accurate or truthful and the rule against accusing a senator of lying&mdash;in some way prevents senators challenging statements which they believe to be untrue. This conclusion does not in any way follow from these principles. If a senator believes that a statement made by another senator is not true, the statement can be rebutted in subsequent debate. This can be done without accusing a senator of lying, that is, deliberately making a statement which the senator knows to be untrue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a senator actually wishes to take the serious step of accusing another senator of deliberately making a statement which the other senator knows to be untrue, that can be done only by way of a substantive motion, for example, a motion of censure or a motion asking the Senate to find a senator guilty of contempt. Such a motion would be subject to the normal procedural limitations relating to notice or leave.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This leads to the second point raised by Senator Bishop, which is the principle referred to at page 1004 of Odgers' <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Senate Practice</EMPHASIS>, that making a deliberately misleading statement may be treated as a contempt of the Senate. It is not, however, for the Chair to determine whether a senator has been guilty of such a contempt. That is a matter that can be determined only by the Senate itself on a substantive motion being moved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out that the precedent for the principle that a deliberately misleading statement is a contempt is the Profumo case, in which the House of Commons declared that Mr Profumo was guilty of a contempt in making statements to the House which he knew not to be true. It is important to note that the only way in which the House was able to establish that Mr Profumo knew that his statements were untrue was that he admitted lying to the House. I suggest that, short of that extreme circumstance, it would be inadvisable for senators to raise allegations of contempt against each other. When they believe that incorrect statements have been made, they should make rebuttals in debate without using offensive language.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also point out that in the course of her remarks Senator Bishop stated that `there are many instances in this place where Ministers and others on the other side of the chamber deliberately tell untruths', and that `members of the Government front bench repeatedly tell fibs'. These remarks were also unparliamentary, but again, due to the noise in the chamber at the time, I was not able to hear them distinctly. During Question Time today, knowing that I was making a statement, I ignored two such interjections, as I have done on some other occasions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is up to all senators to maintain proper standards of language and behaviour in the chamber, and once again I appeal to all senators to do so.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Probably the period just before an election is not a very good time to do it because feelings tend to run a bit high, but after the election we should review the attitudes and the Standing Orders relating to unparliamentary language to see whether we can liberalise that somewhat.

It would go some part of the way if we opened the language up somewhat more so that people in here were freer&mdash;to use Senator Bishop's language&mdash;to use the ordinary language of the street.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was very pleased to hear your explanation, Mr President. I listened very carefully to it and also to what Senator Bishop had to say. Senator Bishop failed to recognise one very important element of what you were saying: the element of intention or purpose behind a remark. Senator Bishop used the example of a member of the Government, say, Senator Evans, saying that black is white. Senator Evans may well believe that black is white. The point at issue is not whether a statement is true or false but whether the person who is making the statement believes one thing and says something different. Mr President, as I understand your explanation, that is the definition that you are giving to the term `lie'. It seems to me that it is not appropriate for members in this chamber to accuse other people of something which reflects adversely on their integrity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may well be&mdash;I will use the example of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Order in the House</EMPHASIS>&mdash;that Senator Macdonald, who was on the program the week before, really does believe, as he asserted on that program, that the Australian Democrats give their preferences to Labor. Again, that particular program did not pick up my correction and left the viewers of that program with a view that that may be the truth. He may believe that to be the truth, and it would be inappropriate therefore&mdash;unless I can somehow get inside his head to establish that he believes that to be false&mdash;to accuse him of being a liar.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, you made a not dissimilar statement a few days ago and I did not respond to that, so I will refer to both statements. I do not dispute what you say, but my concern is that there has been a change in this place in that in recent times Ministers have used Question Time to make statements about Opposition policy which one can only presume they know to be untrue. The statements go far beyond any debatable point and Ministers clearly could not hold that interpretation if they read the document. If it happened once or twice, perhaps one could put that down to carelessness, recklessness or whatever. But in recent weeks it has been happening continually. We can only, therefore, assume that it is a deliberate political tactic to take up the opportunity in Question Time, when we do not have an opportunity to respond in debate, as you mentioned, Mr President, to make statements about Opposition policy&mdash;which Ministers should not be making at all under the rules of Question Time, but that is another matter&mdash;which can only be said to be untrue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How is the Opposition to respond to a tactical move such as that? Unfortunately, Mr President, from your statement there is no satisfactory answer in political terms. Personal explanations are made after the television broadcasting finishes. We cannot respond by debate during Question Time. We cannot interject and say, `That is not the truth; you're telling a lie' because that is unparliamentary. Therefore, if Ministers are going to abuse the process&mdash;which is what I put to you, Mr President, is occurring during Question Time&mdash;the Opposition is being put in an impossible situation. That is an issue which needs to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think it is crossing the line that you put in your interpretation of the rules in relation to unparliamentary comments, but it does mean that there is a major deficiency somewhere in the system.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to add briefly to the remarks made by Senator Newman and Senator Hill. Clearly, with the advent of television, Question Time has attracted more interest and has become a forum in which governments and oppositions make various tactical moves to get their message out to the wider public. It is quite an effective way to do that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the problem, which Senator Hill alluded to, is that quite contrary to Standing Orders, the Government believes that Question Time should be a time in which it can outline particular objections it may have to Opposition policy. Part of the problem that I think you have, Mr President&mdash;I do not believe this has been your intention, but nonetheless this has been the effect of your rulings&mdash;is that the guidelines on Question Time and President's rulings have in some way given some sanction to Government Ministers attacking the policies of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has always been out of order for a Minister to deal with matters outside his portfolio and outside his direct responsibility in response to an answer. If Senator Ray were in the chamber he would undoubtedly stand up and say, `This happened when you were in government'. My response is twofold: it happened from time to time; nonetheless, it was clear that when that occurred it was outside the Standing Orders of the time and if a point of order was taken, it should have been ruled out of order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the advent of TV and with the fact that the Government is determined to use Question Time as a launching pad to effectively attack the Opposition, rather than as a time to account for its own actions and the responsibilities that it has, it has placed you, Mr President, in a very difficult position. It is impossible for us to sit here when Question Time is on national TV and Ministers are constantly and deliberately misrepresenting our policies. The way to deal with this, at least in relation to Question Time, is to go back to the traditional rulings of Presidents&mdash;rulings which have existed since Federation&mdash;that Ministers have to answer questions relating to their responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, I ask you to rethink the ruling you gave which, in a sense, codified and to a certain degree made it permissible for a Minister, provided the question was constructed in a certain way, to attack and debate the policies of the Opposition.

In terms of the ruling which you gave, I think, last Wednesday, or the middle of last week, and in view of what you have said today, will you be calling Senator Button back to this chamber, particularly as he is the Leader of the Government in the Senate?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of two answers given by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button), in response to questions without notice asked by Senators Hill and Alston this day, relating to unemployment and the taxation of low income earners.</PARA>
<PARA>I will be but brief&mdash;and I have only five minutes anyway. It is important to demonstrate that despite all the rhetoric to the contrary, the claim of social justice that the Keating Labor Government so often makes, when it relates to the poor and the unemployed, is simply not substantiated by the facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I start by referring to a document of the Uniting Church issued last month. Honourable senators will remember that in Question Time the Government attacked the coalition in relation to that document. The Government said that the Uniting Church was critical of certain aspects of the coalition's GST policy as it related to a tax on food and that in the view of the church the coalition would discriminate against low income earners. What the Government did not say, however, was that the document said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under ten years of Labor Government we have experienced an enormous widening of the gap between the rich and the poor, and between the high and low income earners in Australia; and the policies have led to, or at least not succeeding in preventing, massive unemployment and a depressed economy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What the church did was to call upon both major parties to review their policies. There is one side of politics in Australia that has listened to the churches and at least said that it would look at its policies. Notwithstanding that there is full compensation for the GST on food for pensioners&mdash;over-compensation actually&mdash;the coalition has nevertheless said that it would look at these policies again and review them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is the Government prepared to review its policies that have resulted in such tragedy for so many of the unemployed and low income earners in Australia? The answer, of course, is no. Here we have a situation where, as a result of Government policies, practically one million Australians are out of work. That is the highest level of unemployment in this country since the Great Depression. Will the Government look at its policies that have resulted in that tragedy? The answer is no. Every day we ask Senator Button: `Will the Government examine the deficiencies in its program and look to apply policies that can give hope to these Australians who are suffering so much?'&mdash;and his answer is no. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at taxation scales for low income earners in Australia, we find that under the Government's One Nation statement the tax for low income earners will not be reduced. Alternatively, if we look at the coalition's policy, tax for low income earners will be reduced. Of course, the Government thought that it could get away with not touching its tax on low income earners because of the issue of the GST. So here we find a situation of the Government standing out there with taxation policies which relatively discriminate against low income earners whilst at the same time having the gall to claim that it is the party of social justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That position simply will not stand analysis. The unemployed will not have any chance of getting a job again in this country until growth rates improve. In other words, we need economic policies that work. Yet, in the last few months Mr Keating has continued saying that growth of 4 per cent&mdash;that is, growth which is needed to create employment&mdash;is achievable. In fact, growth in this country is about 2 per cent. Over the weekend Senator Richardson, the king-maker, went on television and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well anyone who made a prediction of four per cent growth in the immediate future would I think be joking.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further major corrections to incorrect company returns by Prime Minister Keating's half-owned piggery group have been released by the Australian Securities Commission, Liberal front bencher, Senator Michael Baume said today.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Baume said the corrections were unaudited and not signed by the directors, in continuing breach of ASC requirements, but he had been assured by the ASC that audited and signed returns were due to be filed by the group on Friday 18 December.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The ASC has informed me it has required the Prime Minister's Euphron-Brown and Hatton group of companies to file corrected annual returns as part of its inquiries into the group following evidence in the Senate of widespread breaches by the group of Corporations Law and ASC reporting requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Corrections filed by the group and released at the weekend for the Olympia Refrigeration (Sales) Pty Ltd subsidiary show that the annual return for the Year to June 1990, filed belatedly on May 29 1992, overstated the financial strength of the group by $802,410.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(Mr Keating became a half owner of the group on May 15 1991, but is not a director of any group companies).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The return, which is still unaudited and not signed by directors in breach of ASC requirements, reveals that instead of having a shareholders equity, as claimed in its original return of $167,582, the company had a negative shareholders equity of $634,828 after suffering an operating loss for the year of $634,830.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the intangible asset of $308,706 in goodwill is deducted, the total liabilities of the company exceeded its tangible assets by $943,534, double the net tangible assets deficit of $476,289 indicated in the uncorrected return.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Detailed unaudited, unsigned accounts for the Year to June 1991, also released by the ASC, show the company suffered a further loss of $343,548 after slashing its sales revenue by more than one third from $6.9 million to $4.5 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"This further worsened stated shareholders' equity to a negative $978,376 and meant that the company's total liabilities exceeded its tangible assets at June 30 last year by $1,287,082.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"These unsigned, unaudited corrections follow last week's similar corrected return for the Brown and Hatton Group Pty Ltd, which revealed a re-valuation of assets and re-classification of liabilities that had converted Mr Keating's $430,100 investment on May 15 1991, into $4.2 million of shareholders equity within six weeks.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The corrected reports are now being released by the Australian Securities Commission.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have acknowledged continually that Mr Keating is only a half owner and is not a director. He has his nominees on the boards of these companies. But I think I should point out today that, apart from the points made in that press release I put out yesterday referring to incorrect returns by Olympia Refrigeration (Sales) Pty Ltd&mdash;where I said it had to make a correction because of its overstating the worth of the company by $802,400&mdash;further returns have been released today. They show, for example, that the corrected consolidated accounts of Brown and Hatton&mdash;still unsigned and still unaudited, of course&mdash;which were filed on 26 November 1992, show goodwill of $4.76m. They then converted an offsetting loan of $4.45m into a phoney shareholders equity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> However, the subsequent corrected&mdash;still unaudited and unsigned&mdash;accounts for each company making up that group, the last of which I received this morning, do not show any such goodwill or any offsetting debt.

<PARA>Apart from the fact that Senator Tate was born at Crown Street Hospital, I am sure there was no connection with his other answer in relation to the Crown. The Government obviously fails to understand about caesarean section rates, and I want to put this on the record. Private caesarean section rates have always been higher than public caesarean section rates because there are two distinct groups of patients who attend for obstetrics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Private obstetric sector patients are, in general terms, older when they deliver the first child. They have a far higher median age for the first delivery. There are fewer low risk, multiparous pregnancies in the private sector&mdash;they tend to be among public patients. Higher educational levels with more questioning attitudes put greater pressure on the obstetrician to achieve perfect outcomes in the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The peri-natal mortality rate has halved between 1972 and 1992. Currently, approximately 13 babies per thousand die between 20 weeks of pregnancy and six weeks of delivery. Obstetricians have contributed significantly to this decrease in the death rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The implication that somehow or other this is related to insurance is completely untrue because in 1986 the Labor Government unilaterally introduced a global fee for obstetrics whereby the obstetrician received a set rebate no matter what the mode of delivery was. For six years there has been absolutely no financial incentive for any private obstetrician to perform a caesarean section. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The private caesarean section rate has risen each year since 1986, despite the lack of financial incentive. The most important reason for this rise is the medico-legal threat of litigation&mdash;everybody wants a perfect baby. In the private sector, all medico-legal responsibility rests with the individual obstetrician. In the public sector it is devolved between hospitals, midwifery staff, junior medical staff and the senior consultant. In the last six years, medico-legal pressure has been the single largest contributing factor to the rise in private caesarean section rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The presence of health insurance is merely acting as a marker for a totally different group of patients. The private obstetric sector patient is very different from one treated in the public sector, as I have mentioned in my previous comments. So I think it is time that Senator Crowley stopped this doctor bashing&mdash;I am pleased that Senator Tate did not go to that extent. Senator Crowley sees some sort of figure and says, `Ergo, it is related to insurance rates'. I think I have adequately demonstrated that it has no association and could not have any association. I think this matter should now rest where it quite rightfully belongs in terms of the clinical outcomes for the baby and the mother. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would point out that the ASIO Act 1979 (the Act) already makes provision for ASIO Annual Reports to be presented to the Parliament. However, the Act gives the Attorney-General the authority to make such deletions as he considers necessary (after obtaining advice from the Director-General of Security) in order to avoid prejudice to Australia's security, defence, foreign relations, or the privacy of individuals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Act also states that the JSC is not to consider matters that are operationally sensitive (including those relating to intelligence collection methods or sources of information), matters that relate to the obtaining or communicating by ASIO of foreign intelligence, or aspects of ASIO activities that do not affect any person who is an Australian citizen or permanent resident.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the ASIO Annual Report does contain such sensitive information, it would clearly be inappropriate for the entire Report to be presented to the JSC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is not to say, however, that ASIO's annual reports should not be referred to the JSC once tabled in the Parliament after appropriate deletions in accordance with section 94(4) of the Act. It should also be noted that the JSC on ASIO does, in fact, scrutinise those aspects of ASIO annual reports that are relevant to its inquiries under the Act.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet again the Auditor-General has done an excellent job in drawing attention to what is potentially a very serious matter. The Department of Administrative Services contains many of the commercial operations of government. These are operations that really are peripheral to the core of government, but they represent the provision of goods and services to the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some years ago, this was done automatically in that any work required by the public sector was carried out by these arms of government. However, in the past four to five years there have been changes, mainly instigated by the Department of Finance, to commercialise those operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That means that they have been put on some sort of competitive footing. In other words, the Department has introduced, with the support of the Opposition, accrual accounting procedures&mdash;balance sheets, profit and loss accounts, notes to accounts and so on. This action was taken in an attempt to make these business enterprises more competitive. There has also been an untying of the clients. In other words, under the financial management improvement program, other public sector departments have been entitled to go out and seek quotations from the private sector in order to get services provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has introduced an element of competition to the public sector, although not entirely. That element of competition has caused a lot of pain within the private sector because the public sector does have&mdash;even though it might like to argue otherwise&mdash;a lot of benefits compared with the private sector. For instance, the public sector does not pay sales tax on anything; it does not pay the fuel excise levy; and it does not pay the normal State charges that would occur when it operates within the State. Be that as it may, the commercial operations carried out by the Department of Administrative Services include things such as building construction, building maintenance, removals, transportation, printing, purchasing, valuations, renting and fitout of buildings. A fairly large part of the operations is associated with large volumes of money. More importantly, it is big slabs of Government money and therefore taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Audit Office has pointed out that, in 1991, the Department of Administrative Services was responsible for expenditure in excess of $3 billion in taxpayers' money. The Department, quoting from private sector consultants, indicated that fraud in an organisation like DAS could well be in the region of 2 per cent to 5 per cent of turnover. In the case of the Department, this suggests a loss from fraud of somewhere between $60m to $300m a year for the year 1990-91. If those losses do occur, they are in the same league as the losses of failed entrepreneurs who quite properly took a beating in the late 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is worse is that the Audit Office has found that no-one knows for sure whether there has been fraud of $60m or $300m. It is the sort of lackadaisical approach we have come to expect from this Government and from the Minister for Administrative Services, Senator Bolkus, who was responsible for this. When I say that no-one knows for sure, the Auditor-General does point out that the figures should be treated with caution in the absence of a more solid base for estimates and that they should be used for planning purposes. That is quite correct. But it is of great concern that no-one knows. We are talking about taxpayers' money. Although one can say nothing of any praise about those paper entrepreneurs, at least they were not using taxpayers' money; whereas in this instance taxpayers' money was used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1989 the fraud control unit was set up in response to the intention of the Minister&mdash;I am not sure whether it was Senator Bolkus at that time; it probably was not&mdash;that the Department would have a small investigation unit which:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">would . . . take a far more pro-active role in detecting, investigating and obtaining evidence of fraud. It would also actively encourage the expeditious processing of allegations by the AFP and the regular reporting of progress to me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Audit Office general findings are that the fraud control plan introduced by DAS covered only programs which the related risk assessment had identified as highly attractive to fraud. So it was limited. One has to ask the question whether this was really a genuine attempt to tackle fraud or whether it was just a show pony. From the rest of the Auditor-General's report one would have to come to the conclusion that a lot of it was for show, like so much of the stuff we have propounded to us by the Minister, Senator Bolkus, and all the other programs which really have not achieved a lot, but which have been good for show and public display. I can give other examples of this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The comment made by the Auditor-General was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The independence of a fraud control unit in its investigation role must not only be real, but must be seen to be real.</PARA>
<PARA>That is absolutely vital. The Auditor-General continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For that reason it is considered that fraud control activities in a department must not be, and must not be seen to be, controlled by management other than those specifically designated to be responsible for the control of fraud.</PARA>
<PARA>It is a ludicrous situation to be investigating fraud and then having people who are actually responsible for a particular department having some involvement in that investigation. The Auditor-General goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The officer in charge of fraud control should have the clear authority of the Secretary. . . to conduct investigations and refer matters for police investigation or for prosecution as considered appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA>The general findings go on in a way that indicates that this is very sloppy indeed. It is indicative of what is wrong with the Australian economy, because the Government is preoccupied with the political process and not really particularly interested in the management process. That is reflected in the fact that we now have one million people out of work. Over the weekend I heard people from within the business sector predicting that if this Government is allowed to continue next year, there will be about 1 1/2 million people out of work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I raise this matter is that it is clearly a management issue. The fact that we have the worst recession in 60 years is clearly mismanagement by a government which really does not care. All it thinks it can do is solve the problems by playing politics&mdash;and very shallow politics. The Auditor-General says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DAS records were such that in a number of instances DAS had to rely upon the availability and the memories of individuals within DAS management as the basis for management and accountability.</PARA>
<PARA>Madam Acting Deputy President, have you ever heard anything more absurd? I could not help but note the comments made the other day by the Auditor-General on DAS itself and its accrual accounting procedures that if this had occurred in the private sector and this was a public company, the Stock Exchange would not continue to list those shares until it was sorted out. That is the sort of irresponsibility we have. If an efficiency audit of this sort had come out in the private sector, the shareholders would be asking questions and there is a good chance that the whole board of management would have to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The response of DAS to the Auditor-General refers to the time in 1987 when the Department was created and the problems that it has experienced. It goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This process impacts very directly on the nature and extent of the Department's exposure to the risk of fraud; on the structure of the Department and the implications this has had for planning process; and on the development of an appropriate management response to fraud.</PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators should listen very carefully to the response from the Department to the findings of the Auditor-General, which was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department recognises the extent of its exposure to potential fraud and is determined to remain vigilant in its response to that risk and to develop and change its fraud prevention capability in response to the changing nature of the situation in which it finds itself.</PARA>
<PARA>I have heard that so many times on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yes, Minister</EMPHASIS>. This is typical <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yes, Minister</EMPHASIS> stuff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I made earlier was in relation to the level of fraud. The Auditor-General raised the question of the level of fraud. This is a reflection not on the Auditor-General but on the maladministration of a very important department in the Commonwealth which looks after all commercial operations. It is a reflection on this Government's mismanagement of this economy. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not possible to quantify accurately the level of fraud perpetrated against DAS, or any other organisation. The primary difficulty, of course, is the problem of estimating the level of fraud which is not detected. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the purpose of the Fraud Control Unit: to go in there and find the fraud in an area which is most likely to have fraud. The reason for the Fraud Control Unit is the volume of dollars involved. For example, the Department has responsibility for government purchasing. Purchasing in any sector of the economy is always an area where one has to be vigilant at all times because it is open to corruption. It is open to vendors to give bribes to people who are buying things for somebody else. I am not making this statement to reflect on the Department; it is a general comment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Department is involved in the renting and fitting out of buildings. When there is an incredible recession&mdash;a recession we had to have and the greatest recession since the Depression 60 years ago&mdash;there is a temptation for slings to be offered and for under-the-counter moneys to be passed. The area of transportation is a very competitive one in a recessed economy, as is the area of removals. This is where goods are moved from place to place with the movement of defence staff, public servants and so on. Of course, there is also the highly competitive area of building construction and building maintenance. What concerned me more than anything was this. The Audit Office pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When faced with the prospect of an investigation under the disciplinary provisions of the Public Service Act in relation to a matter in the nature of fraud, some DAS staff have elected to resign. Such resignations preclude finalisation of the disciplinary process.</PARA>
<PARA>What an extraordinary situation. If people are caught with their hands in the till pinching money from the taxpayer, they just resign and that is the end of it. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANAO is concerned that such circumstances should not and should not appear to leave departmental staff who may have engaged in inappropriate activity in a preferred position relative to others in the community who are in a similar position.</PARA>
<PARA>From a taxpayer point of view this is absolutely intolerable. The report further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DAS records indicated that in a number of cases staff left the Department when they were confronted with the prospect of disciplinary proceedings. From an administrative viewpoint this can be an efficient means of the organisation being rid of the management problem posed by the staff.</PARA>
<PARA>What a way out. That is most negligent. Again, I am not reflecting upon the Auditor-General: he is the one who picked up all of this. If someone in the Department is caught&mdash;which can be an embarrassment to any supervisor&mdash;they are taken quietly aside and told, `If you leave, nothing will happen to you. There will be no public report made; we will not have any skin off our nose. So just disappear and everything will be all right'. And that is what they have done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Really, a loophole exists which enables a person who has defrauded the Commonwealth, and thus the taxpayer, to get off tax free. I found the Department's response curious and quaint. The Department said that it had considerable difficulty with the reasoning and conclusions in this section that relate to resignation. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DAS procedures are totally in accord with Service wide practices and procedures as set out in the Personnel Manual and Chapter 13 of the Discipline Handbook.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DAS notes&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and if this is the case, the situation is much more serious and extensive&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that public servants&mdash;whether in DAS or elsewhere&mdash;are in no different situation to their private sector counterparts in that</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. their liability to employer disciplinary arrangements cease with their resignation; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. the handling of criminal matters is, and should be, completely independent of employer disciplinary processes.</PARA>
<PARA>I agree with the latter but the report does not say what happens. Bear in mind what I said earlier: the losses from fraud in this Department alone are estimated to be of the order of $60m to $300m a year. It seems to me that the case is closed. There seems to be no reference at all as to where the case goes from there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The comment that `this is no different to the private sector', is quite untrue. If anyone in the private sector is tracked down and picked up for committing fraud in respect of a company's assets, the matter is immediately put in the hands of the police. Irrespective of whether that person left or stayed, if he is found to have done something illegal he would be charged and, if found guilty, convicted. If that has happened, it has been kept very quiet. I do not think anyone in this chamber has ever heard of that sort of thing happening. Yet, the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DAS records indicate that, from the formation of the Fraud Control Unit (FCU) in late 1989 until the end of 1991, 96 cases of possible fraud were referred to that unit. No value was recorded for many of the cases and the FCU advised that it could not estimate the value of cases handled.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a disgrace. It is an absolute disgrace that there has to be a Fraud Control Unit. As I said earlier, this body gives all the impressions of being a showpiece and nothing else&mdash;there is no depth to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To its credit, the Department has said that it will take up something like 12 or 13 of the Auditor-General's recommendations. But why is a report from the Auditor-General needed before anything is done in an organisation? This is typical of this Government. I believe that it is an intolerable situation. It is something that the taxpayers of this country should be appalled about. It is an absolute disgrace, not only for this Government but also for the Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a few comments about the Auditor-General's report No. 11 of 1992-93 into the Department of Administrative Services. As Senator Parer said, this report has revealed a situation that is an absolute disgrace for this Government. But it is not the only area of fraud this Government has chosen to overlook.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Parer stated, there is no formal statement of the role and function which, in practice, the Fraud Control Unit in the Department of Administrative Services has been performing. In the middle of 1992, the Department was, in a formal sense, still relying on the description of the Fraud Control Unit which was set down in May 1989. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taxpayers' money can vanish with absolutely no controls whatsoever in place. This just goes on and on. Last week I asked the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) a question concerning the Department of Administrative Services. That question related to the misuse of parliamentary offices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I have provided the information to the Minister, Senator Bolkus, about the use of Mr Ron Edwards's parliamentary office by a private individual running his own business out of that office. Clearly, the Minister was not going to do anything about that until I provided him with the detail. There were two or three days gap when the Minister could have come back and said, `I have made an investigation', but he did not choose to do so. He has not answered my question following Question Time today, so another day has gone by. Yet we have the misuse of parliamentary offices continuing in such a way that people can use the resources in those offices without any check. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that I made last week, and I will make it again today, is: how can we have someone such as Mr Edwards, who is the Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives and therefore meant to be the keeper of parliamentary standards within the House of Representatives, the second most senior person in charge of the keeping of parliamentary standards, quite clearly flouting his parliamentary entitlements and not being accountable? His answer to a lot of the journalists about that little piece of information has been, `This man, Mr Clohessy, works on a part time basis out of my office'. I am not querying that. That has absolutely nothing to do with the serious questions I raised last week about the misuse of parliamentary offices, which comes under the Department of Administrative Services. The questions I asked last week remain unanswered. They were: how can a private individual, running a private union advocacy business, be using a parliamentary office as a point of contact, and be using the fax machines and the telephones out of that office&mdash;to say nothing of what else, of which I am aware, but one need not have a particularly vivid imagination to think what&mdash;and yet we still cannot get an answer out of the Minister?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today we have the Auditor-General's report coming out and saying that there has been no check on fraud in recent years. Yet we can have the Minister just let that go through to the keeper as well. As a nation we cannot afford to constantly have taxpayers' money going walkabout and have this Government do absolutely nothing about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some months ago I asked for a report on medical fraud to be released because there was a clear problem that the Government had chosen to do nothing about it. The Government chose not to release that report. In the end it became an order of the Senate that the Minister had to release that departmental report on medical fraud. We had a situation then similar to that which we experienced last week, where an order of the Senate was made that the document on the goods and services tax in New Zealand be released. On both occasions, in relation to the medical fraud document and the goods and services tax document last week, both Ministers in effect said to the Senate, `Get lost. We are not going to release those reports', even though they had been ordered to do so. The weak, limp excuse that they used about Medicare fraud was that it might teach someone how to commit Medicare fraud. Fortunately the time expired last Friday for that document to be issued ultimately on a confidential basis and the Government said that there would be an Auditor-General's report put down on that issue last week as well. We still have not seen that report. Yet today we have an Auditor-General's report on the question of fraud in the Department of Administrative Services which is absolutely and utterly damning. Presumably this year, next year, some time, never, we will get an Auditor-General's report on Medicare fraud&mdash;when the Government chooses to release it; it has got nothing to do with the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1982 it was suggested that Medicare fraud amounted to about $100m. By 1984 it was suggested that it was about $200m. Since then, this Government has continually trumpeted the benefits and the wonders of bulkbilling, yet it has done absolutely nothing about stopping the level of Medicare fraud. All it does is go around and doctor bash, pharmacist bash and pathologist bash. Yet where is that report? Here we have the Auditor-General's report on the Department of Administrative Services, which is absolutely damning of this Government's inactivity and carelessness with taxpayers' money. How can the Government sit in this place and say that the loss of millions upon millions of taxpayers' money matters not, whether it is the Department of Administrative Services or the Health Insurance Commission that has chosen not to exercise any control whatsoever over fraud?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would be interested to find out whether the Minister will ever answer the questions about the misuse of Mr Edwards's office. The evidence in itself is damning. The testimony given by so many employers who have been contacted by Mr Clohessy is that they have been pressured to extreme lengths to re-employ people who have been dismissed, even though he is not a judge of whether the dismissal has been fair or otherwise. On all occasions of which I have been given examples, he has used Mr Edwards's office as the contact point. He has followed up with all the supplementary information to the Chamber of Commerce in Western Australia, the Industrial Relations Commission in Western Australia and other parties utilising Mr Edwards's fax machine, telephone and office. If that is not fraud against the Commonwealth under the Department of Administrative Services, what is? Our offices are not supplied to do that. Our offices are purely and simply supplied for the use of parliamentary and electorate work in serving our constituents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I await to see what the Minister will say about the question that I raised. I am not surprised to see the Auditor-General's report today saying that the Government has yet again sat on its hands and treated taxpayers' money with absolute and total disregard. I ceased being amazed with that when I read the Harvey Bates report on Medicare fraud, which I had to struggle to get released a few months ago. Therefore, to see this report today does not amaze me one iota. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I gave Senator Knowles a free go; I could have made all sorts of comments. I am asking her to let me be heard for a few minutes in silence. I wish to make the second point to the press gallery. Time and time again I have seen the AAP, in particular, come in here, take off an allegation that has been made and give it a big run without checking the source, the facts and the reality. I say to members of the AAP this time that it may be to their benefit if they were to pause at the end of what I say and assess the allegations that have been made in the context, not of what has been asserted so far but in terms of some of the points I wish to make in respect of the Auditor-General's report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to those in the press gallery that, if they are honest and balanced in their journalistic approach to this issue, they will not run off immediately and write histrionic stories about what has been alleged in the Auditor-General's report. Contrary to the assertions that have been made by those opposite, the report goes through the history in one department&mdash;the Department of Administrative Services&mdash;of an attempt to oversee the detection of fraud in that department. A special mechanism was put in place. We did not leave it to the AFP or to toothless committees or whatever. The Fraud Control Unit was set up before I took over the portfolio. It was given responsibility, as is documented in the Auditor-General's report, to investigate fraud within the Department. We felt that, in essence, a department such as this, within the process that was going on there and even at the end of the process, would need a special focus within it to detect practices and instances which would be assessed as a fraud on the taxpayer. As a consequence, my predecessor, Mr Stuart West, set up the Fraud Control Unit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consistently in the last 2 1/2 years since I have had the portfolio, I have made it very clear to the departmental Secretary and to those that have been charge of the Fraud Control Unit that if they ever needed any more resources they would have them. Not only did I make it clear myself, but Mr Tanzer also made that very clear to those running the unit. From day one the staff of the unit have had access to me and the departmental Secretary, and from day one they have been told that resources would not be a limitation; they would be made available to them&mdash;and that has been the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some two months ago, in discussions with Mr Tanzer I suggested that we set up a review of the Fraud Control Unit and that it should be set in place within a short period. The review would be conducted by outside people to look not just at the things that the Auditor-General looked at but also at other practices, and to make comparisons with similar organisations and similar departments within Australia and elsewhere. It was to look at the concept of white collar crime, or an aspect of it, to see whether we could enhance the FCU in the way it needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General's report looks at the history of this organisation and whether in its history, its conception and its practice it conforms to certain standards. I am concerned to do more than that. I am concerned to see whether we have the appropriate unit for a department such as this&mdash;whether we need to have a different sort of unit, a broader one or a more limited one; and, in setting up the appropriate institution, to see what resources it may need. In my approach to this I am not limited by the parameters that the Auditor-General felt necessary when he and his organisation made an assessment of the FCU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me turn to some of the recommendations. I think the most important one mentioned by Senator Parer was an aspect of the report which is geared, I suppose, to invoke the attention of those in the gallery; that is, that something like $60m to $300m is the level of fraud in this Department. Let me read the actual reference in the report of the Auditor-General from which this bald assertion or allegation was supposed to have come. It is worth putting this on the record not just for the Senate but just in case some misguided undergraduate journalist decides to run with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to section 1.4 on page 2 of the report, headed `The level of fraud in the Department of Administrative Services'. I will read all of that section because it is important, it is instructive, it clarifies the situation, and it takes the air of the sort of false assertion that was made early in this debate. It states:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will go on. In fact, I will start again. The report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not possible to quantify accurately the level of fraud perpetrated against DAS, or any other organisation. The primary difficulty, of course, is the problem of estimating the level of fraud which is not detected.</PARA>
<PARA>That is understood as well. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another problem is determining how the value should be measured. For example, whether the amount quoted is to be the amount which the offenders sought to obtain, the amount the offenders received, the amount quoted in an allegation or the amount relating to which a conviction is recorded.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a general statement. It is a general statement about any organisation&mdash;DAS or any organisation. It has no direct relevance to DAS. It is in no way at all telling the world that this is the level of fraud in DAS. It is in no way telling the world what the situation is in DAS. It talks conceptually of any organisation. As honourable senators will see in the next chapter, that organisation could be in the private or public sector. Paragraph 1.4.2 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DAS quoted private sector consultants as indicating that fraud in an organisation was likely to be in the region of 2 per cent to 5 per cent of turnover.</PARA>
<PARA>Private sector consultants were not asked to look at DAS and to make an assessment of what the fraud level was in DAS. They were asked to make an assessment of what one could reasonably expect to be a fraud level in any organisation, private or public&mdash;not just DAS. The point I am making here is that that sentence, damning though it might sound, has to be assessed in the context that what we have is the Department itself asking private consultants what would be a theoretical level of fraud in an organisation, private or public, and they say 2 per cent to 5 per cent. The report then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the case of DAS this suggests a loss to fraud of $60m to $300m for the 1990-91 financial year. Such figures must obviously be treated with extreme caution, however, in the absence of a more solid base for estimates they could be used for planning purposes.</PARA>
<PARA>The point is that the Auditor-General has not found $60m to $300m worth of fraud in this Department. The point is that the Auditor-General himself, or his organisation, did not come up with that figure. It is the planners within DAS, the managers within DAS who, in anticipation of problems, have taken steps and measures and advice as to how to plan for those problems. There is not claimed to be $60m to $300m worth of fraud in this Department. Anyone who comes in here and makes that assertion is wrong, and they know they are wrong. As the Auditor-General says, that is just an estimate that should be used for planning purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are having a theoretical discussion about organisations and the level of fraud within them, private or public. The next paragraph is also very instructive in terms of what is actually happening within DAS and in terms of what has been detected. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DAS records indicate that, from the formation of the Fraud Control Unit (FCU) in late 1989 to the end of 1991, 96 cases of possible fraud were referred to that unit. No value was recorded for many of the cases and the FCU advised that it could not estimate the value of cases handled.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the actual reflection of the level of fraud that has been detected so far. As I have said, I have not been happy with the FCU. My departmental Secretary has acknowledged the need for review, and that is precisely what we are going to do. It is a broader review than has been conducted by the Auditor-General. Let me say that anyone who comes in here and asserts that that is the level of fraud, anyone who writes that, is perpetrating a great fraud on the electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any organisation as big as DAS, which has some 11,000 staff and a budget of $2 billion or $3 billion, has to take measures to respond to, plan for and anticipate any level of fraud. We have done that. What the Auditor-General's report has done is quite valuable. Of the 11 recommendations put forward by the Auditor-General, the Department will pick up and implement 10. We will go further than that and have an overall review of the FCU, which I think is necessary. The Auditor-General's Department, in its press release issued today, has acknowledged that we have responded favourably to 10 of its recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The eleventh recommendation goes to the question that needs to be resolved between the ANAO and the Department. This recommendation, which was not accepted, relates to the fact that the National Audit Office disagrees with the DAS decision to supplement the Public Service Commission guidelines on official conduct with a departmental code of ethics. It is not a matter of reducing them; it is a matter of putting in other guidelines on which ethics can be assessed. The ANAO&mdash;quite rightly, in its mind&mdash;believes that the Public Service Commission code should be amended and extended to cover the circumstances of all departments. DAS believes that a conduct specific code for DAS is beneficial, considering the fact that we are talking of a commercialised and commercialising institution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think I have dealt sufficiently with the Auditor-General's report, so I will speak more on my last point about a commercialised and commercialising institution. We are talking of an institution which over the last five years has gone from being a Public Service department to one which, by the end of this financial year, will have to compete on the open market for some 95 per cent of its work. No longer will other departments be bound by any dictate that they have to go to DAS if they want work done; 95 per cent of our functions will be untied and open to competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over recent years that has meant that DAS has been reduced from a department with some 18,000 staff to one with some 11,200 staff. It has meant savings per annum for the Commonwealth of approximately $200m. All this has been done with hardly a day lost through strike. All this has been done through consultation. We have reached this part of the process, having commercialised, restructured and refitted this organisation into a commercially orientated one, without blood spilt on the floor and with the cooperation of everyone involved. As a direct result of this, the Commonwealth and the taxpayer are paying $200m a year less for services provided by DAS. That is not a bad outcome. If I had had more time, I would have been able to bring in quotations from Estimates committees. Senator Parer, in the darkness of closed, smaller rooms, would acknowledge that the process has been run successfully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One exercise that this Department has been responsible for is Comcar. I had not been satisfied with the way it had been running, and nor should I have been. About 18 months ago I brought in Price Waterhouse to look at Comcar as an organisation and to look at its management structures. It gave us a proposal for the restructure of Comcar. At that stage, it was losing $11m, $12m, $13m, $15m, $20m&mdash;escalating into the future. Price Waterhouse Urwick came to us with a draft management plan and proposals to restructure the organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We actually got in the business consultant from Price Waterhouse Urwick to take over the organisation of Comcar, to run it for some time. I think Rob Pocknee did a great job&mdash;and that has been acknowledged in Estimates committees as well&mdash;to the extent that at the end of this financial year the savings that will have been achieved in Comcar will be greater than those projected to be achieved by Dr Hewson and his `Knockback' package. By the end of this financial year, we will have achieved $11 1/2m or so in savings. Dr Hewson anticipated saving $10m by cutting the guts out of the organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That has been a remarkable transformation, one which Senator Parer has acknowledged in the Estimates Committee. If honourable senators opposite want to come in here and invoke some professional competence, they should not do so until they have done their homework. That is what happened this afternoon. We have had a proposal from the Opposition that has been running for 54 weeks&mdash;the Fightback package. To show how widely off the mark the Opposition is today, in looking at Administrative Services, the Opposition is $500m out over a three-year period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition can say `wrong'. It can abuse the critics. We have achieved the savings; we have documented those savings; we have budgeted for them. How are we wrong when honourable senators on the other side claim a $20m saving out of a part of a budget of only $3m? We are not wrong. The Opposition has it totally wrong. This week in particular it is appropriate to say something about Australia's media&mdash;they have got it wrong. The trouble with Australia's media is that they report politics the way they report one-day cricket games. At the end of the day they go to bed and they think the scores are up on the board and either Hewson has won or Keating has won. The reality of politics in any country is that it lasts more than one day per game. This is a long test match. They will go away this week and say that Dr Hewson has discovered a new spirit of concern and humanity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The punters out there think quite differently. The cynicism about the Opposition is reminiscent of swimming in a quagmire, in a swamp. They can see it out there; the gallery upstairs does not see it. It is about time that gallery looked at the figures that came out last year and looked at the assertion that we make that the Opposition is $500m wrong in its Fightback assessment. The gallery should not cop the response that it is wrong and that it is rubbish without that assertion being documented and substantiated. Not once have the members of the gallery taken to task one of the Opposition front benchers and said, `Your figures might be wrong'. The starting point for this week ought not to be a glassy eyed view of the Fightback package. They ought to do their homework before Friday, and they ought to do it here&mdash;because there is $500m for a start and then another $800m at least because the Opposition has not factored in the costs of redundancies and superannuation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) attacked the media for not reporting the running of the Department of Administrative Services in the way that he would like it to be reported. I take note of the fact that, in the computer and communications section  of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> this morning, there was a reasonably critical article of DAS apropos the computer system that is to be installed in Comcars. I think we were told in Estimates hearings that this system would cost about $4m. I have now heard that it will cost approximately $7m. It was designed to be similar to the F-F-fast Trax system, which was developed by a Sydney-based company.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department found that the particular system it had been using&mdash;the IBM RISC system&mdash;was not suitable and it had to be amended. After 15 months or so, the Department got the system working very well. The Government obviously looked at this system&mdash;as did Air New Zealand and the Federal Airports Corporation&mdash;yet the Minister's Department turned around and went ahead with a system that had been found to be faulty. As this article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now any problem can be solved if you are willing to stand back and throw money and resources at it, and this is what DAS has done.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the sort of thing that the Auditor-General is raising: the waste of money by this Department. The Minister stood up here today and said that his Department had saved $200m. Well done, congratulations! But that does not mean that other systems cannot be looked at. Here we see the same sorts of mistakes being made again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Zakharov, a few other senators and I were victims of that system in South Australia in the first week it operated. None of us received cars, but we accepted the fact that a new system has teething problems. When one reads this article it seems that the system it was based on had teething problems and that the Department took no notice of those problems and went ahead and put in exactly the same system, with the same sorts of problems. It seems that the Australian Audit Office has announced that it is going to use the same system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think some of these people should start looking again at the whole system of computer purchasing. Not long ago I raised the matter of some $270,000 being spent on bringing computer experts from the UK to advise on the purchase of a computer system for the Attorney-General's Department. That project has still not got off the ground. I believe the Canadian-based software in the computer system called LOIS, which was put in place for the Attorney-General's Office, has been found unsuitable and millions of dollars have been wasted. It seems that the Government's whole program of computerising everything has broken down just as the Government has. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to speak on the Auditor-General's report on the procedures for dealing with fraud on the Commonwealth, I will pick up on an issue that the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) tried to make capital out of a few minutes ago. Mr Acting Deputy President, you, no doubt rightly, asked me to withdraw my claim that the Minister was a fraud. I suppose fraud was on my mind. I am concerned, however, that the Minister has, in a quite disgraceful way, tried to draw a parallel between the employment, of which I know nothing, I might add, of somebody in Dr Hewson's office who is not paid by the Commonwealth but apparently paid by the Liberal Party and somebody working in Mr Ron Edwards's office who is running a business and using Commonwealth provided facilities to run that business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember full well that when Senator Knowles last week asked a question of the Minister about the use of Mr Edwards's office, the Minister said he would undertake to investigate the matter. He clearly did not investigate it. He is now suggesting that he was totally dependent upon Senator Knowles providing him with information before he would investigate the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That seems to be a pretty inadequate response from a Minister whose Department has already had to answer to the Auditor-General on its failure in dealing with fraud against the Department. It is an indication that the question of fraud against the Commonwealth is not exactly a burning issue with either the Department or, particularly as we see in this case, the Minister. I find that totally unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is wrong for the Minister to then try to suggest that Dr Hewson, as the Leader of the Opposition, has somebody working in his office whose salary is paid by the Liberal Party. If it is true, it is an unsatisfactory comparison. There is nothing dishonest, illegal or improper about that at all. If Senator Knowles or I wanted to have somebody on our staff that we paid for out of our pockets, is the Minister suggesting that that would also be improper in some way and comparable with the alleged misuse of Mr Edwards's office?</PARA>

In almost any dealing I have had with the Minister over the last two or three years, I have found that the Department seems to run on and the Minister does not seem to know much about what is going on in his Department. So perhaps he will try to suggest to us that any attempt to chase up fraud in his Department is something which he knows not much about. Certainly from what he said in his speech this afternoon he is not very enthusiastic about proceeding with chasing fraud. He seemed to spend most of his time defending his position and, as I say, making a disgraceful comparison between somebody in Dr Hewson's office and the allegations of Senator Knowles about the use made of the office of Mr Ron Edwards. For that reason, I felt obliged to add my six penn'orth to this debate. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the fourth report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Super&mdash;Fiscal and Social Links</EMPHASIS>. As the title suggests, our report looks at two of the most important links with retirement incomes policy: how taxation affects it and how it meshes with social security.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 12 and 15 November 1992 the Senate referred to the Committee the provisions and then the actual contents of Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Bill 1992 and Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3) 1992, Divisions 16&mdash;19 (inclusive). Pursuant to that referral, the Committee received an additional 36 written submissions and held a public hearing on Thursday, 26 November 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In tandem with the Bills referred, the Committee tackles in this Report the terms of reference dealing with taxation, social security and vesting and preservation of benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Honourable Senators may care to note that, as part of its ongoing inquiry, the Committee has received over 300 written submissions and filled over 2500 pages of Hansard with transcripts of its public hearings. The topicality and importance of superannuation, both to the individual and to the economy, have ensured that our labours have attracted considerable attention. Indeed, the Committee has been at the centre of change while simultaneously pursuing its enquiries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The work of the Committee has been well received and has led to fundamental changes in the regulation of superannuation. This is evidenced by the Strengthening Super Security  Statement of the Treasurer. Similarly, the changes announced in the Treasurer's Statement Security in Retirement largely reflected the quality of the evidence that the Committee received.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So at times the Committee has followed Government action and at times it has prompted Government action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee had originally intended to report on the links between superannuation and taxation and social security in early December and the referral of the Bills to us was, thus, timely. However, it also put the Secretariat of the Committee under further pressure. As such, before moving to the substantive aspects of the Report, I would like to express my appreciation of the dedication and skill of the staff of the Committee secretariat. Since its inception, the Committee has had ten staff members at various times. The staff members who have worked on this Report are Mr Richard Gilbert (Secretary), Mr Michael Game, Mr Gary Bauer and Miss Heather Hibbitt. In addition, I wish to acknowledge the dedication of the Senate Print Room and the interest that the Usher of the Black Rod has shown in our work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, I have found that the Committee members have worked well together. We have had over 70 meetings since our inception and the sense of purpose that has surrounded our endeavours has been enthusing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of course, due to the subject matter of the Committee being in the political spotlight, and due to the wide-ranging nature of our inquiry, differences have arisen from time to time. But where such differences have arisen, I found that they were dealt with amicably by members.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I turn now to the reforms introduced by Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Bill 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (SUPERANNUATION) BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Bill 1992 substantially alters the current taxation arrangements applying to superannuation. The modifications it makes largely reflect and, I wish to add, were prompted by, the thorough and detailed evidence that the Committee received in its 300 written submissions and heard in its many days of public hearings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill substantially implements the changes foreshadowed by the Treasurer in his Security in Retirement Statement of 30 June 1992. Significant changes are made to the contributions phase of the superannuation flow. These changes include:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.replacing the confusing deduction and rebate regime for member contributions with a simple rebate. It should be noted that this rebate is intended to complement the Superannuation Guarantee Charge scheme which requires employer contributions for the benefit of nearly all employees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.replacing the complicated limits on employer and self-employed contributions with a simple age-based scale.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These changes have excited the press and the community recently. There have been claims that the changes are unfair. Unfortunately, many commentators seemed to have missed the point that a generous voluntary scheme is not compatible with the Government's compulsory scheme. It was established earlier this year that a compulsory system is preferable to a voluntary system. Many commentators seem to also miss the point that tax expenditures&mdash;like government expenditure&mdash;need to be carefully targeted and that there are competing claims for Government attention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As far as the benefit phase is concerned, the Bill makes important and overdue reforms. Most sweeping of these are the RBL changes. From July 1994, administration of RBLs will be undertaken by the Tax Office. In addition, the inequitable and extremely complicated RBL formula will be replaced by a flat $400,000 lump sum RBL and an $800 000 pension RBL. During the course of our inquiry there was an overwhelming call for a flat dollar RBL.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Important changes are also made to the tax treatment of pensions and roll-over annuities. These include: introducing a new 15 per cent rebate for super pensions and roll-over annuities; amendments to the definitions of undeducted purchase price and unused undeducted purchase price; and extension of the meaning of `pension' and `annuity' to ensure appropriate tax treatment for allocated pensions. As with RBLs, the Committee had heard clear calls from the community for many of these changes. It is hoped that such changes will increase the attractiveness of income-stream products and help wean people off lump sums.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Changes are also made to the rules surrounding the rolling over and taxation treatment of the concessional component of ETPs. These changes largely strengthen the integrity of the superannuation system and make sure conspicuous rorting is curtailed. The message coming from all of our reports is clear: superannuation is a means of securing a retirement income, not a means of amassing tax-free or tax-assisted wealth. Just as the Committee recommended strong controls on fund trustees in its first report, the Committee is keen to see a responsible attitude taken by beneficiaries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments are made to the Income Tax Assessment Act to achieve the above and, where necessary, supplementary amendments are made to the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, amendments are made to the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 to allow certain flat-dollar contributions made by employers to satisfy the requirements of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO 3) 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate referred Divisions 16 to 19 of this Bill to the Committee, all of which deal with proposed changes to the means tests for social security benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Division 16 deals with the treatment of managed investments. The changes will considerably simplify and clarify the rather complex rules in this area and also enable losses to be offset against gains on other managed investments in the same period. The basis of assessment will be the actual performance over the previous 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Division 17 exempts from the means tests money in a qualifying fund until pension age or until an annuity or pension becomes payable. This removes an inequity whereby unemployed people had their benefits reduced on account of their unpreserved benefits in such funds. Some were forced to access these funds for short-term income support rather than preserving them until retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Division 18 extends to listed shares the provisions applying to managed investments. Hitherto, only dividends were brought to account, but these amendments will include the capital growth. As with managed investments, losses incurred in the same period will be offset against gains.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Division 19 deals with allocated pensions, which are a recently developed hybrid investment vehicle with some of the characteristics of annuities and others making them similar in many respects to managed investments. The amendments will remove the uncertainties which have hitherto surrounded these investments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ability of the recipient to vary the income stream and to withdraw the capital sum justifies their inclusion in both the income and assets tests, notwithstanding the strong representations put to us that these investments should enjoy the same privileges as conventional annuities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CONCLUSION</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the work of the Select Committee is not yet complete. We will now turn to an emerging issue for all fund trustees&mdash;the superannuation supervisory levy. In addition, our Report on Fees, Commissions and Disclosures will shortly be handed down. That Report will address the issues raised by the Committee's earlier options paper.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first report which I have just tabled relates to the development of RAAF Base Scherger at Peppan, Cape York Peninsula. The scope of the works, estimated to cost 166.65 million dollars at December 1991 prices, involves the construction of aircraft pavements, flight strips, shelters, as well as operational and technical support, accommodation, engineering and support services. Development of the RAAF Base Scherger will complete the chain of RAAF airfields across Australia's north. In peacetime the primary purpose of the airfield will be for exercises and deployments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recommending that the work should proceed, the Committee has concluded that whilst the scope of the proposed work is extensive, it agrees that in order for the airfield to function as a facility for exercises and deployments, it can be justified on the basis of operational requirements and experience which has been gained from the design, construction and operation of a similar facility at RAAF Base Curtin and the airfield at RAAF Base Tindal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Selection of the site at Peppan, near Weipa, followed an extensive site selection process and the Committee has concluded that the Peppan site offers considerable advantages over the other sites examined. Furthermore, the Committee concluded that the Peppan site would not be incompatible with, and could be complementary to, any future spaceport developments on Cape York.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's inquiry focused on a number of matters and recommendations about them are in the report. They cover such things as the energy efficiency of the facilities and structures to be provided, a bush fire plan, the need for the environmental management plan to continue the process of environmental sensitivity, the haulage of rock from a quarry located 170 kilometres from the construction site, the use of the local workforce at Weipa, the process of consultation during the construction and post construction phases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One significant feature of the construction of RAAF Base Scherger will be the use which will be made of Army engineers on selected works. This will comprise bulk earth works and heavy civil engineering construction. The Committee was advised that Army engineers have undertaken this type of work before but not on a project as large as is proposed. The Committee concluded that the use of Army engineers for construction will result in cost savings as well as providing an ideal opportunity for Army personnel to be involved in a large-scale construction project.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second report relates to the Construction of an Australian Embassy Complex in Suva, Republic of Fiji.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee was advised at the public hearing that the present Chancery is located on two floors of a high-rise building in Suva. It is in a dilapidated state and services such as lifts and airconditioning are run down. The landlord has advised he will not renew the lease on the premises which will expire in November 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In February 1991 the Australian Government purchased a block of land about 3 km from the Central Business District. It is proposed to construct a Chancery, Head of Mission residence, staff accommodation and recreational facilities on this site.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee was advised that although the proposal was referred to the Minister for Finance in January 1992 it was not referred to the Public Works Committee until September 1992. This has resulted in the estimated cost increasing from 7.335 million dollars to 9.368 million dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although agreeing that a need exists in Suva to construct an Australian Embassy Complex, the Committee draws attention to the continuing problems associated with overseas projects. Under present legislation the Public Works Committee is unable to meet outside Australia or its external territories. Until this legislation is amended, to enable site inspections to be carried out overseas, the Committee continues to reluctantly give approval for construction of projects which, in its view, it has been unable to properly assess.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taking into account these reservations, the Committee recommends the Construction of an Australian Embassy Complex in Suva, Republic of Fiji at an estimated cost of 9.368 million dollars at July 1992 prices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The third report relates to the construction of Australian Embassy staff apartments at Attakarn Prasit, Bangkok, Thailand. The Committee was advised that there has been a long-standing problem in Bangkok associated with finding suitable staff accommodation within easy reach of the Chancery.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is proposed to build 51 apartments on a block of land owned by the Australian Government fronting Soi Attakarn Prasit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present eight townhouses occupy the site. These townhouses will be demolished to enable the 51 apartments to be constructed. This will optimise the use of this prime site which is presently underdeveloped. The apartments will be constructed in two blocks of six levels and will be located away from the main road. The site will be surrounded by a perimeter fence and the main gate controlled from a guardpost.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee was advised that there will be an option for an Australian officer to lease an apartment to an officer of another nationality, should the officer decide to live elsewhere. The Committee however, recommends that once an apartment is leased to an officer of another nationality, that lease should be linked to the Australian officer's term of duty and should expire once that officer's posting to Bangkok is terminated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Once again the Committee draws attention to the continuing problems associated with overseas projects. Until legislation is amended to enable site inspections to be carried out overseas, the Committee continues to reluctantly give approval for construction of projects which, in its view, it has been unable to properly assess.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is anticipated that the work will be completed by August 1994. The limit of cost estimate of the proposed works is 16 million dollars at August 1992 prices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends the Construction of Australian Embassy staff apartments at Attakarn Prasit, Bangkok.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fourth report which I have tabled concerns the Stage 1 redevelopment of Lavarack Army Barracks in Townsville. The preliminary estimate for the works is 20.96 million dollars. The Committee has recommended that the work should proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The scope of the works is generally to rectify deficiencies in the working accommodation occupied by a number of disparate elements of No. 3 Brigade, the Ready Deployment Force, which is based at Lavarack encompassing:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">new permanent purpose built accommodation for 162 Reconnaissance Squadron</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">new accommodation for elements of No 3 Brigade Administrative Support Battalion</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a new Lavarack Barracks Medical Centre</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a kerbside refuelling facility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In all instances the existing accommodation which these new facilities will replace are sub-standard and the Committee concluded that there is a need for them to be replaced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's inquiry into this proposal focussed on a number of issues relating to the siting of the new facilities, fire protection measures, energy management and conservation and security. In all instances matters which were addressed by the Committee at the public hearing were addressed satisfactorily by the Department of Defence</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fifth report relates to the Construction of a Storage/Display facility for the Australian War Memorial at Mitchell, ACT.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian War Memorial presently occupies sites at Campbell, Duntroon and Mitchell. The store at Duntroon houses large relics of war including aircraft, tanks, boats and large guns. The store has deteriorated rapidly in recent years. Flooding, vermin, lack of security and poor environmental conditions are increasing the risk of damage and destruction to very important and historically irreplaceable relics. The Duntroon store is totally unsuitable for visitors to view the objects, thus denying public access to a significant part of Australia's national cultural heritage. This storage facility will no longer be available to the War Memorial after the end of 1993, when the Army will reclaim the land for the redevelopment of the Royal Military College Logistics Complex planned for construction in financial year 1994/1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is proposed to construct a building on the corner of Lysaght, Vicars and Callan Streets, Mitchell ACT. The site is already partly occupied by the Memorial's existing relic warehouse, immediately adjacent to where the proposed building will be constructed and is directly opposite the Memorial's Conservation Annex.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Public access within the building will be limited to a mezzanine level. This will ensure visitor safety as well as security for the collection. Special access for groups will be provided by prior arrangement with curatorial staff.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The building is estimated to cost 6.5 million dollars at September 1992 prices. Construction is planned to commence no later that the end of February 1993 with the building taking approximately one year to complete.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Rather than delay the Senate by reading the tabling speech, I would like to comment on two matters. The second report relates to the construction of the Australian Embassy complex in Suva, Republic of Fiji. I am not arguing that this should not happen. In fact, the present complex is rather dilapidated and the lease arrangement has been terminated. I am concerned that the Public Works Committee discovered that this matter was referred to the Minister for Finance and approved in January 1992, but it was not referred to the Public Works Committee until September 1992 and, as a result of that delay, the estimated cost of the project has increased by just over $2m. That is a terrible waste of taxpayers' money.</PARA></TALK.START>

As Chairman of the Waste Watch Committee, I assure the Senate that I will be looking at this. I am pleased to see that Senator Bolkus is in the chamber because the other concern that the Committee has&mdash;as we have said on many occasions&mdash;is that when we have to approve these overseas projects, it is always on the premise that we do not view them. We have site visits to all projects that we approve in Australia, wherever they are, and we are able to understand the situation at first hand. Yet, because of the provisions in the Public Works Committee Act 1969, which have been in place for many years, the Public Works Committee is unable to meet outside of Australia or its external territories. Each and every member of this Committee believes that that hinders our parliamentary process. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats will not be supporting the Opposition's amendment. We have examined it carefully. Part IV of the Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 is directed towards advancing unhindered competition. Certainly, substantial penalties are required for that.

We believe that these actions should be removed from the Trade Practices Act and placed in industrial relations legislation, which also provides for a labour court or for increased powers of the Industrial Relations Commission to deal with breaches of section 45D and section 45E.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government will be opposing the amendments regarding penalties for breaches of sections 45D and 45E that have been moved by the Opposition. Whilst the sections are sometimes presented rhetorically in terms of union provisions, they also cover activities of business firms.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To move to an increase in the penalties for breaches of the sections seems unnecessary because compliance with the sections has been very largely achieved through the use of injunctions to prevent persons from continuing to breach the provisions. Following the granting of an injunction there is usually a period of negotiation and arbitration in the industrial relations area. Given the fact that no penalties have ever been sought by the Minister or the Commissioner, and they are the only ones who can bring an action for penalties, these sections do not warrant the attention which they have been paid by the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA>These amendments propose to amend section 79 of the Act to increase the maximum pecuniary penalties for breaches of the consumer protection provisions in part V to $1m for a body corporate and $100,000 for a natural person. At present, the maximum penalties under section 79 of the Act are $100,000 for a body corporate and $20,000 for a natural person.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Rural Adjustment Bill 1992, the States Grants (Rural Adjustment) Amendment Bill 1992 and the Farm Household Support Bill 1992 are a package of Bills to restructure the rural adjustment scheme. The rural adjustment scheme evolved from the rural reconstruction scheme which operated from 1971 to 1977. Its original purpose was to provide Commonwealth funding for low interest, long term loans for farmers facing financial difficulties, to allow them to either become viable or be assisted out of farming. It also recognised that the criteria which governed the welfare safety net for the wage and salary work force is unsuitable for Australia's high capital self-employed farmers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since then, there have been a number of reviews and the current RAS is divided into three parts. Part A provides assistance for structural adjustment purposes in the form of interest subsidies, loans or grants to farmers assessed as being viable in the long term, but who are experiencing short term financial difficulties. Part B is for carry-on purposes for farmers assessed as being viable but experiencing a short term downturn through economic or climatic factors beyond their control. Assistance takes the form of short term interest subsidies or loans. Part C provides assistance in the form of household support, equivalent to Jobsearch, to farmers who are assessed as non-viable for one year with the possible extension of another year. If the farmer decides not to leave he must repay this money. If he leaves, subject to a means test, it becomes part of the $34,000 re-establishment grant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Rural Adjustment Bill 1992 revises the rural adjustment scheme so that at the end of eight years the farm sector, according to the Government, will be `able to thrive in a highly viable economic and natural resource environment, without relying on government assistance for survival and growth'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government says it wants the national drought policy, the IED scheme and the rural adjustment scheme to function in an integrated way to encourage good management practices. Parts A, B and C of the scheme are abolished and there is now only one section which will provide interest subsidies. In normal circumstances eligible farmers will be able to obtain interest rate subsidies of up to 50 per cent. The amount will depend on individual assessment by the State agents of the RAS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Farmers will also be able to obtain grants to improve their skill and to assist with the cost of obtaining financial, planning and other advice relating to their business. This assistance, including the States' administration costs, will be 90 per cent met by the Commonwealth and 10 per cent by the States. In exceptional circumstances, such as severe drought or substantial commodity price downturns, interest subsidies may go higher; in the past, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Crean, has said up to 100 per cent subsidy, but most States are only taking 75 per cent because everything is on a dollar for dollar Commonwealth-State basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council, consisting of up to eight ministerial appointees, is to be established to provide the Minister with advice on the operations of the scheme from a national and strategic perspective. Its job will be to recommend an on-going strategic plan and a proposed annual program for the RAS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The members of the Council will include one representative from the National Farmers Federation, at least one representative of the States, a Commonwealth representative and up to three people with expertise in farm management, financial administration, training, economics and sustainable agriculture. The Minister may also request the Council to provide him with advice on whether exceptional circumstances are affecting farmers and whether additional support is required. The Council will be required to submit an annual report to the Minister. It can form subcommittees and will consult with interested parties, including the States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Farmers considered non-viable will be assisted to leave the farm with a re-establishment grant of up to $45,000 when they have nil or negative assets. This is to provide a deposit on a house for the family as the farm home cannot be sold separately from the farm and has little or no value. The major impediment to a farmer quitting is the family home problem. There will be no other assistance through the rural adjustment scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The States Grants (Rural Adjustment) Amendment Bill ratifies the agreements which have been reached between the Federal Government and the States of New South Wales and Queensland for the distribution of the $14m provided in the Budget for drought assistance by way of interest subsidies. The scheme has been operating since 1 September. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Farm Household Support Bill has been taken out of part C of the rural adjustment scheme. It is now considered a welfare measure. Household support, at rates equivalent to Jobsearch allowance, are available to farmers who are considered non-viable and who cannot obtain finance and need assistance in meeting day to day living expenses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation is within the primary industries and energy portfolio and will be administered by the Department of Social Security on an agency basis. Farm household support will be income tested, but farm assets have been excluded from the assets test, including working capital from the farm. The funds will be available as a loan for two years to those who believe they have a future in farming and to those who make the decision to leave farming. However, the money paid in the first nine months will become a grant for those who leave farming and they may also be eligible for the re-establishment grant through the rural adjustment scheme. If they can leave the farm before the nine months are up, they will be able to cash out the full nine months. With this and the re-establishment grant, it is theoretically possible to get up to $55,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Farmers who do not leave at the end of two years will not qualify for the grant period and will have to repay all the farm household support received. Farmers will only be required to submit an application for farm household support with the Department of Social Security. Jobsearch allowance will still be available to farmers and their spouses under normal and hardship provisions, but farm families who choose Jobsearch will lose their access to the rural adjustment scheme re-establishment grant once the farmer or spouse has received nine months of Jobsearch allowance payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nine months period will be calculated from the introduction of the farm household support scheme. With the introduction of the new scheme, those on the modified scheme introduced in December 1991 until they are no longer eligible&mdash;presumably through improved income&mdash;or when the scheme sunsets in December 1993 will have the option of transferring to farm household support. Those currently receiving farm household support under part C of the rural adjustment scheme will be transferred automatically to the new scheme. Importantly, the new scheme has been agreed to by all State governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been criticism by the coalition of the clumsy attempts by the Labor Government to provide food on the table for cash-starved farmers who usually do not qualify for Jobsearch or other benefits. The failure of those schemes has forced the Labor Government to move closer to coalition policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is abandoning its efforts to provide a Jobsearch allowance to farmers in extreme hardship and is now going back to household support, but this is not to be under the rural adjustment scheme and will still be a loans scheme unless the recipient quits farming. Minister Crean promised unemployment benefits to 2,000 farmers when the scheme was introduced, but only 300 people have been assisted. Why is the new household support scheme being administered by the Department of Social Security? Its staff has a bad track record in dealing with self-employed people. The rural adjustment scheme officers have an understanding of farmers and are better placed to administer the total rural adjustment scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coalition policy to help farmers suffering hardship involves restoring household support as an income tested welfare grant for a period of nine months before any decision has to be made about quitting the farm. We would return the far more limited category of severe drought to the cooperative Federal-State natural disaster arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the coalition will not be opposing these Bills, I point out that the coalition has superior policies to that of the Government with regard to severe drought and household support. Certainly, after the next election we will be in a position to implement them, and will do so. We are also not entirely sure that the splitting of the rural adjustment scheme between the State adjustment agencies and the Department of Social Security is entirely suitable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak on the Rural Adjustment Bill 1992. I bring a message from the people of the bush: the veil of distance and ignorance must be lifted so the Parliament sees clearly the sacrifice and struggle of rural families trying to hold on to Australia's rural heritage and economic future. Rural and mining commodities constitute the bulk of our exports. Our economic dependence on a healthy rural sector is as fundamental as ever. In these times of dramatic trade deficits and foreign debt, it is more precious than ever. Once again it will fall to the rural sector to play a fundamental role in turning the national economy around to stimulate growth and investment once the tide of commodity prices and the weather turn in our favour.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent years many have experienced the worst floods and droughts on record, the highest interest rates, the highest input costs, the greatest fall in commodity prices and the greatest fall in asset values. Rural incomes have plummeted. The wool industry provides a spectacular example of the conditions facing graziers who survived the abolition of the wool floor price. The price of wool is currently around 500c a kilogram. ABARE says that the average cost of production is 610c a kilogram and that the average wool producer will have a negative income of $39,000 this year. It is a matter of time&mdash;time which our producers do not have under the present regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The extent of the crisis has been exacerbated by many factors. Drought has passed its dry and withered hand over much of southern and central Queensland and western New South Wales. The barren landscape can scarcely support mulga scrub, let alone stock. In many places there have been no lambs for two years. Stock numbers are down by at least a third, the surviving stock are old and weak, and the wool quality is low. Time will also bring rain&mdash;but how many producers will be there to see it, let alone have the resources to take advantage of it? Structural adjustment is a necessary part of any efficient industry, but we are in danger of allowing too many producers to leave. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major difference between this and past rural recessions is the excessive farm debt level. The 1980s saw interest rates of up to 25 per cent for working capital and 23 per cent for property mortgages. Urged on by government experts and lending institutions, producers borrowed to follow, ironically, best risk management practice to enlarge and drought-proof their properties. But with the untimely onset of drought and dramatically rising interest rates, their asset value and equity fell while debt repayments and total debt soared. Any liquid assets have been used to service debt. Labour and other costs have been pared to the bone. Producers are shearing all of their own sheep. There is no money for mustering, shearing and fencing contractors or for property repairs and maintenance, let alone any environmental issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the drought stricken areas, with their greater feed demands, a producer can break even only if there is no debt to service. That means no mortgage, no working capital, no overdraft, no lease repayments and no Bankcards. Yet approximately 1,100 properties in drought stricken south-west Queensland and central west Queensland have an average debt of $350,000. Properties in south-west Queensland alone have a total debt of $200m, up from $140m. Average equity in these grazing enterprises has fallen from 79 per cent in 1985-86 to 58 per cent in 1992-93. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ABARE estimates that those with less than 70 per cent equity are at risk. Under such conditions, producers cannot go forward. Every season their equity in their property is lower; the property and its improvements deteriorate; stock numbers and quality fall. Families in their hundreds, many of whom have lived on the land for generations, are leaving the industry, with nothing to show for the millions of export dollars they have earned for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shearing, fencing, transport and mustering contractors they once employed are now jobless. The business they once brought to regional towns has disappeared, taking several businesses along with it. The orders for plant and equipment and consumer items from city centres are sent no more. Left unchecked, with no commodity prices and weather relief, it is only a matter of time before the relocation and rural upheaval become so great that outback Australia will resemble a bleached skeleton, with foreign buyers circling above. It will take years to redress the economic and social consequences of an eroded rural base and divided regional economies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has introduced some measures under the rural adjustment scheme which aim to alleviate the economic distress of rural families by assisting them to leave and encouraging viable properties to stay in business. An amount of $166.4m has been allocated for 1992-93. In the previous year $157m was spent, of which $14m went to administration. The number of farm household recipients is expected to double and re-establishment grants will increase correspondingly. It appears from this that the same amount of Commonwealth funds will have to cover a lot more people than the previous year, at a time when rural conditions are deteriorating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Eligibility for the main category of assistance, a maximum of $30,000 interest subsidy, is dependent upon proving viability. Under the present market and weather conditions, this is largely a Utopian concept. Access to these funds is therefore very restricted. Even so, two-thirds of the $30m allocated for debt reconstruction interest subsidies has already been spent, though we are only six months into the year. Demand for these funds will only increase. This is a neglectful and shameful response of a government supposedly committed to efficient rural adjustment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The economic and social costs of inadequate assistance now will be paid for in later years. This is not a forward looking or realistically timed adjustment package. It targets too few producers. In drought stricken areas the top 10 per cent or 20 per cent of the properties are ineligible because they are using off-farm assets to carry them through. The next 40 per cent are in the eligibility range but could drop out unless there is rain soon and some increase in the wool price. These producers live in fear of getting a letter from the Government's agent informing them that they are no longer viable and will not be eligible for further interest subsidies. The power of government agencies like the QIDC in Queensland is immense. They hold the future of families and enterprises in their hands. Mail from the QIDC is treated with the same apprehension as an official telegram during the war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new RAS guidelines are still being worked out, leading to more instability. It is impossible to make effective business decisions or to authoritatively advise on the availability of government assistance. Viability is a very precarious commodity. Frequently, a producer is told that he is viable one season but not the next, or that he is doing too well one year and too badly the next. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is the bottom 50 per cent of producers who are ineligible for these subsidies because the Government does not consider that they can become viable in the long term with the level of assistance being offered. Just the presence of off-farm income sustaining the property can lead to an ineligibility ruling. Rejected farmers and their wives then work twice as hard on and off the farm to make up the differences that a $30,000 interest subsidy would make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the inefficient producers have already left. The lowest 10 per cent of producers have so little equity that their future in the industry must seriously be doubted, but that still leaves 40 per cent of producers out in the cold. Thousands of farming families are left to carry on as best they can with no assistance to keep the property running and their assets intact. Producers who paid $20 an acre four years ago would be lucky to get $4 an acre now. They are trapped between clinging to their capital investment in the hope of better returns in the future and walking out with nothing except a re-establishment grant from the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is very little demand for sheep grazing land while the wool stockpile exists and the drought continues. The future of both the wool industry and the land itself is at stake.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The RAS legislation allows for a $45,000 re-establishment grant for producers who sell up and walk out with next to nothing within two years of taking farm household support. I do not wish to criticise the provision of this grant because I know that every dollar is appreciated by the producers who have no option but to leave. However, the story does not end once the farmer leaves, nor is the cheque his to do what he wants with it. It is generally drawn down for a deposit when the ex-farmer has found a house to purchase.

Children's education, that essential ingredient of a clever country, is being terminated early as parents can no longer bear the expensive burden of sending their children away to school. This is a great loss not only to the children's future but also to their country's future.

Water rationing and recycling is a great burden on household chores. It is only relatively early summer, but already babies are being bathed five times a day to keep them cool.

Sometimes they stay in town with their children while their husbands carry on alone at the property. It is the women who are bringing in the cash that puts food on the table and fuel in the dozer, not necessarily in that order. It is the women who struggle with the stream of government forms inquiring into every aspect of their lives as they attempt to tap into some form of assistance. It is extremely difficult to provide the necessary paperwork when one's accountant has not been paid for two or three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The assistance being offered is slim indeed. Under the old scheme, wives could apply for the standard Jobsearch allowance, or the JSA hardship category, which took into account their specialist situation of being so-called asset rich while income poor.

Husbands seldom applied because they were trying to keep the property running.</PARA>

Those who remain able to qualify for the standard JSA will forfeit all rights to a re-establishment grant after nine months. So the only real alternative for cash strapped families will be to apply for the farm household support, which is the same rate as JSA. This farm household support comes with strangling strings attached. It is basically a loan. If one can sell one's property within nine months of first receiving FHS, then nine months of farm household support is provided as a grant. If one takes more than nine months to leave, one has to pay the extra FHS back. If the farm is not sold within two years, there will be no further payments and the grant then becomes a loan. The Commonwealth will step in to recover the outstanding 24 months of FHS debt. If the producer wishes to continue to receive FHS after nine months, he must commit himself to selling his property. To apply for FHS is really to commit one's family to leaving the property, leaving the region and leaving the whole rural sector behind. </PARA>

It is a no-win situation for the grazing industry which is losing irreplaceable, expert and efficient producers; and it is a no-win situation for the overall national interest, which will depend on the rural sector to drive an economic recovery once drought and market conditions improve. Nowhere else in Australia does accepting unemployment or other benefits mean that one has to sell up one's home and pay the money back later. Nowhere else are our best performing exporters being repatriated to city unemployment queues. It is not surprising that producers are preferring to work themselves into the ground and live hand to mouth rather than take this tied assistance from the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the hundreds of thousands of unemployed in the cities were told to pay back their payments after nine months, and sell their houses into the bargain, there would be an outcry.

Last financial year, the Government spent $5.4m of household support to keep 766 producers in basic necessities.

As the drought and low commodity prices continue, fewer and fewer will be able to satisfy the RAS eligibility guidelines relating to viability.

The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) has put out a paper saying that 6,000 to 7,000 producers will finish their RAS contracts this year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I rise to speak on the Rural Adjustment Bill 1992, the States Grants (Rural Adjustment) Amendment Bill 1992, the Farm Household Support Bill 1992 and the Income Equalisation Deposits Laws Amendment Bill 1992, I could not help but be impressed by Senator Boswell's speech. He obviously spoke on behalf of Queensland, which is in the grip of a very serious drought. Fortunately, on the western side of the continent things are not quite as bad because of the reasonably good seasons that we have had since 1983. That was when the last drought was and, of course, that was when this Government went into power and started the drought in the west. It claims to have ended the drought of the east, but it started the drought in the west. Fortunately, we have had only the one in that period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other reasons why, as Senator Boswell said, there are problems with the rural industry, and one is low commodity prices. I know that wool has taken a hit in the last three or four years in Australia, but that was not the fault of even this Government. Yes, it was a mistake of the then Primary Industries and Energy Minister, Mr Kerin, not to call a halt to the reserve price scheme before it was stopped, but it was also the greed of the industry which led to its downfall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Commodity prices are fairly reasonable in the wheat industry, considering the bad situation in the northern hemisphere where a lot of the wheat has been downgraded. At a meeting that I attended about six weeks ago in Western Australia, I was castigated for saying a few things&mdash;in other words, for telling some home truths. But I found out at that same meeting that even the high rainfall areas have their problems&mdash;and I did not quite think that problems had extended to those areas. I farm in a low rainfall area. We always used to say, and still say, `If only we had better rainfall, what we would be able to do'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, having had a good look at the high rainfall areas this year, I can see a lot of problems. People in those areas call it a green drought. They have not been hit by wool commodity prices going down, and beef prices, although not so good, are reasonable, but other factors have affected them&mdash;as well as the Government's policies, of course, but I will leave them aside for the moment and concentrate on the factors relating to the farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past there have been poor commodity prices, as I have mentioned; there has been some bad management; and, worst of all, there has been bad advice from farm advisers and bank managers. I have always said that if I had to use a farm adviser I would leave farming, and I still say that today. Unfortunately, some farmers have relied too much on what farm advisers have had to say&mdash;and we might have one in the chamber now&mdash;and far too much on bank managers who have vested interests in the money they are spending. I believe that, in the years to come, if farmers are better educated to make their own decisions on finance, it will improve their farm management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Boswell led me away from what I was going to speak on&mdash;that is, the Rural Adjustment Bill, the Farm Household Support Bill and, mainly, the Income Equalisation Deposits Laws Amendment Bill. I will address the Income Equalisation Amendment Bill first. This is almost a sessional Bill, because every year of the five years that I have been in this place we have amended the income equalisation deposits legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Labor came to Government in 1983 the real changes started in IED. The original Bill was brought in 1976, under the Fraser Government&mdash;I think it was introduced by Ian Sinclair in the other place&mdash;and the income equalisation deposits scheme was brought in. It means exactly what it says&mdash;excess funds can be deposited in one year, and kept there for the bad times. That was done at a low interest rate, just to cover inflation. I believe that scheme worked very well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, with the ascent of the Labor Government in 1983, Senator Walsh, a farmer himself, as Minister for Finance, believed&mdash;and I suppose believed rightly&mdash;that there was some abuse of IEDs. I maintain that if there were any abuses of IEDs, they would have been very minimal. Unfortunately, Senator Walsh changed what I believe was not a bad system at all. The first IEDs were subject to low interest rates&mdash;they were increased a bit later on&mdash;and were getting well used. At that time, I believe there was about $180m in funds&mdash;I might be wrong but it was about that figure. If someone knows better, please let me know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The IED scheme started to go wrong when the interest rates were increased, because then they were used rather as an investment, I suppose, and not really as an IED&mdash;income equalisation deposit. But as I said, Senator Walsh thought that the scheme was being rorted. It might have been, very slightly, but not on a big scale. There was a second edition under the Fraser coalition Government and the interest rates were put up. The third edition was Senator Walsh's first edition, and I do not really remember what he then did with them exactly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Beyond that Senator Walsh went into a second edition, with investment and non-investment portions. Withholding tax at 29 per cent was retained on the non-investment portion of 61 per cent. We are now on the fifth edition, where the minimum deposit has decreased from $5,000 to $1,000, the maximum deposit has increased from $250,000 to $300,000 and withholding tax is down from 29 per cent to 20 per cent. The fact is that the average tax rate for a farmer in a recession, a drought or at a time of low commodity prices would now be in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has also been the creation of farm management bonds, where interest is paid on 80 per cent of the deposit rather than 61 per cent. These bonds can be withdrawn only for drought, fire and flood. I agree with that. To have true income equalisation deposits, one must be able to hold them in the scheme for as long as possible for those eventualities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, farmers are not able to make a deposit in the bonds if they have off-farm income of more than $50,000. I believe this is wrong. If the Government wants to encourage this new system, I believe the bonds should be open to everyone. I have always believed that off-farm income was the best part of income equalisation deposits because it was always steady. Unfortunately, this Government is discouraging farmers by differentiating between off-farm and on-farm income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any interest that is obtained by farmers as carry-on finance would be declared non-farm income. For instance, the income of any person in this place is certainly non-farm income. Non-farm income also includes ownership of a few units or shares in a local co-op and that sort of thing. For the farm management bond system to work properly and be a genuine tool to even out a farmer's situation, a farmer should be able to store reserve cash, just as he has reserve fodder in case of a drought. I believe that that would be a good way to go. However, anyone with that sort of other off-farm income is wiped out. I presume that part of that off-farm income is the interest on IEDs. If the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer thinks I am wrong in this, I ask him to correct me later. I have already mentioned bank interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What knocks the IEDs in the long term and does not make them very attractive is that they are still covered under the provisional tax arrangements. I cannot see why the new rate of 20 per cent withholding tax should be applied to the 61 per cent because it is already covered by provisional tax. The farmers need to put money into IEDs but the provisional tax tends to kill the scheme off. One solution would be for the Government to remove the withholding tax. Provisional tax is set at 10 per cent. This year I believe there will be an 8 per cent uplift in the provisional tax factor. I have mentioned the provisional tax readjustment with all the penalties to go with it. So much for the IEDs. The Government has made a forward step with the FMB scheme and the payment of interest on 80 per cent and with the reduction of withholding tax to 20 per cent, but I am afraid it has not gone far enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make a few brief points on the Rural Adjustment Bill 1992. As Senator Tambling pointed out, this Bill abolishes parts A, B and C of the rural adjustment scheme. Only one section will now provide interest subsidies where, under normal circumstances, eligible farmers will be able to obtain interest rate subsidies of up to 50 per cent. The Commonwealth will pick up 90 per cent of that cost and the States will pick up 10 per cent of it. I understand that in extreme circumstances, such as drought, the Commonwealth will pick up more of the cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I welcome the measure. It is preferable to having RAS divided into parts A, B and C, as there have been many problems with RAFCOR in each State. The subsidies can be used in various ways. They can even be used to obtain grants to improve skills and, as I said earlier, to assist with financial planning advice. That is very important and very welcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another Bill at hand is the Farm Household Support Bill 1992. This Bill, which comes under the Department of Primary Industries and Energy portfolio, will be administered by the Department of Social Security. I believe that it should always have been so, because it is a social security measure and rural dwellers should be treated like anyone else in Australia. Farm household support will be income tested but farm assets, including working capital, are not to be counted in the assets test. We thanked the Government for that small mercy at the time. The Farm Household Support Bill brings rural dwellers into line with their city cousins, except that there is a limit on the grant. The grant lasts for up to nine months, but beyond that it takes the form of a loan. Senator Boswell pointed out that that provision should be looked at a second time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I intend to address very briefly the national residue survey levy legislation. This legislation will enable the Commonwealth to recover 100 per cent of the costs of residue testing instead of the current 60 per cent. I know that the Cattle Council of Australia, on behalf of those in the cattle industry, has made a big objection to this legislation. Our family is also involved in the cattle industry. We believe that we should pay our share of residue testing, but I also believe that the public interest has a stake in this matter. A fifty-fifty payment system, which is the coalition's policy, should be the way to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome most of the measures that are contained in these Bills. For a change, the rural industry Bills are not being debated at 2 a.m. on the last day of sittings, which is what usually happens. </PARA>

In particular, the fuel levy will be abolished under a coalition government. Senator McMullan will immediately want to tell me that farmers do not pay a fuel levy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Nothing stands as a greater testament to this Labor Government's incompetence than the continuing crisis in the bush. While unfavourable commodity prices and drought have been contributing factors to the desperate situation of many farmers, undoubtedly the central cause has been the failed economic management of this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Hawke-Keating Labor governments have failed rural people by dramatically raising interest rates to induce the recession we had to have. As a result, many farmers were irretrievably crippled when their interest rates on existing loans soared to more than 20 per cent as against 14 per cent when originally undertaken. Although interest rates have subsequently fallen under the impact of Australia's worst recession since the Great Depression, the damage has been done, with debt having compounded on debt as a direct consequence of the Government's single-pronged approach to economic management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Hawke and Keating Labor governments have also failed rural people by failing to initiate adequate micro-economic reform to allow farmers to reduce their costs of production to offset to some extent poorer commodity prices. In short, the Government has failed dismally to take initiatives of which it should have been capable to remove Australia's farmers from the worst cost-price squeeze they have experienced. Caught in this bind, farmers have desperately sought to survive through cost cutting of every possible kind&mdash;cost cutting which does not necessarily improve efficiency or productivity of the farming enterprise because it often involves not undertaking maintenance when needed or replacing machinery when necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Farmers were also forced to make great efforts to obtain off-farm jobs and income. This has meant a serious imbalance between the farm labour force and the amount of work to be done covering the ground and maintaining farm standards, because many farms are not returning an adequate income to support their labour requirements. Not only have farmers been unable to employ workers to maintain standards but also in too many cases even the next generation of farmers, the children of owners, who would normally work on the farm and eventually take it over, have had to leave for other jobs because of grossly inadequate farm income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Meanwhile, there is too much work for the farmer to get through. This has been described as the `work for three, pay for one syndrome', which would certainly not be tolerated in any other industry. Serious consequences for farmers have been stress, overwork and increased health problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Undoubtedly family farms are the normal unit of rural settlement and production and, indeed, the most efficient such unit. It should be the aim of public policy to keep the family farm as the basis of agricultural settlement. There is no real benefit to Australian agriculture or its key role as an export earner in seeing large tracts of land transferred to agribusiness firms, foreign investors or investment companies which have no real interest in the future of rural districts. The local experience, expertise, attachment to the land and community and sheer staying power of family farmers cannot be replaced by alternative forms of ownership and operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly not all farmers, irrespective of their management skills or long term prospects, should be bailed out by the taxpayers. But we should be seeking to retain as high a rural population density and as many farm families as possible rather than seek to remove farm families. In particular, there should be encouragement for the next generation of farmers to fight through the current malaise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Inadequate net farm incomes have forced a large proportion of young people to leave farms against their own desires. The average age of farmers continues to rise and the arrival of a new generation is further delayed. The serious question is whether young people who have been forced to leave the farm will ever return to take over from their parents. This is an issue which public policy must urgently address. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This malaise afflicts primary production Australia-wide. It has been researched and documented in detail over the last seven years in the Cleve area of Eyre Peninsula in South Australia by Dr Peter Smailes from the Department of Geography at the University of Adelaide. In one of his studies, he concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is impossible to conduct field work on Eyre Peninsula without absorbing the feeling of bitterness, frustration and anger among farmers at the heavy interest repayments, costs, charges, taxes and apparent unwillingness or inability of the community at large to give meaningful assistance in a situation over which they have no control. To work so hard for almost no returns, and at the same time to have to pay so much to service debts incurred under quite different conditions, is understandably a cause of great personal stress.</PARA>
<PARA>This highlights the urgent need for much greater micro-economic reform, including deregulation of the labour market to allow a reduction in the cost side of farmers' equations. The issues I have raised also provide a basis for assessing the four pieces of rural assistance legislation before us this evening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Income Equalisation Deposits Law Amendment Bill seeks to amend the IED scheme to reduce the amount of withholding tax at the time of withdrawal, to reduce the amount required to make a deposit and to increase the maximum amount allowed in the scheme. It also introduces farm management bonds, which are a modified form of IEDs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, over its time in office, this Government has demolished the IED scheme originally put in place by the Liberal and National parties. The purpose of the scheme was to encourage farmers to insure themselves by boosting their savings in years of good income and thereby provide for themselves when times were less abundant. But there had to be an incentive for them to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout the 1980s, when this Labor Government was tampering with the scheme, it removed that inducement. Indeed, when the Government claimed yet again a couple of years ago that it would be improving the scheme, it announced changes 12 months in advance. But, had that scheme as announced come into effect from the time of its Budget announcement, there would have been a not inconsiderable investment made at that time by the wool industry, because the wool reserve price scheme was still intact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the 12-month delay in introducing the scheme's changes, the Government ripped additional income tax from woolgrowers' pockets. This effectively prevented sound and considerable investment from the industry in IEDs which would have provided invaluable assistance to those woolgrowers now and which would have ultimately meant a reduced need for them to call on the rural adjustment scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These present changes merely demonstrate that the Government has at least recognised those fundamental flaws and inadequacies and is prepared to make adjustments, albeit inadequate ones. If the scheme is to be worthwhile and beneficial for farmers, why should a farmer be paid interest on only 61 per cent of the cash he deposits in an IED, when he would most probably be paying tax at a rate well under 39c?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, why should a farmer in a desperate predicament such as drought pay 20 per cent withholding tax when he draws out of either scheme when he has already paid provisional tax? Why is it that a farmer who faces some personal adversity should suffer a loss of interest on 19 per cent of his farm management bond deposit just because he draws out at a time when it is officially not a drought or a catastrophic natural disaster? Do his personal circumstances make his suffering any less real? Even with these changes, the IED scheme remains grossly inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the rural adjustment amendment, the legislation will simplify the existing scheme by implementing a single interest rate subsidy scheme of up to 50 per cent for those considered viable, with an additional rate subsidy in exceptional circumstances. However, it depends on just how much the individual States are prepared to provide and, as we already know, this has often been too little, too late. Indeed, there is clearly a greater need here for the States to accept their responsibility in this regard and to extend their obligations to include the difficulties experienced by farming people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Shortcomings remain with the transfer of the household support component to the Department of Social Security away from the Rural Adjustment Authority, although the Government has recognised the failure of its earlier attempts to apply the Jobsearch allowance to farmers. Some 12 months ago about 2,000 farmers were to become eligible. The rural sector claimed that at least 5,000 needed to come within the criteria if the assistance were to make an impact. I understand that ultimately only some 300 came within the scheme and it has been dropped. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The household support legislation provides an income tested and off-farm asset tested equivalent for a nine-month period as a grant, provided that the farmer then leaves the farm. I understand that the rehabilitation grant is also being increased to $45,000. However, some problems exist when looking at household support and rural adjustment together, particularly in light of my earlier comments regarding the need to keep as many as possible on the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government must look at the situation of the farmer differently. How does one assess the viability of a farmer or the productivity of a farm in a drought or during a severe downturn in commodity prices? How does the Government calculate at that time whether a farmer would have a viable future in a year's time? The fact is that one cannot, and the Government should at least acknowledge that a farmer needs time to sort out the maze which then closes in around the family in such a situation. The Government should not immediately attempt to draft him through one gate or the other. Market forces or climatic conditions may change, which may eventually assist that farmer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is where the coalition policy on this matter is so much better. Providing the farmer with a nine-month, income-tested welfare grant, equivalent to the Jobsearch allowance and which is not conditional on whether or not the farmer finally leaves the farm, is an infinitely more sensible and equitable approach. There are also problems with regard to this issue concerning the inflexibility of the Department of Social Security, which is unable to deal effectively with asset rich, cash poor clients. It is not a Department that is structured to deal efficiently with the needs of farmers in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, as Senator Panizza said, the Government's inability to manage its legislative program means that, as in the past but perhaps even worse this year, legislation dealing with rural issues is crammed in at the last minute of the sittings of this Parliament and those of us on the Opposition side have to restrict the time that we speak on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In drawing my remarks to a close, I draw attention to the changes to drought relief which, again, is an improvement, but still does not match the provision provided by the Opposition whereby, when in government, we will restore to the list of cooperative Federal-State arrangements for disasters, measures dealing with the occurrence and effects of severe drought. While we do not oppose this legislation, we certainly draw attention to its inadequacies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Labor Government ought to feel ashamed that it has misunderstood and misread the needs of farmers and their families for so long and not dealt with them in an optimal way. In addition to needing a Liberal and National Party in government to provide a more relevant approach to rural assistance, farmers, perhaps more than any other section of the community, desperately need the benefits which only Fightback can provide. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are addressing a package of Bills that will greatly affect rural Australia and rural Australians. The Income Equalisation Deposits Laws Amendment Bill, the States Grants (Rural Adjustment) Amendment Bill, the Rural Adjustment Bill and the Farm Household Support Bill go together to map out the Government's program for farming in the 1990s. Before I address details specific to these Bills, I want to note that the Democrats will be moving amendments which will be circulated shortly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to talk in general and historic terms about the approach that is being adopted here tonight. I believe this package takes us further along the economic rationalist path in agriculture. It is aimed at further corporatisation of agriculture with little regard for community consequences. It seems to be the Government's intention to remove as many farm families as is possible, not only from the land but from rural communities altogether. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United States now has lost about 30 per cent of its farm families since Reaganomics began in the 1980s and we are right on track to emulate them. In fact, a front page report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekly Times</EMPHASIS> two weeks ago under the headline `Farmer exodus tipped' suggested that rural counsellors around Australia had been told that one in five farm families may indeed be forced to leave the land over the next five years&mdash;that is another 25,000 farmers&mdash;with the catalyst being the Federal Government's revamped rural adjustment scheme. The Democrats question whether that is a sensible thing to do&mdash;encouraging in economic, social and environmental terms what really is a disaster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The emphasis of the Government is on adapting to the challenges of the free market. It seems to be loath to take note of the lessons taught by history of world agriculture. We could draw parallels for example with the effect of free trade on Roman farmers more than 2,000 years ago. One reason for the decline of grain farming in Italy was the importation of grain into Rome from the grain rich lands of Sicily and Egypt. In Sicily, these grain lands had been appropriated by rich men and scheming politicians who farmed them with slave labour. As a result, the markets of Rome were flooded with cheap grain. Indeed, grain became so cheap that farmers who still owned small pieces of land could not get enough money from the grain that they raised to support their families or to pay their taxes. They were forced to turn their farms over to the rich landlords. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the land of Italy slave gangs began to take over, working under overseers in place of the old Roman farmers who had been the very backbone of the state. The farmers, after their land had been lost, went inside the city walls leaving behind the scythe and the plough. They worked, now and then, on a small wage. They ate mostly bread from the wheat which was distributed to them by any politician who wanted their votes at the time of an election. The land itself became poor. The use of slaves meant the land was worked badly. This example from ancient Italy, I believe, mirrors a lot of the concerns that we face today right down to the provision of welfare for displaced farmers. If we learn nothing from history, we are doomed to make the same mistakes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ideological debate over free trade is relatively recent, dating back to the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The first climax to the debate came in 1846 when the free trade advocates in the British Parliament voted to repeal the corn laws which regulated imports of wheat in order to protect British farmers from sudden price fluctuations. The main advocate of the repeal, Richard Cobden, who is still the darling of the Right today, was quite aware of the social, economic and environmental consequences of his proposals. The soul mates of Richard Cobden have control of agricultural policy in this country at the moment, and their policies are wreaking just as much havoc amongst small farmers, consumers and the environment as they did in Britain in the nineteenth century and in Italy some 2,000 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two competing visions have emerged of the future of agriculture. The first, often referred to as sustainable agriculture, calls for economic and social initiatives to protect the environment and family farms. This approach emphasises the use of public policy to promote economically secure family farms and rural communities; to preserve soil, water and biodiversity; and to use farming practices which are less chemically and energy intensive&mdash;without rejecting technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposing view is the free market, free trade or deregulatory approach which pursues economic efficiency above all else to deliver crops and livestock at the lowest possible prices. Almost all social, environmental and health costs are, to use the economic jargon, externalised. In other words, they are left out of the price and paid for not directly by the buyer but by taxpayers and, in some cases, by future generations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The neo-classical view seeks to wind back or eliminate farm programs such as price supports and supply management and land use provisions designed for environmental protection. In world trade the opening of state and national borders to unlimited and deregulated imports and exports is supported. These policies are heavily promoted by powerful agribusiness corporations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently the debate between these conflicting views has been given particular prominence by the trade negotiations under GATT and NAFTA. We are all aware of the position of the Europeans and of the French in particular. They have taken farm support to an absurd extreme. But we must also remember that United States policy&mdash;if one were in any doubt&mdash;is driven by agribusiness economists with the aim of driving other exporting countries out of the world market. Former US Republican Senator Boschwitz, a leading light on the agriculture committees in the mid-1980s, stated this as an explicit goal. In 1985 he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we do not act to discourage these countries now our worldwide competitive position will continue to slide and be much more difficult to regain. This should be one of our foremost goals of our agricultural policies and the Farm Bill.</PARA>
<PARA>The US agribusiness economists promised a huge growth in export volumes, which they said would be more than enough to offset the drop in prices. They were mistaken. Although export volumes rose, lower prices meant that their value fell. In fact, in constant dollar terms, US farm exports in 1990 reached only half the value of those in 1981, even though the amounts exported were far greater. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why did this happen? It happened because other countries simply did not stop exporting just because the United States wanted them to. When the US orchestrated lower prices, other countries lowered their prices to match. The Europeans have kept pace with all of this through their own huge subsidy system of price supports. The world has been presented with extremely low price grain exports with prices far below the cost of production&mdash;and the result has seen many farmers in Australia and the rest of the world wiped out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Farmers have searched for ways to produce at lower and lower costs. The first obvious way is to intensify production methods. Australia leads the world in finding sustainable improvements in this area, but it has not been enough. There is evidence that farmers are having to abandon long term soil and water conservation practices to try to reduce short term costs. To the farmers themselves, and to all of us, this is unacceptable, but they really have little choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second approach has been to try to reduce input costs. This is why we are constantly hearing about micro-economic reform. The third way farmers have survived has been to take off-farm work to subsidise their farming operations, or for one member of the family to move away to take off-farm work. The stress upon families and communities has been severe, with large increases in marital problems, family breakdown and suicide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Make no mistake: country communities are in crisis. Each time a farm family is forced to leave a local community, the impact is enormous. The effects ripple through the community. The local store has fewer customers. The local post office and the local bank may not survive. After losing a few children the local school may indeed lose teachers as well. They are all affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of our rural communities are at a crisis point in terms of economic and social sustainability. Some 35 per cent of our young people between the ages of 18 and 35 are leaving rural Australia, never to return. We must question whether the rush to a leaner, meaner agribusiness-based corporate farming sector is in the long term best interest of rural Australia. I do not believe it is and the Democrats certainly do not believe it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators will be aware of my interest in the area of rural incomes policy from the time I arrived in this place some 2 1/2 years ago. My interest comes from having lived in the country for many years, from having friends on farms still surviving and managing to hang on, and also from having a family living in rural Australia. Now, of course, this is part of my responsibility as a senator representing South Australia. I cannot claim, as can many honourable senators who are taking part in this debate, to be directly involved in farming industries, but that does not mean I cannot or do not understand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now want to turn to the specific Bills we have before us. I want to concentrate on two Bills in this package&mdash;the Rural Adjustment Bill 1992 and, in particular, the Farm Household Support Bill 1992. The objects of the Rural Adjustment Bill are, firstly, to foster the development of a more profitable farm sector that is able to operate competitively in a deregulated financial and market environment; and, secondly, to improve the competitiveness of the farm sector in a sustainable manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government says that there will be a focus on improved farm productivity, profitability and sustainability through structural adjustment. What it is talking about is changing forever the nature of the farm sector. I remind the Senate of the article that I mentioned earlier. That article pointed out that rural counsellors had been warned that 20 per cent of farmers could be adjusted out&mdash;which is a lovely, non-emotive phrase for basically saying `getting them out of farming as quickly as possible'. But adjusting them out to do what?  This raises all sorts of questions about what the Government really intends for these people. Where will they go?  Where will they find work?  What will their families do? It also raises questions about what the Government means by `sustainable'. It seems to be exclusively sustainable profit. What about socially sustainable rural communities? Nowhere is it explained if or where this all fits in with regional development strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In formulating the Bill, the Government commissioned an allegedly comprehensive review by independent consultants and undertook extensive consultations with States and farm sectors. I believe that this review team set out with a very narrow focus and effectively delivered exactly what the Government wanted. It is completely in line with that economic rationalist approach I outlined earlier and, as I said then, we have a number of problems with that philosophy. We believe it is taking agricultural policy in the wrong direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The direction is to be overseen by the new Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council that the Bill proposes be set up. This Council is a worry to us. It will have enormous power over the rural sector and, like the independent review team which devised this Bill, the views which will dominate are those of the agricultural bureaucrats and big agricultural businesses. The composition of this Council will be vital to the future of Australia's agriculture. As it stands, I do not believe that it is truly representative; it is certainly not representative enough of all the views that we should be hearing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequently, I will be moving amendments to increase the size of the Council from 8 to 12, with the extra four members being two from the major banks and two from the coalface of rural counselling. I hope the new Council will, as a matter of priority, undertake a comprehensive review of debt restructuring options outside the present rural adjustment scheme. In this respect, they could call and build on work currently being done in South Australia by the rural support working group, which is a combination of grassroot farmers, bankers and rural counsellors. Options they have explored include partial debt write off, debt splitting, debt discounting and property lease-back and purchase. I believe there should have been far more work done on these things by the so-called independent review team on whose recommendations this legislation is based. I do not have time to go into all of these options but they are quite well worth pursuing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also ask whether the new Council will be looking at alternative exit incentives besides re-establishment grants. Options include performance agreements and putting in place an effective debt mediation system, such as exists in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of favourable developments connected with this Bill which I will comment on. The most important for South Australian farmers is the development of consistent Federal policy guidelines relating to the administration of RAS. Honourable senators may not be aware of the problems with the administration of RAS in South Australia. The Rural Finance and Development Division, under the control of Mr Graham Broughton, has taken a very inflexible, unsympathetic and hardline approach to the administration of RAS. The RFDD in South Australia has imposed completely ludicrous conditions on farmers, which I believe are not found in other States. For example, to access re-establishment grants, farmers have to sign a statement declaring that they will not return to farming within five years, work as an employee for the new farm owner or share-farm any farm property. Not only do farmers have to sell their property; their skills must be lost forever to the farm sector. This is just ridiculous. I look forward to the South Australian administration being brought into line by the new Federal guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another problem currently faced in South Australia is the rumoured closure by RAS of TRACS, the rural adjustment coordination service, which undertakes a specialist role, offering independent financial analysis and outlining personal business plans and business options. It is in danger of being eliminated. It brings together primary producers, rural counsellors and the financial institutions. The TRACS coordinators currently have a portfolio of some 450 cases covering all sorts of adjustment problems. It seems to me that if the focus is on structural adjustment, and if that is what the Government is promising should occur, these services will be needed more than ever. I trust that the South Australian RAS authority will be kept well and truly in line by the new Federal guidelines in this respect as well. The $45,000 re-establishment grant is certainly welcomed for those who will qualify. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the Farm Household Support Bill. The thrust of this Bill, as described on the title page, is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An Act relating to the provision of income support, and financial incentive to leave the rural industries, to primary producers without a long-term productive, sustainable and profitable future in the sector.</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill sets up a farm household support payment to replace part C of RAS. The objects of the Bill are to provide financial assistance to farmers who are unable to meet day-to-day living expenses and cannot get commercial loans and to provide financial incentives for such persons to leave farming. To qualify for farm household support payments, the farmer must have a certificate of inability to access finance from a financial institution. This means that a farmer cannot access commercial carry-on finance. In other words, we are dealing with the worst off farmers&mdash;the borderline cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The support is available for up to two years at a level up to the Jobsearch allowance. There is the usual income and assets test. The income test is the same as for JSA. The assets test is an assets test excluding the tools of trade&mdash;at last&mdash;that is, farm land, machinery and livestock. The rationale for exemption is as outlined by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) in his second reading speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats see this as a major breakthrough. For the first time since I have been here the Government has recognised the need to give farm assets special treatment. The Democrats have long argued that if farm assets are included the majority of farm families immediately exceed the normal asset test limits, excluding them from many farm support payments regardless of the size, often negative, of their income. We do not see payments which are designed to put food on the table and meet basic clothing and educational needs as subsidies for uneconomic enterprises. They are a basic human right and it is surely one of the fundamental tenets of social justice that people are supported in times of need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope the principle will now be extended to Austudy and the new family support payment&mdash;that is, the former family allowance and family allowance supplement. Were the former Minister for Social Security here, I am sure he would fondly remember my attempts to exempt tools of trade from assets tests for Austudy, the family allowance, the family allowance supplement, the Jobsearch allowance, pensions and anything else remotely resembling income support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Farm household support is aimed at putting food on the table for the worst off farmers. The problem is that the scheme is a loan. It represents a philosophical sticking point between us, the Government and the Opposition. I did not like it when RAS part C was a loan and we certainly do not approve of it being a loan now. As was mentioned earlier, if unemployment benefits had to be paid back once a person got a job, we would have an enormous outcry throughout our cities. Here we have a situation where farmers who may get out of farming with as little as $45,000 are being asked to pay this back. Indeed, if they hang on even further, they will not even be eligible for the $45,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had discussions with the Department and the Minister's office on this point. They have been very helpful and very open with advice, but we appreciate that it remains a sticking point and we are not going to move the Government. We only hope that when we come to the amendments in the committee stage the Opposition may be so moved. As has been outlined, farmers who do not leave farming at the end of the two-year period will have to pay back that household support with interest. In other words, the Government could well be making a profit out of farmers who are in dire straits. Basically, this amounts to the Government making money out of alleviating poverty. To make it clear, we are talking about farmers who need a payment to put food on the table, but they may end up after two years with a debt of some $20,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats believe that the only strings which should be attached to the farm family is that the farmer must consult on a regular basis with rural diagnostic experts to ascertain possibilities and to set up all the options available, including various forms of debt restructuring and land management. This, I understand, is an intention of the legislation. My amendments retain the incentive offered that if farmers decide to go at any time within the first nine months, the whole nine-month farm household support amount will be paid in full as a grant. The Democrats believe access to re-establishment grants provides sufficient incentive to leave, without the threat of destitution or another debt if they do not. The bottom line to us is that under the normal process of commercial loans, those farmers who are genuinely unviable will be forced to leave the land anyway. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Rural Adjustment Bill 1992 and related Bills, and to compliment my colleagues Senators Tambling, Boswell, Panizza and Chapman for their contributions. Apart from one aspect, I cannot find much fault with what Senator Lees said about the rural adjustment scheme and how it operates. The flawed part of her contribution was her citation of the situation in America. I think she said that some 30,000 farmers in recent years had left their farms, but contradicted that by saying that we should be going down the path of the Americans and the Europeans. The facts show quite clearly that even with all the assistance that has been given to American and European farmers, with the adjustment process, the rate of farmers leaving the industry in those countries has been at least double that in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, that does not mean that the Australian situation is satisfactory&mdash;far from it. But what the current Government fails to understand in terms of farming in this country, in particular, is that farmers are price takers; they have always been price takers except for a couple of notable exceptions. As price takers, the only two areas where they can do something about their operation are the costs of doing business, and in being more efficient in how they go about doing their business. It is a well-known fact that in our major agricultural industries in this country we are recognised as the most efficient in the world. But in the other area of costs the Government has failed the Australian farm sector absolutely dismally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is nothing strange about collapses in commodity prices. Successive governments over the years have used the downturns in world commodity prices to make a case for virtually doing nothing and farmers have learned to live with that. What they cannot live with are the excessive costs that are passed back to the farm sector. That is where I come to the point of them being price takers, because it is not only in the price of their product that they are price takers but also in the services that are delivered to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to give honourable senators one example of a direct result of this Government's policy in terms of high interest rates. During the period of high interest rates, because of the pressure that was put on service industries&mdash;small businesses, for example&mdash;a mechanic's wages at Ravensthorpe went from $17 to $35 an hour. That increase was almost entirely due to the impact of high interest rates on the cost of that service industry. Of course, that cost is now in-built into the system. It will not go away, even though people on the other side of this chamber will claim that they have lowered interest rates. The damage has been done to those small businesses and that price taking will flow through and be there virtually forever and a day. The indirect impact of high interest rates on costs has been very severe; it has been ongoing. As I said, it is not going to go away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight I wish to make some comments about the rural adjustment scheme. I have long argued, and I firmly believe, that the rural adjustment scheme is fundamentally flawed. It is flawed because in the commodity downturns which occur in agriculture, there is a process of adjusting people out of the industry and transferring the debt from those transferred out to another farmer who might be next door or very close. That is what the adjustment process is all about. Under the guidelines of the rural adjustment scheme, it is the so-called most efficient ones who pick up that extra property and that extra debt. But, of course, in the next downturn&mdash;the cycle which goes around&mdash;they cannot handle that debt. Those people who were the most efficient four or five years beforehand suddenly become victims of circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That happens over and over and over again. That is why I say that the rural adjustment scheme is flawed. We cannot predict when we will come out of this recession&mdash;and come out of it we will but, fortunately, it will not be while this current Government is in power. In four or five or six or seven or eight years, whatever it is, when we again have that cyclical turnaround, it will be the very people who picked up the various property that is being adjusted onto other properties during this phase out process&mdash;and I will come to that in a moment or two&mdash;who will be the victims the next time around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There needs to be a circuit-breaker in terms of the whole philosophy behind the rural adjustment scheme. We can go through it. The figures are there. The years are there: 1972, 1976, 1982, 1986, 1991 to 1993. We have had exactly the same pattern every time and nobody seems to be able to come to grips with it and learn what the problem is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to introduce some figures into this debate. I refer to the tragedy which is now occurring in rural Australia. Despite that tragedy, with low commodity prices, we still find that last year, in 1991, agriculture contributed over $21 billion worth of export income to the Australian economy. In my State of Western Australia the figure was almost $3 billion. Yet, when we look at the next set of figures, we find some horrific results. I will quote a few of those. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In New South Wales in 1989-90 farm business profit was $6,493. In 1990-91 it was minus $21,090. In 1991-92 it was minus $34,800. So we have seen a turnaround of approximately $27,000. If we look at the other figures for New South Wales, we find that net capital purchases in 1989-90 amounted to $21,142 per farm. In 1990-91 it dropped to $3,940 per farm. I do not know how many farmers there are in New South Wales, but I do know that there are about 170,000 in Australia, which is approximately one per cent of the population. As I said before, that one per cent of the population produced over $21 billion worth of export income for this country in what was a bad year. The figures for 1990-91, which are the latest figures available, show that net capital purchases have dropped to $3,840 per farm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to my State of Western Australia. In 1989-90, the average farm in Western Australia had a farm business profit of $21,513. In 1990-91 it was minus $27,900. That is a turnaround of very close to $50,000 per property. In 1991-92 it was once again minus $28,500. In 1989-90 the average amount of net capital purchases of farmers in Western Australia was $46,570. In 1990-91 it was $11,880. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even in my small district of Jerdacuttup, which has only 52 farms, that is over half a million dollars of cash flow through the businesses in Ravensthorpe. If we add the cash flow of all those around, it is not difficult to get to $5m or $6m. If we multiply that right across the system, it is no wonder that people say that when things are good in the bush things go well in the city. That is because farmers are high spenders of their income. They do not lock it up in banks; they do not put it under their beds. They use it to put in dams, to build fences, to build sheds and to buy fertiliser and so on. That provides the cash flow for the community. It is well known that the multiplier effect of the dollar that is spent off the farm is second to none in the community. This Government has failed dismally to recognise that aspect of the importance of the farm sector in terms of cash flow and overcoming the problems of the recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I wish to make is about farm debt. To be consistent I will use the figures from New South Wales and Western Australia. Unfortunately, I do not have the time to go into the other States, but they all show similar figures. In 1989-90 average farm business debt in New South Wales was $97,955. In 1990-91 it had risen to $106,780. I do not have the figures for 1991-92 as yet, but they will certainly go up another $10,000 or $15,000 per property. Senator Brownhill, who is in the chamber, would be well aware of the impact that that has had on the viability of farmers in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Western Australia in 1989-90 the average farm debt was $123,685. It rose as a result of those negative incomes to $129,530 in 1990-91. I have the 1991-92 figures for Western Australia. There the average farm debt has risen again, to $134,700. That does no credit to this Government. It has occurred because of its policy of high interest rates and because it has not addressed, in the correct or proper manner, the infrastructure costs or micro-economic reforms at the haste at which they need addressing in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Micro-economic reform, particularly in the areas of transport, a much more accelerated reform on the waterfront, shipping&mdash;whether it be internationally or on State ships&mdash;road transport and rail transport, does not have benefits only for the farm sector; they also have enormous cost benefits for the whole of the community. This is the area in which we can do meaningful things which will allow for a break even point, at least in these times of lower commodity prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would now like to address a couple of points in regard to these Bills before us. Although I believe the assessment process we have before us is fundamentally flawed, it is a minor improvement on the previous scheme. But I still ask, as others here have done tonight, why farmers are treated differently. This scheme has been transferred to the Department of Social Security, as has already been said here tonight. I suggest that, if somebody on unemployment benefits was asked to pay the money back, the third world war would break out in Australia. The Government's approach on this matter is very inconsistent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge that the first nine months of payments now is a grant, but the next 15 months is a loan. Certainly the increase to $45,000 will help a few individuals, but the real area to be addressed is getting the costs down. We can look at some of the other figures around currently. In the wool industry the average price is about 500c a kilo; yet the production cost is 610c. Once again, particularly while we have the stockpile, it is the issue of costs that this country has to address. From those figures, it is not difficult to work out that woolgrowers are losing between $1.10 and $1.50 per kilo under the current price structure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also wish to raise the issue of agriculture and industrial relations. It is fundamental not only to the recovery of the farm sector but also to the recovery of this country. I put it to Senator McMullan, who is sitting here with us&mdash;I note that nobody else from the Government benches is here, other than you, Mr Acting Deputy President&mdash;that when we have the situation in this country where the price of shearing can go up 16 per cent in 12 months, when an industry which is providing an enormous amount of employment is on its knees&mdash;</PARA>

The facts are there; one can go to the Government's own umpire, as it calls the Industrial Relations Commissioner&mdash;the producer of fairness and equity. That is what the Government has done in terms of an industry that is on its knees. It is absolute madness when we have a situation such as this. It is not as if these people in the wool industry are earning bad money. Earlier I gave the figures; while the losses per property are up around $30,000, those properties would pay out individually somewhere between $40,000 and $50,000 per year to get their sheep shorn. If we take that across the particular individuals, from the rouseabout in the shed to the shearer, they earn anything from $25,000 or $30,000 to $50,000 or $60,000 per year. That is what can be addressed in this particular industry. We see all the nonsense that goes on in terms of the so-called weekend work and lack of flexibility which exists in the award. As far as I am concerned, those things are an absolute nonsense. In Western Australia we do not have the sorts of problems that exist in some parts of States on this side of the nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area in the farm sector where costs can be reduced and where the Government can play a positive role is that of the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service. One could cite many examples, but last week, when the nonsense strike action was coming out of Victoria, virtually all of the AQIS inspectors in this country were out on strike, closing down meatworks at an enormous cost to this nation but also at an enormous cost to the individual producers on the ground. They are the ones that have to pick up the burden of this irresponsible action that has gone on here in recent times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, in Western Australia, and I presume in the other States, we found in the peak of harvest CBH workers&mdash;members of the AWU in particular, but the Electrical Trades Union as well&mdash;going out on strike and hindering farmers at the most important time of the year. Farmers are having their incomes reduced by an average of some $30,000 per year, as I have already said. That loss is being exacerbated and costs are being put up. This is where the Government can give some positive leadership. Of course, it does not have the courage to do that; it just jumps as high as its masters in the trade union movement tell it to jump. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government will come out&mdash;as the Minister has already done&mdash;and call me the resident union basher. There are a lot of responsible unions in this country, but those unions that in this case hold the farm sector to ransom deserve to be condemned, because both the AQIS inspectors and the people working for CBH carry out their action at the peak of the killing season or the delivery season and maximise the damage to those individuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude my remarks by re-emphasising what I said at the start. In my view, the rural adjustment scheme is fundamentally flawed, and until such time as that aspect is addressed we will have the merry-go-round every four or five years where there is a sudden surge of interest by the Government to adjust a few more people out of the industry. Quite frankly, it is time that process was stopped and it was readjusted and turned around. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are debating the Rural Adjustment Bill 1992, the States Grants (Rural Adjustment) Amendment Bill 1992, the Farm Household Support Bill 1992 and the Income Equalisation Deposits Laws Amendment Bill 1992. Most of the things that I had to say have already been said, but I would like to reiterate a few of them. Senator Crane spoke very eloquently of some of the complaints, concerns and worries about the amendments that are being made in these Bills. These four Bills are all interwoven and encapsulate the full spectrum of the fortunes and misfortunes of the farming sector. That has been well and truly mentioned here tonight by Senator Boswell, Senator Crane and others. It is impossible to deal at length with each Bill individually, so I will basically address my remarks to all four of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rural adjustment or assistance for the farm sector in times of assessed need has never been administered to the entire satisfaction of all the parties concerned and possibly never will be. However, I believe that the Keating Labor Government's approach to the difficulties facing rural Australia has been too little too late, too inflexible and inappropriate. If one looks at the problems of the rural sector&mdash;Senator Crane has elucidated pretty well on many of them&mdash;most of them have started in the last 10 years under this Government. One of the biggest hits in the guts, if you like, to the farming sector was high interest rates. That has driven many people to the wall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Farmers have also suffered drought&mdash;they have always had droughts&mdash;and the Keating Labor Government has said that drought should be taken out of the natural disasters program. The Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs, of which Senator Crane, myself and others are members, in its inquiry into drought, did not think that was too bad an idea as long as people who were in severe hardship occasioned by drought were looked after in some way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Commodity downturns have caused big problems in the community and also quite horrific costs in the farming sector. In the past year there has been an increase of some 16 per cent in costs in the farming sector&mdash;not only in the actual cost of shearing but also in the cost of shearing a sheep&mdash;as a result of the downturn in wool prices which has caused some horrific problems to the wool growing industry. This legislation streamlines the process a little, but in my view it is not flexible enough and does not offer real assistance to those who ought to be entitled to assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clear evidence was provided to the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs during its drought inquiry that the need for rural assistance and rural adjustment was greatest for those experiencing drought. There were some areas where insufficient rain had fallen for three to four years. Many drought declared areas are entirely wool growing areas. The drought came just as the bottom fell out of the wool market, so it had a double negative income effect on those people. I stress that these financially crippled farmers are, for the large part, in that position due to circumstances beyond their control. In most cases, no amount of preparation would have prevented the present situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said before, farmers do not want handouts; they want a fair go. They want a government that will work with them, not against them as the present Government has been doing for the last few years. At the moment they are seeing a little change of heart with the legislation before us. The Opposition has been advocating for 10 years that we should go back to the old IED scheme. I know that some people on the Government side of the chamber say that it was rorted. I do not believe that the Government should have taken away the good scheme that we had, introduced by Ian Sinclair in conjunction with the Rural and Industries Bank, which did a great deal to help farming communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes to the income equalisation deposit scheme still do not go far enough. This legislation amends some of the changes that this Government made in 1989, but it still does not have the basic criterion: to encourage farmers in good years to put money aside at beneficial rates to provide for the lean years. The scheme is not sufficiently attractive to warrant its success and it highlights the Government's lack of commitment to rural Australia, notwithstanding that, in the One Nation statement, recovery in the rural sector will underpin Australia's recovery. When we look at the One Nation statement&mdash;it is good to see that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) is in the chamber at the moment because he has had a big part to play in the One Nation statement&mdash;it is interesting to see that it says rural industries are going to underpin our recovery and yet&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the inquiry the Committee heard from some 78 people in public hearings and visited eight family properties. Eight per cent of those people had no equity left in their properties and high debt was common to many others in the area. In Queensland we found that one in seven grain properties were for sale, farm debt had increased by 24 per cent in two years, and 30 to 40 per cent of farmers were uncertain of their future with the high probability that half would be leaving farming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the western division of New South Wales, my home State, approximately 66 per cent of the lessees have only 65 per cent equity in their holdings, with average land values dropping by 50 per cent. If the drought had broken 12 months ago it would still have taken five years for the general recovery in that division. Therefore, we need long term planning and long term incentives for people to look after themselves. Many others in that area were only coping because one or both partners were able to find work off the farm. We had instances of the parents going off the farm and the son being left on the western division property just to shoot the kangaroos. This meant that the parents were away, which is not beneficial for the future of that farming property. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Losses in the region of $33,000 a year per farm, which Senator Crane has mentioned, have meant negative incomes. Despite the fact that no money is coming in, there is still a need to maintain a property with stock and feed, and to feed, clothe and educate families. Children have had to be withdrawn from boarding schools because their parents cannot afford the fees. In some instances, there are simply not enough local schools or the nearest schools are too far away. Many parents have had to ask their children not to complete their schooling. They do not have the money to send them to universities or to TAFE institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier I spoke of high interest rates, commodity prices and droughts. I believe that this Government can take a lot of the blame for the problems. It has created an underpaid and under-skilled rural work force. Farmers simply cannot afford to pay workers. They cannot afford to keep their children at school in order to qualify for something other than farming. At the moment it is really a catch-22 situation. Basically, the only growth industry in the western parts of rural New South Wales is the counselling service which is inundated with the problems of desperate people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new rural adjustment arrangements make no real allowance for people who want to stay on their farms and who, given a fair break, can work their way out of their problems. The emphasis has been placed on assisting people to get out of farming rather than on keeping people at it. I wonder about the future of rural areas if people cannot be helped or cajoled into staying on the land. I do not think people will leave the comfort of places like Canberra or Sydney to go out into those western areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Farmers cannot afford to take out more loans, irrespective of interest rate subsidies. The Government had the opportunity, given the special circumstances of the extreme drought and in the absence of any long term strategy, to provide one-off assistance to help farmers restock and reduce their debt. I do not believe that sufficient deserving cases are receiving assistance in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the latest RAS report, total applications for assistance stand at 9,132, which is more than double the 3,455 in the previous year. So a lot of people are looking for help and assistance. There is evidence that the farm household assistance arrangements of RAS are not working. Evidence given last week to a Senate committee hearing shows that despite the overwhelming evidence of need, only 438 farmers were approved for a re-establishment grant by State RAS authorities in 1991-92. To date only 172 have been approved in 1992-93. That seems low when the extent of the hardship is realised. I will cite those figures again: in 1991, 438 applications were approved by the State authorities&mdash;and I think that basically shows up the problems with that scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I finish, I would like to say something about the IED scheme. One of my real concerns is that we have not gone back to the original IED scheme. The Government has taken up the recommendation of the Rural and Regional Affairs Committee  relating to an increase in the size of the investment component. I have talked to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) about the IED scheme. It is all very well to say that a big farmer can look after himself. But even though the maximum is $300,000, the big farmer needs to put away more money. So why should not these farmers be given an incentive of maybe two years running expenses or whatever so that they can really look after themselves in the future?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee recommended a reduction in the minimum amount of deposit and I thank the Government for taking up that good idea. We also suggested a review of the withholding tax provisions. The Government has done a bit about that by reducing the withholding tax provisions that applied to withdrawals from 29 per cent to 20 per cent. What concerns me is that if a farmer has to self assess and does not have to pay that withholding tax, what happens if the season changes dramatically during that year, the amount blows out and instead of going into a lower tax bracket he goes into a higher tax bracket? I have asked that question before of departmental officials, and it still concerns me. Why we have to have a withholding tax payment, I do not know. If a farmer put away a certain amount of money, why can he not get the whole lot of it back in the year that he needs it, without having money held away from him? The other point is the interest only being paid on a component of the total amount of money that farmers put away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is a step in the right direction but the Government has not gone far enough. If we are going to have a viable agricultural base in the future, we need to make sure that the parameters are right for the rural industries in the future so that we have a prosperous rural economy which will help Australia out of the problem it is in at the moment. </PARA>

I reiterate my support for what the Government is putting forward tonight. Most of what I was going to say has already been said. I would particularly like to compliment the Leader of the National Party in the Senate, Senator Boswell, for giving a very eloquent speech. He also put on the record the pain and suffering that he obviously has had described to him by people in those terrible situations that have happened in rural Australia over the last two or three years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like my colleague Senator Brownhill, I am also a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs that looked at the national drought policy. We were told at first-hand of the experiences of some of those poor, unfortunate farmers who are suffering drought not only in the western region of New South Wales but right around Australia. I have some experience in this matter because, like most of the previous speakers, I too come from a rural background. Even though I come from Tasmania I have experienced droughts there. Some people think that we do not experience droughts in Tasmania, but I can assure them we do. When we do experience droughts in Tasmania they have a larger effect on us because we are not geared up for continuous dry spells as farmers are in other parts of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have also been a recipient of the rural reconstruction scheme which was one of the measures in vogue quite a few years ago. The long term, low interest loan is probably one of the reasons why I still have my farm. This was brought out to us in some of the Committee's public hearings. A lot of the old timers, like myself, made the point that the rural reconstruction scheme was effective because it gave them that long term, low interest rate assistance when they most needed it, and their agricultural efficiencies saw them through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that the Government has moved towards the coalition's policy. I commend the Government and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) for that. I just hope that this legislation will prove to be the success which they hope it will be. I believe that they may find that they have to amend it further&mdash;we certainly would under a coalition government; I think Bruce Lloyd has already made that patently clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As was said earlier, as a member of the Rural and Regional Affairs Committee I have received a large number of submissions outlining the failures and hardships caused by the inadequacies of the rural adjustment scheme, particularly in drought situations. Unfortunately, the Committee found that many problems were caused by the fact that rural producers needed to be in a desperate financial position before they were even considered for assistance. Too many of them were too far down the track before they received any assistance at all. One of the problems pointed out in our report is the fact that some farmers were too proud to ask for assistance. By the time they did, they were eligible only for part C of the scheme. By the time they got to part C, it was a case of being over and out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the information of honourable senators and in order to back up what I said about hardship, I will briefly read a couple of extracts from the inquiry's submissions. The submission from Cattle Council of Australia stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The eligibility criteria for RAS limits its use to those producers who have liquidated any substantial off-farm assets and who are generally in an extremely poor financial condition while still being deemed profitable in the long term.</PARA>
<PARA>It was brought forward to us on many occasions that when the crunch came&mdash;the drought and the recession we had to have on top of that&mdash;the people who had built up a reserve of cash off the farm used up their off-farm assets and ended up in a situation where their farm could not carry them on. A Mr W.W. McLaughlin, from Tongo station in New South Wales, a fourth or fifth generation grazier in that area, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main inadequacy with the current government rural policy is that it simply does not provide any general assistance to those in genuine financial need, prior to total collapse.</PARA>
<PARA>One of my major concerns about any assistance is whether we get to the patient before he or she has lost too much blood and falls over. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation before us goes a long way towards alleviating the problems caused by drought situations. In particular, I refer to the establishment of the RAS Advisory Council, which, with the Minister, advises on the operations of the rural adjustment scheme. I notice that the Australian Democrats have put up an amendment to amend the make-up of that Advisory Council. I cannot see the point in it. I have not discussed this amongst my colleagues, but it seems to me that they are being a bit restrictive in not allowing the Minister enough flexibility to appoint the sorts of people that he thinks should be appointed. Nevertheless, I presume that the Democrats have a reason for moving that amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an earlier speech, Senator Tambling outlined those who will be involved in advising the Minister. That will help alleviate the problem of having persons with no experience of the particular financial problems faced by rural producers interpreting the decisions which affect the rural community. Up until now, I believe that one major fault with any assistance from government to the rural community is that it is usually on the advice of bureaucrats and a number of people who have not had a lot of experience on the land. In fact, it is often said that most of the people who end up becoming counsellors or rural advisers are people who have gone broke anyway. They are trying to advise the ones who are left on what to do. I will again quote from Mr McLaughlin's submission:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It seems to me that none of the relevant authorities . . . have an appreciation of the severity of the economic crisis currently being experienced in rural Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Those words come from a man who should know. After all is said and done, something like 150,000 sheep, on his estimation, had died during the drought. The situation was compounded because he had to decide what to do with the ones which were still alive. His property in Sydney had to be mortgaged to keep himself going. So if anybody really knew what it was all about, it was him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem that he raised about the economic crisis currently being experienced has certainly been pointed out by more than one speaker here tonight. For those people who are left in the rural areas, the problem still remains and it is being highlighted by the Government's decision not to adopt the coalition's income tested household support scheme. Rather than make farmers undergo a lengthy process of bureaucratic tests, the coalition's policy, which has been outlined by our shadow Minister, puts food on the table straight away. Speakers here tonight have already mentioned the burden which the present scheme places on rural families: the paperwork they have to go through, the tests they have to pass and the criteria they have to meet to get some sort of assistance. Surely the people who are receiving Jobsearch allowance and the like in the cities do not have to go to the trouble the rural families have to go to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue of major concern which has been covered tonight is the assets test. As Senator Boswell said, the poor old farmers end up being assets rich and income poor. A lot of them say to me, `You can't eat dirt'. But they hang on. Unfortunately, in times of drought, the only assistance they are getting from the Government now is through the rural adjustment scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am disappointed that the Government has refused to implement one of the major recommendations of the drought policy review task force concerning incentives for drought proofing. Most of the farmers we spoke to said they wanted to be drought proof and they wanted to be self-sufficient. I do not believe the RAS goes far enough to allow them to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also concerned that the Government has refused to place severe drought back into the Federal-State natural disaster arrangements. Whilst some of the States&mdash;New South Wales and Queensland, in particular&mdash;have been of tremendous assistance during this current drought, other States have not been so generous. Whilst an extra $14m has been allocated to the rural adjustment scheme to compensate for this, the fact remains that there is an annual limit to the rural adjustment scheme's budget and the financial impositions caused by severe drought would far exceed this limit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said at the beginning of my speech, I support this legislation with some reservations. I applaud the Government for moving closer to the coalition's policy. However, after further consideration of the problems faced by rural producers, a coalition government will make further amendments to this legislation in particular, placing severe drought back into Federal-State cooperative arrangements. </PARA>

I refer to Senator Boswell's speech. Not only was it eloquent, but also it was to the point. Senator Boswell spoke about the real hardship and suffering&mdash;and I do not use those words lightly&mdash;of the people of rural Australia who not only have been deprived by an act of God of an opportunity of making a go, but also have been deprived by high interest rates, by an economic recession and, in many cases, by bureaucracy of having a chance of staying on their farms.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is appropriate that we understand what this determination says. The question is: when is this subsidy to be included in the assessable income of the recipient? The answer is: in the income year in which it is received. In other words, people are getting a government subsidy on a loan because they cannot make ends meet and there is no way they can possibly stay on the farm without it. Yet, under this Government they will be made to pay tax on it, for goodness sake! They are having enough trouble staying on the farm as it is. I am sure that there must be some oversight. I do not believe that a humane government could possibly give people a grant with one hand and tax it with the other when the purpose of the grant is to help them stay alive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would suggest that the Government look at this matter tonight because it is fairly important. Senator McMullan is the relevant parliamentary secretary in the area of taxation matters. I would beg and plead with Senator McMullan that, if at all possible, this legislation be amended so that the amounts of money given by way of rural adjustment are not treated as assessable income for the purposes of income tax. If this tax ruling applies to canegrowers, it will apply as well to other farmers who get assistance under the rural adjustment scheme and that frightens me immensely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be that some of those farmers will still have a loss at the end of the year and therefore will not pay any tax. But there may be some farmers who will just break even or make a very slight loss and who would probably fall into the category of people eligible to receive rural adjustment. Therefore, they will have to pay tax on the value of the interest subsidy that they have received from the Federal Government. That seems to be wholly unfair, wholly unjust and wholly unproductive. If the Government really intends to give $160m of assistance then it should say so. But if the Government does not intend to give $160m of assistance, if it intends to claw $10m, $20m or $30m back, then I believe it should say so as well so that everybody understands exactly how much money is available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The absurd thing about this ruling is that it is based on a 1937 tax case from the United Kingdom in respect of subsidies paid to sugar beet growers in the UK in 1937 under the British Sugar Subsidy Act of 1925. There is enormous difference between that Act and what we are doing tonight. Under the British Sugar Subsidy Act of 1925 a long term subsidy was provided irrespective of the circumstances of the farmers in question. It was just like the common agricultural policy of today. It would be appropriate for the money to be taxed if we had such a subsidy scheme. But this is money that we are giving by way of a humanitarian assistance to farmers who cannot otherwise survive. I do not believe that one can draw any analogies between the two at all. In fact, I think that sort of logic is wholly flawed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would normally make some other comments in relation to IEDs. There has been an improvement but it does not go far enough; it certainly does not go as far as the National Party and the Liberal Party would go were we in government. I know that some of my colleagues have spoken about that tonight. I do not want to detain the Senate unnecessarily but I would seek some indication from Senator McMullan tonight as to whether the Government will amend this legislation so that the subsidies are not eligible for taxation. I do not know whether Senator McMullan has heard a word of what I have said about this matter this evening.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the senators who spoke are people with significant experience in rural matters, and it showed in their contributions. I do not necessarily share all the views that they expressed but they made substantial contributions to the debate. I do not wish to be provocative so I will just say generally that that does not apply to every contribution that was made. Others can make their judgments about those to whom I think it did not apply; but there were a number of weighty and worthwhile contributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a package of Bills which will do much to strengthen the performance and resilience of Australia's rural communities.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Tambling queried the administration of the FHS by the Department of Social Security. Some other speakers thought that actually was a good idea, and I share that view. It is appropriate to the character of the program, the nature of DSS's services these days, the distribution of DSS officers and the professional skills of the people in those programs. It will prove to be a worthwhile change. That is a view that I think is shared by many of the senators who spoke. History will be the judge, but I think it will turn out to be a plus. It seems on the face of it to be an appropriate change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Boswell queried the appropriateness of the Budget allocation for 1992-93 when compared with last year's expenditure. I point out to him that the FHS and the re-establishment grant components of the package are claims based. I am advised that the actual expenditure on these items can go beyond that Budget figure. Further, the RAS budget is subject to a mid-year review concerning the adequacy of the funds made available. So there is more room there than perhaps Senator Boswell first recognised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make it clear to Senator Boswell that farmers do not have to commit themselves to sell the farm to get the FHS support from the first nine months of the payment through to the full two years. That is not required. It seemed to be implied in something Senator Boswell said. Perhaps he thought that was so, but we make it clear that it is not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are now not going on to the committee stage, so I do not want to spend a considerable amount of time considering the amendments. We are not disposed to agree with those of which we are aware. At the very least we would say that they are not necessary. With regard to the other amendments, it is a little late in the day to be proposing such a range of amendments, and we are not disposed to support them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a lot of consideration about the loan nature of the FHS in comparison to the Jobsearch allowance. I do not think it is an entirely appropriate analogy. I understand the way in which people raise it, but FHS is not intended to replace or equate with the Jobsearch allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is not a reasonable comparison to suggest that farmers who are in difficulty are in the same position as urban employees who find themselves without a job. They have some common problems and they face some common difficulties, but the situations are quite different. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This situation is probably more analogous to a struggling small business person, whether rural or urban. When we think about that comparison, we see that the farm household support is not perhaps appropriately compared with the Jobsearch allowance and is not inappropriately structured. It is for people to have their views about how generous it should be, but to make the comparison with Jobsearch allowance is not, I think, appropriate, nor does it really enhance the debate or lead to and assist in an informed analysis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The FHS scheme also provides farmers who believe in their future with an opportunity to ride out the recession, even if their banks will not provide further loans. The farm is not required to be offered for sale. The farmers and their families alone decide their future. If they take the difficult decision to leave, a package of up to $55,000 per farmer is available to assist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator O'Chee raised, in an impassioned way, a matter to do with a tax ruling. All I can do at the moment is undertake to look into that and see whether the concerns which he raised are valid. On the face of it, there did not seem to me to be a serious problem, but I am not across all the issues to do with the ruling, of course, and I do not know all the circumstances of the individuals who might be affected. They would be very complex. But as I understand it, most interest subsidies are paid directly to the financial institution and, therefore, the interest cost charged to the farmer is after the  interest  subsidy.  If  the</PARA>
<PARA>subsidy is paid to the farmer, it is included in his or her income, but of course it is then likely to be deductible, I would have thought, as an interest cost to such individuals in the normal course of earning their income under section 51 of the Income Tax Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the face of it there does not seem to be a problem, but I understand there is a range of different circumstances that might be involved. It is not a ruling with which I am personally familiar; I just heard Senator O'Chee's outline of it. I will take that up with the Tax Commissioner and, if there are more factors which need to be reported, I will either advise Senator O'Chee directly, or, if it is of more general concern, I will advise the Senate.

<PARA>The coalition's amendments seek to set up the Australian Health Ethics Committee, the AHEC, as a body separate from the National Health and Medical Research Council. The AHEC would be established by the Minister and its functions would be advising, making recommendations and formulating guidelines and ethical issues relating to health, formulating guidelines for the conduct of medical research involving humans, conferring with State Attorneys-General during the formulation of guidelines and such other functions as the Minister determines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition amendments will also ensure that membership of the AHEC constitutes members of certain specified professions and areas of professional interest that are relevant to the Committee's functions. Our amendments will ensure that the appointment of members to the AHEC is undertaken in consultation with the Australian Health Ministers Conference and relevant professional bodies. Most importantly, the coalition amendments seek to ensure the separation of the AHEC and the NHMRC by providing that no member of the NHMRC or of a principal committee of the NHMRC is eligible for appointment to the AHEC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition amendments also require that any guidelines formulated by the AHEC can be effectively scrutinised by the Parliament by way of tabling and amendment. Our amendments set out the ground rules for the conduct of the independent AHEC, including meetings, voting procedures, resolutions, record keeping, the disclosure of pecuniary interests, terms of office of members, staff, and the engagement of consultants. The amendments will also ensure that the AHEC must furnish an annual report, which must be tabled by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the coalition amendments seek to ensure that the current National Health and Medical Research Council statement on human experimentation and supplementary notes, which will be the current guidelines on medical research involving humans, will be reissued within six months of the date of proclamation. Under our amendments, these reissued guidelines must also be tabled and would be amendable by the Parliament. Both the Australian Federation of Right to Life Associations and the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference have expressed concern that there is a conflict of interest in having an ethics committee as part of a body whose major function it is to promote medical research. Both these organisations have called on the AHEC to be established as a separate statutory authority and for its guidelines to be subject to the scrutiny of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Select Committee on the Human Embryo Experimentation Bill 1985, which was chaired by Senator Tate, also supported the establishment of such a body as a statutory authority. In view of the continual developments in bio-medicine, the coalition contends that it is eminently sensible that the AHEC and the NHMRC remain separate. We believe it is imperative that the objective ethical review of medical research and clinical practice is ensured. We believe that the conflict of interests can neither be allowed to occur, nor be seen to be allowed to occur, in regard to the NHMRC's research and community functions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The National Health and Medical Research Council Bill 1992 is to establish the National Health and Medical Research Council as a statutory body. Since 1936 until now, that body has had its existence by virtue of an Order in Council decision. Considerable concern has been expressed over a number of years that the body which promotes medical research is the same body which establishes the ethical guidelines which should govern that research. That is a conflict of interests. It is one which should not have been allowed to continue, yet the Government has allowed it to continue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Following the report and recommendations of the Senate Select Committee on Human Embryo Experimentation, the Government came up with a response which, as history has proved, was found to be totally inadequate. The Government's response was not to agree to the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee. Actually, that Select Committee recommended, inter alia, that there be a legislative principle which would, amongst other things, render unlawful any destructive non-therapeutic experiments on human embryos. The Committee also recommended the establishment of a separate national body which would not be associated with any other body, but which would be able to deal with the ethical questions involved and which would also be able to license particular institutions for the purposes of research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government established an organisation which had no real statutory force. That was the NBCC, the National Bioethics Consultative Committee. The claim to fame of the Committee was the surrogacy report, which was roundly condemned throughout the whole of the nation. Indeed, the Australian Health Ministers Conference rejected the recommendation of that committee on surrogacy. So, for one reason or another, it became untenable for the Government to continue with that Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that we have finally reached a stage where the Government, the Opposition and the Australian Democrats all concede that the situation should not continue where the body which promotes medical research is the same body which establishes the ethical guidelines governing that research. The difference between the Government and the Opposition on this particular question is as to accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's proposal&mdash;and I have to deal with it to contrast it to the Opposition's proposal&mdash;is to establish an Australian Health Ethics Committee which will continue to be a principal committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council. The Government seeks to amend clause 35 of the Bill to establish the constitution and appointment of the Australian Health Ethics Committee. The Opposition's amendment also establishes the constitution of the Committee. That is to be found in proposed clause 34E of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is interesting that the Opposition includes in proposed paragraph (m) that on the Committee there is to be a person with an understanding of the concerns of disabled persons. That is something that is missing from the Government's proposal. I am quite surprised that the Democrats will not support this proposal from the Opposition because this is an area which is of great concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Disabled Peoples International, in a submission to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs, made perfectly clear its concern about the way that the National Health and Medical Research Council is treating persons with disabilities. It strongly expressed its view that the proposals that were made by the National Health and Medical Research Council last year in regard to the establishment of registers of persons with genetic disorders were insufficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of honourable senators have read the submission made by Disabled Peoples International, so I will not go deeply into it. Suffice it to say that, echoing the concern that persons with disabilities have, a consultant ethicist, Mr Nicholas Tonti-Filippini, in a submission to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs on this Bill, referred to that guideline established by the National Health and Medical Research Council last year on genetic registers. In his submission he indicated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The information for a genetic register begins to be collected when a family member is referred to the register staff for diagnosis, genetic counselling, predictive testing or management of the condition. The NH&amp;MRC's guidelines for genetic registers state that the pedigree and health status of family members are to be recorded in so far as they are known by the family member being interviewed. The use of the phrase `pedigree and health status' in a human context is indicative of the level and eugenic direction of the NH&amp;MRC's thinking. Information about family members is to be recorded even though consent has not been obtained from them.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Tonti-Filippini, quite rightly, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This clearly breaches the right to privacy under article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill proposes to continue to have those matters dealt with by a group without accountability to the Parliament. The Opposition is proposing, quite rightly, that these very major guidelines should be the subject of scrutiny by the Parliament because they are affecting future generations as well as existing ones to a very large degree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, the Opposition's amendments require that, in the appointment of the persons referred to in proposed new section 34E, the particular bodies should be consulted. Senator Lees seems to indicate that the only authority that should be consulted is the consumers organisation. Why should not the other bodies be consulted when it comes to the appointment of those persons? For example, I notice that the Opposition's proposal says in paragraph (c), `a person who has expertise in law'. Further, the Opposition says, in proposed section 34F(4)(a), that, before appointing that member, the Minister should `seek nominations from such bodies representing the legal profession as are prescribed for the purpose'. Proposed section 34E(d) refers to `a person who has expertise in philosophy'; and proposed section 34F(4)(b) says the Minister should `seek nominations from such learned academies as are prescribed for the purpose'. Proposed section 34E(e) says `a person who has expertise in religion', and proposed section 34F(4)(c) the Minister should consult with `such peak religious bodies as are prescribed for the purpose'. And so it goes on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. Senator Lees proposes that this be done only so far as the consumer organisation is concerned. Senator Lees seems to be indicating that in respect of the consultation process her proposals are similar, if not identical, to those of the Opposition. I certainly have not seen those so I would be interested to have a look at them. But do Senator Lees' proposals contain a provision for a person with understanding of the concerns of disabled persons? They do not. This is an extremely vital area, one where Disabled Persons International has expressed grave concern. I will deal with the issue of eugenics shortly, because much of the experimentation that is proposed is to do with eugenics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The vital part that is missing, I presume, from the amendments proposed by Senator Lees is that Parliament will have a say. At least at the present moment the National Health and Medical Research Council is responsible to elected representatives. It is now at least responsible to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services; it is not directly responsible to the Parliament. But under this legislation, as proposed by the Government, it will no longer be responsible or answerable in any shape or form to Parliament or any elected representative. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the arguments against the Opposition's amendments were clearly put by Senator Lees. The Government, of course, opposes the amendments.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the way the legislation has been drafted ensures that we strike a balance between, on the one hand, the independence of the ethical view and, on the other, the need not to inhibit research by unnecessary rules. It should be noted that the guidelines of the Australian Health Ethics Committee would be made public and its independence is guaranteed by the structure of the legislation. However, the basic point is that we, as a government, feel that there is merit to ensure that an interlocking network exists between the committees of the NHMRC and, as a consequence, we oppose the Opposition's amendments. </PARA>

In trying to determine that balance, the Government felt that the functions as espoused in the first amendment are of major concern and have attracted an enormous amount of public interest and debate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like a more definitive response from the Minister than the one he has given me thus far. The Government proposes that, of the functions of the Australian Health Ethics Committee, only (b) is a function for which it has total responsibility. The other functions are advisory only to the National Health and Medical Research Council. I make the point again that one of those guidelines, that is, the guideline governing the establishment of genetic registers, was decided upon last year&mdash;1991&mdash;by  the National Health and Medical Research Council. It was decided upon after consideration, after a working party had been established which was principally research driven. Those are the guidelines currently determined and currently on foot. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There is nothing in this legislation that is about to change that. The Minister said in response to me that, yes, the guidelines for the conduct of medical research involving humans would be the subject of complete review and reassessment by the new AHEC. The Minister was referring to the National Health and Medical Research Council statement on human experimentation and supplementary notes, with the exception of supplementary note 4, and we will come to that after dealing with the amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am just seeking information from the Minister on an issue that is of great concern to a number of people as to whether the AHEC will reconsider those guidelines relating to the establishment of registers of persons and families with genetic disorders. I mention to the Minister, so that he is aware of the conflict of interest involved, that a prominent member of the working party which prepared these guidelines is Professor David Danks. In submission No. 1 to the Senate Select Committee on the Human Embryo Experimentation Bill 1985, he declared precisely what he meant by the word `prevention'. By that word he meant the elimination of those tiny humans deemed to have a genetic disorder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a situation develops where registers of persons and families with genetic disorders will be established in Australia, not for the purpose of curing the disorders but for the purpose of eliminating the bearers of those disorders, then I would have thought that that is a major question of public policy and a matter of great concern. That is not to say, of course, that some registers may not be useful in the treatment of diseases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know we are in the committee stage and, therefore, to quote from something would be ruled out of order. However, the thrust of all of this is to establish a situation where disease will be prevented not by curing a disorder but by the elimination of the small bearer of that disorder. I remind the Committee that that is precisely what occurred in pre-war Nazi Germany. A very interesting book by Robert J. Lifton entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Nazi Doctors</EMPHASIS> describes the establishment in Germany in 1934 of registers, card indexes, of persons and families with genetic taints.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I presume that Senator Harradine is talking about genetic registers. I did answer, in essence, that question when he asked the same question earlier this evening. The answer I gave was that it is a matter of balance and some areas are in the research and discussion stage.

I do go back to my basic point, though, that there is a balance.

It would seem to me that this is a very important area of human endeavour. It is right at the edge of the research that is being undertaken. There are great temptations to those working in the field to get excited about being right at the forefront. It is sometimes a bit like being here in Canberra. Being locked away here day in and day out, we may lose sight of what is really going in the outside world. The same applies to those people in research. Sometimes they can get carried away with the moment of their research and lose sight of the overall outcome of what they are doing. It would seem only appropriate that those guidelines be looked at carefully and that people have the opportunity to make known publicly to their elected representatives their concerns about what is most probably the most contentious area of human research, or research of any sort&mdash;other than, most probably, nuclear research. </PARA>

Somebody else said, `I was just working on this area' and the military people said, `I was only working on this area'. Nobody seemed to have overall responsibility. Really, in the area of research it ought to be Parliament which has overall responsibility.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The unique life experiences of people with disabilities provide them with a different perception of reality to that of the  medically dominated and non-disabled profession's consciousness of the NHMRC.</PARA>
<PARA>The coalition believes that the Parliament is the proper authority to weigh up the widely varying and sometimes conflicting viewpoints that will inevitably result when guidelines are issued in relation to the conduct of medical research involving humans and other ethical issues relating to health. Both of these areas, but in particular issues relating to medical experimentation involving humans, are more than likely to be the subject of extensive conjecture and public debate in the future.

<PARA>In other words, this sets in concrete the National Health and Medical Research Council Statement on Human Experimentation and Supplementary Notes 1992. That was the intention of the Bill some weeks ago when the Bill was introduced into the Parliament. Now we have an amendment by the Government which says, `and with the exception of the Supplementary Note 4'. What does that mean? That means that supplementary note 4 relates to in-vitro fertilisation and embryo transfer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the very supplementary note that the Senate Select Committee on the Human Embryo Experimentation Bill 1985 referred to when it said the marker event stated in that supplementary note lacked inherent ethical validity. When I saw clause 89 of that original Bill I decided that if that was going to be set in concrete in legislation, as was proposed, I was going to move an amendment which made it clear that there should be no funding by the National Health and Medical Research Council of any project which involved destructive non-therapeutic experimentation on a human embryo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was the recommendation made by the Senate Select Committee. I indicated that intention in the second reading stage of the debate. Since then there has been a great deal of misinformation supplied to honourable senators by certain people. I would like to refer to some of that misinformation which is largely the result of statements made by Dr Robert Jansen, who is the Medical Director of Sydney IVF Pty Ltd. As a matter of interest, Dr Jansen was the co-author of supplementary note 4 before he left the NHMRC Medical Research Ethics Committee and took up his position with Sydney IVF Pty Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He has been saying a number of things and I will quote something he stated in a circular which was distributed among honourable senators. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Twelve years after the birth of Australia's first IVF babies, the methods for culturing, or growing, human embryos in vitro have not changed much. As a result, success rates with IVF have improved relatively little.</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly that is wrong because overseas the figures for success rates on IVF have improved very little. In the UK there is very little restraint on experimentation on human embryos. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, it is interesting to note that Fiona Stanley, an epidemiologist of very great standing in Australia, conducted a study actually funded by the NHMRC and stated recently on an ABC program that the success rates on IVF are identical to those people who are on the waiting list. That is an interesting comment and people ought to take a bit of notice of it. I am pointing out the inaccuracy of what Dr Jansen said. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Embryo research with objectives approved by independent committees can be ethical up to 14 days from fertilization.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what he said as co-author of the Medical Research Ethics Committee recommendations to the National Health and Medical Research Council which are contained in supplementary note 4. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what he said, but the Senate Select Committee stated that that comment lacked ethical validity. Frankly, it also lacks scientific validity, because when I asked the question, `Why fourteen days?', Professor Lovell&mdash;who was the Chairman of the MREC at the time&mdash;said, `Well, that is about the time when implantation takes place'. I asked him: had he not heard of Hertig and Rock? I suspect that he had not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that stage, Dr Jansen conceded that implantation did commence on the sixth or seventh day. So from a scientific point of view, 14 days is a nonsense. In any event, a human embryo cannot be transferred into a uterus after 14 days. For that matter, a human embryo cannot be successfully transferred into a uterus after about three or four days. So, scientifically, it is a nonsense. What he is saying there ignores what has been said on a number of occasions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other issues I would like to go through on this particular matter, but I presume I will not be permitted to by the Chairman. I ask the Minister why the Government decided to take out supplementary note 4. I think that is a valid question which the Government should answer. Does it also consider, as did the Senate Select Committee, that the marker event therein lacked ethical validity? I would be interested to know the real reason for this decision. Perhaps the real reason may have been somewhat different. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Was any consideration given to the question of whether or not a conscience vote would be allowed to the Opposition? Was that part of the considerations? Some members of the Government are saying&mdash;and I feel for them&mdash;that they do not have a conscience vote with regard to an amendment I am proposing. The reason that they do not have a conscience vote, it is being suggested, is that if supplementary note 4 were to be retained in the legislation, it would cement into legislation the provision which allows for human embryo experimentation up to 14 days. Having pulled that out, the Government is saying to its colleagues that, therefore, there is no conscience vote on the matter because that particular issue does not arise. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the so-called ban commences on 1 July 1993, many of the restrictions contained in the Bill will commence from the beginning of 1996. Any tobacco sponsorship contracts entered into prior to 1 April 1992 will be allowed to continue until 31 December 1995. In the case of cricket matches, this extension will continue until April 1996. Similarly, any contract for a large billboard established prior to April 1992 will remain valid until the end of 1995, although tobacco advertising on smaller signs will be abolished by 1 July 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides for a number of exclusions to the tobacco advertising restrictions. For example, the broadcasting of overseas sporting events from countries where tobacco advertising is permitted is exempt as long as the local broadcaster does not derive financial benefit from the advertising. The labelling of cigarette packets will be allowed to continue. Tobacco manufacturers will be able to continue to use their company letterheads and advertise in publications that are distributed solely within the tobacco industry. Advertising at the point of sale, including advertising on tobacco vending machines, will continue to be permitted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By way of a notice in the Government <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette,</EMPHASIS> the Minister may also authorise the advertising of specified non-tobacco products which have tobacco brand names. Obviously, anti-smoking advertisements which are intended to discourage smoking will be exempt from the ban. Tobacco advertising in imported magazines will also continue to be allowed, although the Minister will have the power to exclude a particular publication if it is considered that this exemption is being abused. Individuals will also be allowed to publish tobacco advertising on their own initiative if they do not receive any benefit from such publication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the Bill permits tobacco advertising in association with certain specified sporting or cultural events. The Minister must deem that such an event is of international significance and that Australia would be unlikely to be able to continue to hold the event if tobacco advertising was not permitted. The Minister may impose conditions on advertising at such events. In imposing these conditions, he or she must pay regard to guidelines under the Act which will be disallowable instruments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any decision made in regard to specified non-tobacco products, imported periodicals and events of international significance will be reviewable by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Decisions in relation to specified non-tobacco products and imported periodicals can be delegated to the Department. However, decisions concerning events of international significance cannot be delegated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the outset, I wish to state that the Opposition supports the legislation. It is irrefutable that cigarette smoking is an unhealthy and addictive habit. The Australian Medical Association estimates that some 20,000 Australians die annually from smoking related diseases and that 450,000 children presently under the age of 14 will die because they smoke. Tobacco is claimed to be the number one cause of preventable death and disease in Australia. As such, it also imposes a huge financial burden on the community, with the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) stating in his second reading speech that tobacco cost the Australian economy over $6.8 billion dollars in 1988. I do not think that anybody in the Senate would disagree with me when I say that any responsible government should do everything within its powers to lower the incidence of tobacco use in the community, both by persuading smokers to give up speaking and by dissuading non-smokers from taking up the habit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To date Government efforts to reduce the incidence of smoking in Australia can be put into five main categories:  first, State and Federal governments of all political persuasions have continued to increase the tax from cigarettes. In the last Budget the current Government increased tobacco excise by 10 per cent. Fightback provides for a 25 per cent increase in tobacco excise. While such tax hikes obviously may dissuade non-smokers and new smokers, their effect on long term smokers is questionable, given the addictive nature of the habit. Governments also remain open to the perennial criticism from citizens that they do not want to reduce tobacco consumption because tobacco is such a lucrative revenue raiser. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, State and Federal governments continue to allocate resources for education and publicity campaigns which have the twin objectives of preventing people taking up cigarette smoking and of weaning addicted smokers off the habit. I include in this category the resources which are used directly to assist individual smokers to kick the habit as well as money which is spent on research into the cigarette smoking phenomenon in our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, there are initiatives which seek to prevent the harmful effects resulting from the inhalation of cigarette smoke being experienced by non-smokers. Most commonly, this entails the banning of smoking in public places. The two major government areas in which such a ban has been imposed are in government buildings and on domestic aeroplanes and in airport terminals. It is also feasible that such initiatives have an indirect affect on the incidence of smoking. They often make smokers feel alienated from mainstream society. The effect of these bans on workplace and industry efficiency is also an important consideration. Recent court decisions on the harmful effects of passive smoking mean that these bans are likely to become more widespread in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, there are prohibitions on the sale of cigarettes to minors. While it is not feasible to ban the sale of cigarettes altogether, it is generally agreed that tobacco should not be readily available to children. This attitude is based on the belief that people at younger ages are more susceptible to peer pressure unless able to make a reasoned and informed decision about a matter which can potentially be very harmful later in life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final category of government initiatives is to stem the incidence of smoking in society. It relates to restrictions on the advertising of tobacco products. This Bill directly relates to this category. In the Minister's words, the Bill establishes a national ban on tobacco advertising. However, I think it is more accurate to describe this Bill as a further restriction on some of the methods of tobacco advertising rather than a total eradication of such advertising. I think we need go no further than the exemptions in this Bill to understand that it is virtually impossible to eradicate tobacco advertising altogether. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some time ago when I was in Hamilton talking to a group of sixth graders, one little boy said to me when they were allowed to ask questions, `Senator, is one of the hardest things in your job making decisions?'. I think that was one of the most profound questions I have been asked while I have been in politics, and it came out of the mouth of a babe. The answer I gave that little boy was that it was probably one of the hardest parts of this job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill is one such example. It is no secret that there was considerable debate on this side of the chamber as to the pros and cons of the Bill. Those people both on this side of the chamber and the other who support the Bill present statistics and medico statements telling us about the harmful effects of cigarette smoking. On the other hand, those who would oppose the Bill because they believe that it is against the principles of free speech and that a company has a fundamental right to advertise to promote a legally available product such as tobacco would take another point of view. Some material that was sent to us provided statistics from a researcher at Monash University which interpreted the data entirely differently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One does not get many belly laughs in this job. I think that when some people send us stuff they think we do not read it, but I assure them that we try to read it as much as possible. I read an article that was sent to us amongst a stack of material called `Politics and ideology of health promotion'. In that article, the author, Petr Skrabanek, a senior lecturer in community health in Trinity College, Dublin, was talking about a similar Bill that was being debated elsewhere. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The hypocritical exercise was described by Matthew Parris&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA>I wonder whether Mr Matthew Parris, in observing the debate on this Bill, would have the same words to say about people with fingers stained with nicotine, bellies hanging over their belts and faces flushed with climbing the stairs, telling other people how they should look after their health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That goes to the essence of the debate that surrounded this Bill. There was considerable debate on this side of the chamber about the pros and cons: on the one hand, the very convincing and very emotive argument about the impact of cigarette smoking, and the impact of advertising, especially on young people taking up cigarette smoking; on the other hand, those who believe that it really is not for us to tell people, especially when it is a legal drug. We have a responsibility as parliamentarians to ensure that everything possible is done to educate young people about the problems associated with cigarette smoking, because that is what actually makes them free&mdash;their being able to choose whether or not they smoke on the evidence rather than on the basis of their not being allowed to see certain advertisements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the pros and cons of the argument, we in the coalition finally reached the decision, with much soul searching, that we would support the Bill, given the fact that we understood all the other arguments that can be put on the other side. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With the introduction of the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Bill we have a further part of the Government's package of reforms aimed at reducing the level of tobacco smoking in the community and, in particular, discouraging  young people from taking up smoking. I am very pleased that the Opposition members in the party room supported this legislation, proving themselves to be more enlightened and concerned with the health of all Australians than their front bench colleagues who in fact opposed it. It seems that, once again, Dr Hewson could see the writing on the wall&mdash;but this time there was actually something worthwhile that he could do about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like other senators, I have received a good deal of lobbying material on this legislation. I would like to deal with some of the issues that have been raised in argument against the Bill. It has been said, and I think it may well be raised in this debate, that it is hypocritical of the Government to legislate in this fashion when we are leaving other substances, such as alcohol, alone. Alcohol has not been left alone. Restrictions have been placed on its advertising, particularly aimed at discouraging young drinkers. It is true that these restrictions are not as rigorous as those on tobacco smoking, and I for one would be favourably disposed to tighter controls, but if we look at the relative situations of alcohol and tobacco it is easy to see that the argument that we should not proceed on tobacco unless we proceed on alcohol at the same time is a meretricious one, and it is intellectually unsustainable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most important factor is that of use as recommended by the manufacturer. The alcohol industry accepts the National Health and Medical Research Council's recommended maximum use of alcohol as the desired standard and it does not press for higher consumption. This recommendation is four drinks a day for men and two drinks a day for women. At this level the NHMRC believes that alcohol is not harmful. In fact there is even some research to suggest that at these levels of consumption alcohol has some beneficial effects on health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that abuse of alcohol is a large problem in our society, but 30 per cent of the community do not drink at all, a further 30 to 50 per cent drink amounts below the NHMRC's recommended maximum levels, and only 10 to 20 per cent of the rest who drink above these levels can be described as chronic abusers of alcohol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problems relating to chronic abusers are severe because, as well as the obvious health problems that result, we also have social problems such as domestic violence and drink driving. Nevertheless&mdash;and I believe these are very interesting figures&mdash;if every man of drinking age had the NHMRC's recommended maximum of four drinks a day and every woman of drinking age had two drinks a day, the alcohol industry would double the amount of alcohol it sells. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tobacco, unlike alcohol, will kill when used as intended by the manufacturer&mdash;that is, when it is smoked in any quantity. In other words, there is no safe level for the usage of tobacco products. This was certainly the finding of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Welfare in 1977 in its report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Drug problems in Australia: an intoxicated society</EMPHASIS>. The Committee, under the chairmanship of former Liberal Senator Peter Baume, recommended a total ban on tobacco advertising. The tobacco industry then launched one of its infamous lobbying campaigns. The result of its success in avoiding an ad ban has been many more years in which death and disease have been spread with impunity in the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the series of legislative changes brought about by this Government&mdash;and with the bipartisan support for this legislation&mdash;I am pleased to say that I think that the tobacco industry's charmed run has come to an end. It has also been said that, as tobacco is a legal substance sold over the counter, it should be treated in the same way as, for example, Mars bars, which are often sold in the same outlets. I will presume, against all the evidence, that those who say this are serious. If they are serious, the best rebuttal of this false analogy is to look at products listed in schedule 3 of the Poisons Act, which lists dangerous substances. This is much more of an apt comparison, as tobacco is also a dangerous substance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 3 includes about 150 items&mdash;everything from wart treatment to insulin to, significantly, nicorette chewing tabs. I use the word `significantly' because nicorettes contain exactly the same poison as tobacco products do&mdash;that is, nicotine&mdash;although, of course, they avoid the dangerous effects of smoking and of many of the known carcinogens in cigarettes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What restrictions are placed on schedule 3 items? They are available over the counter in pharmacies&mdash;that is, from behind the counter and not on display shelves. There is no age restriction on their purchase. They are not allowed to be advertised or promoted to the general public. In other words, they have restrictions placed on them to ensure as far as possible that the material is sold and used in a sensible way and in the way that the manufacturer intended. If used in the proper manner, each of these preparations confers a benefit, a cure or an alleviation of an existing problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, while the Government can legislate to have tobacco products sold and used in a sensible way, as this legislation shows, this excludes the test of manufacturers' intentions of usage because, as I have said&mdash;and it is worth repeating&mdash;there is no level of safe usage. I have mentioned that nicorettes are schedule 3 items. The big difference between nicorettes and tobacco products is that nicorettes were developed after we became aware of the dangers associated with nicotine, one of the most poisonous and addictive substances we know of. They were developed specifically to offer addicted smokers a somewhat less destructive means of feeding their addiction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the patterns of sale and distribution of tobacco products were well established before this time and, therefore, difficult to change too quickly. In fact, our awareness of the problems associated with smoking is relatively recent. We have all seen the war films where the greatest kindness a soldier can do for his dying buddy is to light a fag and stick it between his lips. I think it gives a whole new meaning to the famous phrase `last dying gasp'. The tobacco industry's relentless campaign to recruit young smokers to replace older and wiser smokers who are kicking the habit I think is making it likely that these young people will also end up with the same `last dying gasp'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We as a Government are doing our best to ensure that the tobacco industry's attempted recruitment of new young smokers is unsuccessful. Obviously, it is not an easy battle, not only because of the activities of the tobacco industry but also because of a complex interaction of factors that cause young people to take up smoking. There is peer pressure; there is rebellion against adult values, which is incongruous in itself as it is adults who tend to be pushing these products; and there is the glamour associated with tobacco sponsored sports. In the case of teenage girls, who are taking up smoking in alarming and proportionally greater numbers than boys, I think the strong incentive is the widespread belief that smoking will help girls to stay thin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tobacco industry continues to insist that sports sponsorship and the associated advertising does not attract new smokers but merely changes market shares within the existing market. I think this flies in the face of an overwhelming amount of research done on the subject. I have received recently, as I am sure other senators have, research which indicates a very strong link between tobacco advertising, sport sponsorship and children's smoking behaviour. For example, Professor Stephen Leeder of the Department of Public Health at Sydney University points out that he and his fellow researchers have estimated that tobacco advertising might be responsible for as much as 14 per cent of the uptake of smoking by children. While other peer pressures will continue to operate, there is no doubt that they will be mitigated by the removal of the factors covered by this legislation. We have every reason to hope that this combined with positive education programs such as the current `Smoking. Who Needs It?' campaign will reduce the number of young people taking up smoking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of sporting organisations have lobbied hard against this legislation, claiming that it will virtually mean an end to sport in Australia as we know it. However, they have wandered onto very dangerous grounds, I think, by entering into the health debate at all. I have been sent material which claims that there is no definite, indisputable, beyond doubt causal link between smoking and disease, between cigarette promotion and the level of smoking; that not as many Australians as claimed are dead or diseased because of tobacco smoking. I must say that this really makes me wonder: at what point would the relationship start to worry these organisations? Would it worry them if their sponsor's product was killing Australians at the rate of a hundred a year, a thousand a year, 10,000 a year? At what point do dead and diseased Australians become more important than horses running around a track, footballers kicking the leather or&mdash;it really hurts me to say this&mdash;even the whack of leather against willow on the cricket pitch?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing that was obvious was that both the themes of these letters and the so-called research to back up what they were saying were obviously provided to them by the tobacco industry. The Royal Australasian College of Physicians confirms that `advertising by tobacco companies, including their sponsorship of sporting and cultural events, has been a factor in encouraging the uptake of smoking by young people'. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS> The RACP also points out that the tobacco industry sponsors medical research as part of its strategy to undermine research findings about the health effects of smoking, to foster the illusion that the issue of whether smoking damages health is still a matter for debate, and to enhance its public image. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to point out the hypocrisy of the tobacco industry raising these issues, given the disgraceful treatment of cricketer Greg Matthews, who exercised his right to free speech by appearing in a double page spread entitled, `When you really want to quit' in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Woman's Day</EMPHASIS> of 25 May this year. For this heinous crime Greg Matthews lost three months pay, presumably at the behest of the sponsors, Benson and Hedges. Cricketers' contracts are now being rewritten to prevent this example being followed. Honourable senators could well exercise their minds as to what this sort of action means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I am on the subject of the Australian Cricket Board, I was interested to read a media release put out last year jointly by the British Medical Association and the Australian Medical Association which roundly criticised the ACB for being the only national sporting body in Australia clinging to tobacco sponsorship. They pointed out that all countries in the European Community were set to ban tobacco advertising and sports sponsorship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Roly Bott pointed out that an extensive survey conducted in Western Australia showed that tobacco sponsorship of sporting events was seen by children as a personal endorsement of smoking by the athletes involved&mdash;the very same athletes who are role models for young people at the most vulnerable age as far as smoking is concerned. Dr Ian Field of the BMA said that a UK survey had found that 64 per cent of children aged 15 and 16 believed that cigarettes were advertised on television. In fact, tobacco products have not been advertised on television in the United Kingdom since the 1960s, which shows clearly that children do not differentiate between advertisements and a telecast of tobacco sponsored events. It also shows the necessity for us to plug all the loopholes to prevent the tobacco companies just moving the circus to a new venue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is to be hoped that the progressive legislation which has been introduced by this Government will provide a role model to help other countries avoid the mistakes that we have made and to spare them the huge price in terms of medical and other costs associated with smoking related illnesses, given that tobacco companies are responding to an overall decline in tobacco consumption in this country by now focusing their activities in the Asia-Pacific region. If this legislation denies to tobacco companies the absolute right to commercial free speech that they desire, it does not deny to individuals the right to kill themselves, to destroy their health with tobacco products or to add to national health costs. It merely closes off some of the means used by the tobacco companies to entice them to do so. That, of course, is the right of any government which has to pick up the pieces.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will go back only as far as 1981 and begin with a question without notice asked by Senator Chipp of a Minister concerning the advertising of cigarettes. In those days, it seemed that the problem related to the misuse of the terms `mild' and `extra mild'. The tobacco companies were mislabelling products and trying to con people into believing that they were smoking a mild variety when there was no such thing. The findings of the report basically said that many smokers who believe that they are smoking low tar cigarettes are not doing so. Action was promised but, as we see from further reading, that was basically an agreement with the tobacco companies, on consultation with them, and that agreement well and truly broke down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 21 April 1983, a notice of motion was put forward by Senator Mason relating to the relationship between health costs and the smoking of tobacco products. He argued that user pays principles should be instituted by which manufacturers, sellers and users of substances which can be demonstrated to increase the costs of health care to the community should contribute substantially towards those costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 6 September 1983, a private member's Bill was introduced by Senator Jack Evans entitled the Australian Capital Territory Smoking and Tobacco Products Advertisements Prohibition Bill 1983. Senator Jack Evans said this about the basic purpose of the Bill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I propose this Bill as the Australian Democrats spokesperson for sport and recreation. I do so in an effort to protect the children of Australia and to prevent debasement of sport and recreation. After many years of active involvement with sporting organisations I am appalled at the way tobacco companies use sport as a means of enticing young Australians into tobacco addiction. This Bill is intended to protect young Australians from the influences which encourage them to begin smoking tobacco. It is a tragedy that young Australians are being subjected to such pressures. It is even worse when activities such as sport and recreation are abused by using them as vehicles for luring our young Australians into addiction. The Government currently spends millions of dollars on curative medicine relating to diseases and ailments associated with the use of tobacco products. Preventive action can ease the cost and burden which society has to bear resulting from the use of tobacco products. This Bill is a small step towards lifting that burden.</PARA>
<PARA>On 15 September 1983, Senator Jack Evans continued his pursuit of the issue with a question on cigarette advertisements. Part of his question stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Will Senator Grimes ask the Minister for Health to convey to the States' Ministers for Health a proposal that all States and the Commonwealth Government should now legislate to oblige tobacco advertisers to draw the public's attention in all their advertisements to the harmful effects of their product?</PARA>
<PARA>Again, the reason for emphasising this was that the voluntary code had broken down. The Minister's answer noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I know that it was a recommendation to the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare and is a recommendation of most knowledgeable authorities in the area that there should be a ban on the advertising of cigarette products in the written media as well as the electronic media, where a ban already exists at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA>I remind the Senate that we are going back to 15 September 1983 when the problems were well recognised. In March 1984, Senator Jack Evans asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health a further question relating to the fact that the voluntary code had broken down. The Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . clearly contrary to the voluntary code . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is a problem that we are just finally coming to terms with. I turn to a question without notice asked by Senator Jack Evans relating to the advertising of tobacco products to children under the age of 16 years. The Minister's answer in part was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it would not be possible to prevent children under 16 obtaining access to otherwise permitted advertising.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1977 Senator Baume&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is former Senator Peter Baume&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and I and others suggested that we should ban all tobacco advertising. No government has been willing to take up that recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA>On 14 October 1986, Senator Vigor gave notice of his intention to move amendments to a tax Bill to make tax deductions for tobacco promotion not allowable as a business expense. When Senator Vigor went on to move these amendments, he said that he was looking at the goal of reducing smoking by young people. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another means of achieving our goal is to put tobacco virtually out of the economic reach of youngsters . . . if the cost of promotion goes on to the tobacco, we will raise the price of this commodity and, hopefully, put it out of the reach of youngsters. We know that more than 80 per cent of those who smoke become addicted before they are 20. This is the key age group on which we must concentrate&mdash;the teenage years. The pedlars of tobacco know that so they deliberately target their promotional and advertising strategies to hook the young because they are victims for life.</PARA>
<PARA>All of the facts are well known. When the vote was taken on those amendments the Democrats lost, but I do note that Senator Harradine joined us against the rest of the chamber. On 4 December 1986, Senator Vigor proposed amendments to remove tax deductibility from advertising of tobacco products, but again those amendments were not passed. On 4 December 1986 Senator Mason asked a question without notice:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is the Government aware of an article in the October issue of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Nature</EMPHASIS> stating that smoking is estimated to cause 30 per cent of all cancers, that in Norway a national anti-smoking campaign involving banning cigarette advertisements resulted in fewer people taking up smoking, and that a general approach to the treatment of cancer ought to be preventive in view of the increasing indictment of smoking as a major cancer hazard? When will the Government ban all advertising of tobacco, prohibit smoking in aircraft and other public places, and ensure that tobacco products are taxed at levels which compensate for the enormous sums in health care costs they cause to the community?</PARA>
<PARA>I note that we have at last seen the ban of smoking in aircraft. Petitions were lodged to support Senator Jack Evans's Bill, which I mentioned earlier, and yet further petitions were lodged, this time by Senator Sanders. Unfortunately, that Bill was not successful. But on 7 May 1987 Senator Mason introduced a private member's Bill entitled the Air Navigation (Smoking) Amendment Bill. In his speech he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think it is very plain to everybody that there is no proper separation between the non-smoking and the smoking areas of aircraft. There is absolutely no protection to enable people in the non-smoking zones to get away from smoke.</PARA>
<PARA>Later he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is important to examine the reasons why nothing is done about smoking.</PARA>
<PARA>He gave two reasons:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first is the pressure of the tobacco lobby on members of parliament; the other is the pressure of the tobacco lobby on the media, which carries a very heavy responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA>On 14 May 1987, Senator Sanders, in support of the Olympic Insignia Protection Bill 1986, moved amendments which were basically aimed at precluding the insignia and other Olympic designs being used in a context where they may be associated with the promotion of tobacco or, indeed, of alcohol consumption. Unfortunately, when he moved these amendments on 14 May they were lost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 9 October 1987 Senator Coulter, in a question without notice, raised this issue.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1981-82 the Medical Journal of Australia estimated that the direct dollar costs of smoking and the ill health and deaths associated with it were roughly $1 billion per year&mdash;about $400m in the cost of hospital beds and care, $250m associated with deaths and about $350m in social costs related to lost wages and lost productivity. It is worth making the point that those costs have almost certainly risen at least 50 per cent to 100 per cent by now.</PARA>
<PARA>In August 1988 Senator Jenkins asked a series of questions on notice. Again, in 1988 Senator Macklin asked further questions related to smoking. Later Senator Macklin presented a notice of motion concerning smoking in Parliament House. Very briefly, it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . requests the Presiding Officers to&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) prohibit smoking in confined working and public places in this new Parliament House;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) enforce the provision of non-smoking areas in all recreational, retail, restaurant and working areas not covered by (a) above;</PARA>
<PARA>I note that at least some of that has been picked up by us in 1992. On 2 March 1989, Senator Macklin spoke on the Regulation of Video Material Bill 1988 and on 31 May 1989 he presented a notice of motion. The final part reads:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) calls on the Government to adopt the recommendation of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority that the Commonwealth Government ban all advertising of tobacco products on radio, television, in cinemas and in print so far as it is within its constitutional power to do so'.</PARA>
<PARA>On 31 August 1989, Senator Powell introduced the Smoking and Tobacco Products Advertisements (Prohibition) Bill 1989. Many petitions were received in support of this Bill over the ensuing months. This private member's Bill was passed in December 1989 with Government, not Liberal, support unfortunately. Senator Powell, in her second reading speech, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effect of the Smoking and Tobacco Products Advertisements (Prohibition) Bill 1989 will be to end cigarette advertising in the print media.</PARA>
<PARA>Of the surveys which had been conducted, she stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Morgan poll of 2,251 Victorians in October/November 1988 showed 63.7% approval, 28.9% disapproval and 7.4% do not know, on the question of an advertising ban.</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, there was already widespread community support. I now move to amendments to the Broadcasting Amendment Bill 1990 and the Broadcasting Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990 which were moved by Senator Powell and which highlighted the problem that we are now dealing with. Senator Powell said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments which I will introduce relate to the deficiency in the Act which we believe the loophole allowing incidental advertising on broadcast media of tobacco products represents. We wish to close that loophole.</PARA>
<PARA>These amendments were not successful when they were finally dealt with in December of that year. I move on to look at further amendments. These were again moved by Senator Powell and were aimed at closing the loophole through other legislation. There were amendments to the tax legislation by Senator Spindler, which tried to get at tax deductibility for the advertising of tobacco products. But again these were defeated by the combined vote of the Opposition and the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were now a large number of petitions being put forward in support of the actual closing of that loophole. I have sheet after sheet of them here, including those submitted by Senator Powell, Senator Bourne and Senator Bell. Senator Bell put down a notice of motion in April 1991. This again related to advertising which associates sporting events with cigarette brand names and cigarette company names. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were further petitions calling for a ban on incidental advertising. This time one of them was presented by Senator Kernot. There were further notices of motion, again calling for government action on this problem of incidental advertising. There were further speeches from Senator Bell and a notice of motion from Senator Sowada relating to rugby league and tobacco sponsorship of that particular sport. I go on to Senator Kernot's efforts to move the amendments restricting tax deductibility for advertising. She basically said that the Australian Democrats believe that this is very bad public policy and that no tobacco advertising expenditure should qualify for an income tax deduction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move on to another series of notices of motion and efforts by Democrat senators to bring us to the point we are at tonight. We are finally dealing with what is hopefully the last loophole; whether or not it is the last loophole I guess we will only see in time. But hopefully what we are doing tonight will close that last loophole with a couple of exemptions. The first exemption is for international sporting events of national significance, which does cause us some concern. We hope that the two Australian events likely to be affected by this can find alternative means of sponsorship very quickly. Then there is the question of magazines coming in from overseas. This area perhaps offers the greatest potential to be the next loophole that we have to close. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I wish to finish on a positive note by congratulating the Government on finally taking note of all of the pressure put on it over the years. We certainly support this Bill. </PARA>

There were very strongly held views on both sides. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I thought it was unfortunate&mdash;but not surprising&mdash;that Senator Faulkner should try to score what I thought was a very cheap point and fire a very cheap shot by saying that somehow the Opposition front bench had a differing view from that of the back bench when indeed the discussions and the debates, both on the front bench and the back bench, were fought from both sides of the argument with deep conviction. I know that is the case federally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government resisted for years and years the Democrats' private member's Bill when it came to banning advertising.

I know that Senator Herron was going to support it, along with a number of other Liberals. So I thought it was silly of Senator Faulkner to make those comments when his own Ministers had refused to act on this over so many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think there is a single person in politics, indeed a single person in Australia, who would seek to encourage children to smoke. I am perhaps naive, but I do not think that even executives of tobacco companies would like to see children smoke, even though people who are opposed to the tobacco industry as an industry would have one believe that these nasty tobacco executives go around trying to encourage young people to smoke. Indeed, on the surface it may seem that it is in their own best interests to do that but I personally do not believe that is so. Perhaps I am naive and foolish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, I do not enjoy the self-righteousness which people who support the banning of all advertising bring to the argument.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been a long haul. I acknowledge Senator Lees's contribution on behalf of the Australian Democrats to that long haul. This is the third piece of legislation in this Parliament in two decades. In 1973 legislation began the phase-out, finishing in 1976, of electronic broadcasting of direct advertising. Then there was my own private member's Bill some 13 years later, the last piece of legislation to pass the Parliament before the 1990 election, which banned print advertising of tobacco products, something which they said could not be done by the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth was said not to be able to legislate over the print media when print ownership takeovers were taking place and so on. Nevertheless this Parliament was enlightened enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the end, we took a cross-partisan approach to pass that legislation, which banned print advertising. A great many other initiatives have been taken along the way, but not requiring Federal legislation. One that I approved of a great deal in terms of my own personal comfort was the ban on smoking in aircraft. I welcome the extension of that ban to various international flights as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to spend most of my time talking about the process that has led up to this legislation and what it represents. I know something about it, having been responsible for the passage of a fairly large slice of the legislation leading up to this particular Bill and having supported the process which has taken place since. This piece of legislation&mdash;and the private member's Bill banning print advertising for which I was responsible&mdash;is an excellent example of the way the community can win out over an extraordinarily powerful commercial lobby. The community has won out in this case because of cooperation, well organised effort, persistence and patience. Nevertheless, it has won out. This is a very important message in a whole lot of areas where quite often individuals and groups in the community feel that their efforts will not be rewarded and are inclined to give up. My comments are designed to encourage these people not to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators who have contributed to the debate have referred to the intense lobbying which they personally have received. While this legislation has been in gestation I have heard people quote from documentation that has been sent to them by the tobacco companies. I have received none of that. It has been at least five years since the tobacco companies gave me a hard time, because they knew very well that it was a waste of their time. I was never rude to them. Just before my own Bill was passed, they sent a token delegation, not even of their heaviest heavies. I know that that lobbying has continued with other people. One of the most encouraging things about this piece of legislation is that it has finally not succeeded on politicians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay tribute to those community groups who have had the patience and persistence to make this achievement successful&mdash;groups such as the action on smoking and health and the Australian anti-smokers movement. In particular, I wish to refer to one individual, Stephen Woodward, who needs to be acknowledged at this point in the debate since this may be the last major hurdle that he thinks he has to jump. Wherever he jumps, that issue is bound to be successful in the end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The various health organisations around this country&mdash;the anti-cancer councils, the National Heart Foundation, the Australian Medical Association, the Doctors Reform Society and various other medical organisations&mdash;have been very active in putting forward the facts, the figures and the data and encouraging politicians across party lines to see the light and to support this kind of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">State governments have played a role. My own State of Victoria and the State of South Australia should be mentioned as pioneers in the sort of enlightened legislation that has been coming forward over the past decade or so and which pretty well culminates in the chamber tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to pay tribute tonight to the many people in the sporting world who have encouraged this Government to go ahead with a piece of legislation that has been politically sensitive. Following the ban on print advertising at the end of 1989, the next step was definitely the question of sporting and major cultural sponsorships, but in particular sporting sponsorships. My attempts, which Senator Lees referred to, to close the sports sponsorship loophole provided by the incidental advertising provision in the Broadcasting Act were time and again unsuccessful. My final thrust there was, in fact, another private member's Bill. After unsuccessfully moving some amendments, I put them in a form of a private member's Bill which was introduced at the end of 1990. That was done in order to keep that issue on the Notice Paper. As a matter of fact, it is probably still there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It really was then down to those people who wished to pursue it to address the question of what would happen to the major and minor sports in this country. My regret is that it has taken so long, because for every delay, the ante has been raised by tobacco companies. It was always my fear that the political will would not be found. I have known all along that there have been people in the Government, and indeed in the Opposition&mdash;although here I feel the ghost of former Senator Peter Baume in this chamber tonight and I can imagine his delight at the passage of this legislation&mdash;continuing to work on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that Minister Staples and people in his office also deserve to be commended for their persistence, for their sensitivity and for the consultative process for which they have been responsible. I have been willing&mdash;and sometimes able&mdash;to assist them in that process, sometimes simply by pulling in my horns. That can often be important in the political process when it is at a sensitive stage. I am not unwilling to do that if it is going to help the <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">issue in the end.

Nevertheless, she was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That survey showed that the preferences of young children aged between 12 and 14 in the various States who were smoking coincided strikingly with the main brands sponsoring the main football codes in their various States. In many debates in this place I have put that information on the table and I know that all Government Ministers have been lobbying on the basis of those surveys for a good many years. Nevertheless, finally, a very significant Minister, with children of her own, was persuaded by this information. I am very grateful that it did persuade her. </PARA>

As I say, I regret that this has taken so long. The ante has been raised and that is really, in part, the reason why that Benson and Hedges sponsorship will last until April 1996. Various other phase-outs will last until 1995, and it is really only the smaller billboards which will go as early as 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate all of those who have been responsible.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of imported publications&mdash;a loophole in my private member's Bill&mdash;there is ministerial discretion. I believe it has been a sensible way to approach that problem.

I doubt it because I did not, as I think is publicly known, get such support in the Caucus meeting when this matter was being discussed. I was very heavily outnumbered and I did give the commitment to the Caucus that, while I would be expressing a view on this Bill, if it came to a vote on the floor of the chamber I would support it. I have expressed some of my doubts on the effectiveness of the legislation, and I will continue on that tack. If we as a government were really serious about stopping young people taking up this awful habit&mdash;and I can say that with authority because I am a heavy smoker&mdash;we would take decisive action against it. We would act to ban the product: we would ban the importation; we would ban the distribution and we would ban the sale of this particular noxious product. I have no argument about the statistics which are put around which say that 18,000, 19,000 or 20,000 people per year die because they have engaged in this habit. I do believe and accept those figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish that the researchers would delve a bit deeper and look at some of the industry gases and fumes that those smokers may have inhaled in their occupations. I suppose when I kick the bucket I will become another smoking statistic, but during my time in industry before entering this place I was exposed to a number of products which would not necessarily be tested by the researchers who do post-mortems. We do not see too many of those statistics around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The governments&mdash;plural, because I am referring to the State governments as well&mdash;have vested interests in this. That is the reason why they will stand by and allow some 20,000 individuals to die per year, or allow 200,000 young people to continue with this habit. That vested interest is in the region of $3 billion per year&mdash;the revenue raised in taxes and excise from smokers. In the recent Budget, our own Government increased tobacco excise by some 10 per cent. The money raised went into job creation programs for the unemployed. I can say that I am making a real contribution to them, because I have continued with the same level of smoking that I was at before the increase came to bear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a number of other concerns about what will happen when cigarette and tobacco sponsorship of sport is ceased. I draw the Senate's attention to an article which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on the second of this month by Matthew Doman. It was titled `Tips on filtering out the smokers'. He referred to a recent paper by an economist, Terry Alchin, from the University of Western Sydney, who examined cigarette smoking from the early 1960s into the 1990s. Advertising expenditure and cigarette prices were compared with total and per adult consumption. The result of Mr Alchin's study found that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . advertising expenditure does not statistically significantly affect the demand for cigarettes, while. . . cigarette price [is] significant.</PARA>
<PARA>Statistics have been given to me by various lobby groups, including my friend Stephen Woodward, whom I will have a word to say about in a few minutes. He has given me a graph which shows that consumption of tobacco products is declining. I would like to measure increases in taxes and in excise and compare them with that graph which shows that consumption is reducing. I would also like to compare it with the various pieces of legislation that governments have passed, and see which had the most effect&mdash;the price increases or the advertising bans or other government actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Powell in her recent contribution mentioned the survey which proved&mdash;and certainly helped to convince the Minister for Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly)&mdash;that various sporting sponsorships in different States proved that there was a direct nexus, a direct link, between the consumption of Peter Jackson in one State and the consumption of Winfield in another. That survey is from 1984 figures. It is not pertinent to the young people of today, because they are not smoking those brands of cigarettes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are certainly not smoking them where I live in Western Australia. My stepchildren are not into those brands. The brands that they are smoking are not the brands that are being advertised through tobacco sporting sponsorship at the moment. They are not those brands at all. They are smoking the cigarettes in the larger packets which the tobacco producers have brought out to make smoking cheaper. Price is a very significant factor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> However, I have a very great and serious concern which, as Senator Faulkner mentioned earlier, is the link with another poisonous substance which abounds in our community. I quote from the statement on tobacco and tobacco-related products which I received from the Royal Australasian College of Physicians. Item 4 of the rationale in support of this particular legislation reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Seventy-five percent of drug-caused deaths are due to tobacco&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I do not dispute that&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">23% are due to alcohol (including road crash fatalities). . . </PARA>
<PARA>Matthew Doman in his article, which I mentioned and quoted from earlier, goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this is the case, further increases in tobacco taxes would provide a greater discouragement to smokers, and improve the health of Australians and the balance of State and federal budgets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Meanwhile, the brewers, pushers of that other at times dramatically unhealthy habit, stand in line to pick up the high-profile sports sponsorships soon to be forcibly vacated by tobacco companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The virtual absence of advertising and sponsorship restrictions on alcohol companies, and the lack of health warnings on their products, results in an extremely uneven playing field in the marketing of bad habits.</PARA>
<PARA>That is of concern to me. If the Ministers and their advisers are encouraged to believe that tobacco sporting sponsorship encourages young people to get into that obnoxious habit, then alcohol sponsorship will do the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Faulkner in his contribution mentioned that great sportsman Greg Matthews, who recently came to Western Australia and played a tremendous game of cricket against us and beat us&mdash;he was not playing yesterday. Greg Matthews had made the headlines&mdash;and Senator Faulkner referred to it&mdash;when he was fined by the Australian Cricket Board because he had appeared in a `Quit' advertisement. He was fined three months salary&mdash;salary which I understand was paid for by the sponsor of the Australian Cricket Board, the Benson and Hedges company. Because of that, Greg Matthews got a bit of publicity. He came over to Western Australia and was photographed by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper&mdash;and I will not hold up this page of the newspaper because I know from a ruling given the other day that that would be disorderly, but it is here for anyone to see. Greg Matthews appeared in a photograph in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper with his captain, Mark Taylor, wearing a t-shirt which had `Resch's real beer' on the front; his cap also featured Resch's. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it holds true that sporting personalities being sponsored by tobacco companies will encourage young people to get into the habit of smoking, I hold that the corollary is that the same argument can be used for alcohol. If we are to enact this legislation, which we are undoubtedly going to do some time this morning, we should enact similar legislation for alcohol. I believe&mdash;and we know this from personal experience&mdash;that alcohol is perhaps in the short term a greater danger than tobacco for young people growing up in our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said that I would mention a few words about my friend who has been to see me a few times on this legislation: Mr Stephen D. Woodward from the Public Affairs Committee of the Australasian Cancer Society. I think Mr Woodward particularly should be here this morning to see the passage of this legislation because of the way he has progressed it. I commend him for the work that he has done over the years and for the agony which some of his successful actions have put me through. Stephen has thrown out a challenge to me in recent discussions in that next year on Quit Day he will attempt to get me to participate in that. I certainly wish him well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One final matter I want to address is a fear of what some individuals will do with legislation such as this. Earlier this year a decision was taken to ban smoking in airport terminals. It was announced that the ban would come into effect from 1 July. Indeed, the signs went up and the ban did come into effect on 1 July. However, the regulations for that ban did not give authority to the ban until about 17 July. It concerns me that bureaucrats or individuals in government instrumentalities can take action when they do not have the power in law to do so. </PARA>

At the Australian Airlines terminal at Sydney Airport, that ban has been taken outside the terminal building. We now have signs on the pavement outside the building stating that smoking is banned between the signs. I do not know whether they are going to fine people who smoke in those areas. I will probably be one of the first people that they do fine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Melbourne Airport, at the Ansett terminal, there is an alcove area where people enter and leave. Signs there say `No smoking'. That area is not in the air-conditioned part of the building but outside. I am sure that most honourable senators know Melbourne Airport well. They would know that the winds provide a filter so that smoke does not get into the building. I believe that some people are taking the ban too far. I am directly challenging that ban at Melbourne Airport. Whenever I get to Sydney Airport&mdash;I try to avoid that place, but not because Greg Matthews comes from there&mdash;I will also challenge the ban outside the terminal building. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do have doubts about the impact of the Bill. If the Government were really serious about stopping young people&mdash;I agree with stopping young people from smoking&mdash;it would completely ban the production, distribution and the sale of cigarettes. I sincerely hope that we are successful with this legislation. Smoking is an obnoxious and very addictive habit. I am told it is harder to give up than heroin. I know it is hard to give up, but I have never tried heroin. I thank the Senate for its indulgence this morning. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And moderate pieces of legislation concerning the eradication of cigarette smoking. To my amazement, it was the Australian Democrats who were promoting this Bill. They were opposed by the Government and the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Powell mentioned tonight that she thought the ghost of former Senator Peter Baume was in this chamber. I saw Senator Peter Baume at the airport last Friday. I would like to say that he is alive and well. His ghost will be heard, if it ever comes this way. I am sure that he will read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of tonight and take some comfort from it, because I recall that he and I and Senator Archer supported the Democrats on that occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason this Bill is a piece of major legislation is that we have reached the stage in health care in this country where most of the things that affect health care are lifestyle provisions. Sanitation, water supplies, nutrition and vaccines were the major advances in the last 100 years that have produced changes. I do not believe that in our lifetime we will see a major disease such as cancer conquered as a whole, because we do not understand the complete cause of it. However, the lifestyle changes that have affected disease processes in our lifetime have been things such as the cessation of smoking and its relationship to coronary heart disease, emphysema and other diseases associated with it and the recognition that lack of exercise and obesity were major contributing factors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that we will see in our lifetimes the conquering of degenerative and cerebrovascular diseases, such as strokes, et cetera. So we are reaching a stage in this country where the only effective modification of lifestyle that we can bring about is the cessation of smoking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Does cigarette smoking cause death? We still get specious articles sent to us by the tobacco lobbies and people purporting to be disinterested but dependent on the tobacco industry. Some sporting bodies have written to us in recent days. The answer is yes, it does cause death. That is a recent discovery in our lifetime. I recall when I started out in cancer research in 1963 that the first work proving the association between tobacco smoking and lung cancer was done by Sir Richard Doll in England in the 1960s. So that has been proved relatively recently, and everything has followed from the research done at that time. Many other forms of cancer are related to cigarette smoking. Ninety per cent of cancer of the mouth and 85 per cent of cancer of the larynx are related to cigarette smoking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next argument is that advertising does not really influence tobacco use. I wonder why the cigarette companies spend $100m a year on advertising. Is it just for the benefit of the community that they do so?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested in the comments of Senator McKiernan, which were reinforced by Senator Bishop. They would be interested to know in turn that a study was done on the influence of peer groups by the US Government earlier this year. In interviews with over 9,965 teenagers, the study found that peer group pressure was far more important than sibling pressure&mdash;and that in turn was far more important than parent pressure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The survey found that children whose friends smoked were far more likely to become smokers than those who hung out with non-smokers. Three per cent in a non-smoking crowd started smoking versus 50 per cent for those with smoking friends. Older brothers and sisters were more likely to be a bad influence than parents. Thirty per cent of adolescents reported currently smoking in homes where only older siblings smoked compared with 15 per cent of teenagers from homes where only their parents smoked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise this point because the Public Health Service Center estimated that some 3.7 million US teenagers smoked but that 92 per cent of them said that they did not plan to be smoking in another year. When those people were checked a year later it was found that only 1.5 per cent of them managed to quit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator McKiernan said, smoking is a terrible addiction. I have the greatest sympathy for cigarette smokers. From my time of treating heroin addicts, I agree with the statement that it is easier to give up heroin than cigarette smoking. The only thing is that heroin addiction is more lethal than cigarette smoking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other argument used is that if tobacco is a legal product why cannot it be advertised. We are not allowed to advertise over 150 products that are legal. Interestingly enough, one of them is nicorette, to which Senator Faulkner referred previously. The reason nicorette is not allowed to be advertised is that it is an addictive drug. One can become addicted to it quite easily. But there are many other products. Cyanide is a lethal product that cannot be advertised. Valium and the anti-depressants are quite legal, but they are not permitted to be advertised. So it is a specious argument. Another argument is, `This is the thin edge of the wedge and we will be banning Mars bars next'. I recall that being said around the place. This legislation is not about banning Mars bars or any other product; it specifically relates to the advertising of cigarettes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other aspect which has not been mentioned is passive smoking. Inevitably, passive smoking has now been accepted in a legal sense and also in a medical sense as a causation of disease. There are many research projects which have demonstrated that, going to the foetus in utero being of a smaller birth weight and being affected by the mother's smoking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I wish to refer to the fact that this legislation will not be the end of the process. It is not the last gasp, if I can use that phrase. There is a worldwide movement to control tobacco smoking. I refer particularly to the International Union Against Cancer Newsletter of September this year which notes that the ninth world conference on smoking and health will be held in Paris next year. It will be addressing a comprehensive tobacco control strategy; women and smoking; children and smoking; passive smoking; and the central and eastern European `Smokeout'. The newsletter has a report of a UICC tobacco control workshop in Moscow which found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Throughout Eastern Europe, more than one-third of all male deaths in middle age are now due to smoking, and the epidemic is still on the rise. The conference therefore calls for, as a first step, urgent action in Russia to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.Introduce (and enforce) a strict ban on all direct or indirect advertising or promotion of tobacco goods or trade marks.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.Adopt (as a minimum) European Community standards for cigarette packet health warnings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.Adopt (as a minimum) European Community standards for maximum tar deliveries, but with delays to allow national tobacco manufacturers to comply with them . . . </PARA>
<PARA>There are a number of other provisions. This is a world movement. In many respects, Australia is leading the world in its recognition of the fact that cigarette smoking is one of the few areas where we can improve the cancer death rate by reducing the factors that influence people to smoke and by reducing cigarette smoking as a whole. I commend the Bill and congratulate the Parliament on its bipartisan support. </PARA>

My grandmother was 90 years old when she died. She still played a mean game of poker and a splendid hand of bridge. She also enjoyed her cigarettes. In other words, it is a freedom.

But nobody is prepared to bite the bullet and say that, if this product is so bad, so wicked and so evil, it should be banned. Whilst it remains a legal and freely traded product, in my view it should be free to be advertised and people should exercise their freedom of choice&mdash;whether they choose to use it or not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Herron also said that the argument that this is the thin edge of the wedge is not one that is sustainable. It is. Already we have heard from Senator McKiernan that alcohol should go a similar way, and that is the way it will go. The world is full of people who believe that they can tell us how we can better live our lives. I say we can make that choice for ourselves. It may be tobacco tonight. It will be alcohol next. It will be snack foods after that, including Mars bars.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I listened to Senator Herron's speech, it occurred to me that he was making a plea to ban the sale and use of tobacco, rather than directing his attention to the question of whether or not one is entitled to advertise what is a legal product. Senator Peter Baume had a word or two to say about what constitutes a legal product. I think he was talking about what limitations are placed upon the sale of a product-be it cigarettes, alcohol or a range of other products.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did so because even before that time I had actively encouraged young people to gain the approval of their peers through activities not involving the use of advertised products such as tobacco which sought to suggest to young people that they could gain the approval of their peers by being induced to take up this habit. I actively encouraged young people to take up other activities, especially through sport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am especially pleased that basketball and hockey&mdash;the two sports especially enjoyed by my two young children at the moment&mdash;are both enjoying a boom in popularity which is in no part owed to the pariah of tobacco sponsorship. Both sports are entirely free of that insidious influence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past I have also campaigned for the reduction of the participation of local governments in the marketing of tobacco products. While I was a member of the Hobart City Council I tried without success to prevent advertising on council property, mainly on sporting grounds. However, I was able to encourage the Council to realise the benefits of declaring the council buildings smoke free. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since reaching this place I have continued to take opportunities to remove tobacco from the entrenched, habitual, insidious role that it has established in our society. I took undeserved credit when I brought forward a notice of motion against smoking in airport terminals and learnt a few hours later that such a ban had taken effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must briefly take issue with Senator McKiernan because that ban was in fact a result of a consultative process between staff, administration and users of terminals. I suggest that Senator McKiernan read the Federal Airports Corporation annual report&mdash;which may be in his in-tray at this very moment&mdash;to find out the history of that particular action, which is not as he described it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These sorts of measures are taken by people who recognise the benefits to be derived at the workplace by reducing the opportunity for compensation claims by affected workers, but also the increased productivity which derives from the simple matters of reduced cleaning costs, reduced accident rates and increased working times actually at the workplace, not to mention reduced fire risk and greatly improved worker comfort. That is all in addition to the acknowledged matter of reduced community health costs, which has been well aired tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I rise merely to endorse the remarks of so many senators who have expressed the case for supporting this Bill. In particular, I acknowledge the excellent information that was provided by both Senator Faulkner and Senator Herron, particularly Senator Herron's contribution. I cannot disagree with him as Senator Bishop does. I do not believe it is a question of freedom; it is a question of considering what is appropriate. What we are doing is banning the advertising of cigarettes; we are not at the moment embarking upon a total ban of the product. A total ban may eventually be appropriate, as it has become appropriate with the banning of chewing tobacco. It became appropriate that that product be banned. At the moment, of course, it is not appropriate to attempt to ban smoking tobacco totally. Realistically, it would be impractical to attempt such a move. We are banning sponsorship and other advertisements, and that is what I support at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to address quite quickly a question that was raised by a couple of speakers; that is, the question of peer group pressure. I suggest that it should not be dismissed in an offhand manner: `Oh, it is peer group pressure'. I suggest that we look at what peer group pressure is. It is a pressure applied especially to young people who are trying to conform to the actions of their friends and associates. We could ask why it is that peers smoke. I suggest that it is entirely associated with the concept of self-esteem and that those who are lacking in self-esteem are the subject of the advertising which preys on that problem. Many young people when they are seeking their own identity are seeking an opportunity to establish themselves in the eyes of their contemporaries. Tobacco advertising preys considerably on the doubts and the questions that are raised in the minds of adolescents. Essentially, the message provided by cigarette advertising is, `Get your self-esteem here in this picture. Associate yourself with these heroes'. The heroes, of course, have too often been those of the sporting field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sporting heroes of our past&mdash;the Cazalys, the Bradmans, the Oppermans, the Mockridges&mdash;and the more recent heroes of the Cawleys and the Curry-Kennys have reached the pinnacle of sporting prowess without the dubious benefits of tobacco sponsorship. The concept of sportsmanship that is held by such heroes owes little to the dubious benefits of tobacco sponsorship. It is possible to succeed in sport and to play good sport without tobacco sponsorship, and it is possible to assist young people in developing their sense of self-esteem and to be successful without associating this evil drug in any way with sport. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I will be responsibly brief, but I do need to respond to the second reading debate on this particularly important Bill, the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Bill. I believe it is a significant event in the history of the Senate that we should be dealing with the Bill in such a way as to demonstrate solidarity on the issue. I will deal with the misgivings of some of the senators concerned in a moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generally speaking, there has been widespread support for this measure around the chamber. I believe that it is because&mdash;as Senator Herron put it, drawing on his very considerable learning and practical experience in the field&mdash;when one looks at the scope for preventative medicine in our society, as a public health issue there is no doubt that tobacco is the major preventable cause of death and disease in Australia. Whether the figure of 18,000 Australians who died in 1990 before their time because they smoked is precisely correct, nevertheless, figures of those dimensions do require a parliament to respond. But how do we respond in a socially responsible manner?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite clearly, the idea of total prohibition of the product is beyond the pale and would simply lead to the same phenomenon as we saw with the banning of the legal sale of alcohol in the United States in the 1930s. One would simply see the marketplace supplied by unscrupulous profiteers. As a society, we would be strengthening the hands of those engaged in organised crime in Australia. That particular option is not realistically open to us because the use of tobacco in our society is a legacy of centuries. It is not to be equated, as Senator Bishop feared, with the more recent phenomenon of marijuana, heroin, cocaine use and so on. It is not something to be equated with the total prohibition of those products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking about a legacy of many centuries. We are the inheritors of that legacy. And because of its widespread cultural acceptance until now, total prohibition is out of the question. But there is no doubt that we are right, as a parliament, to take this latest initiative to deal with the sponsorship and advertising of tobacco products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I may also, of course, deal with the argument that because it is legal to sell and trade in this product, it should be legal to advertise it. Quite clearly, it is not legal to advertise all products which are legally able to be sold. For example, insulin comes to mind. It is not legal to sell tobacco products to minors. Therefore, if one keeps the analogy going, it should not be legal to advertise to minors. If in forbidding that one also, incidentally, does not enable advertising to adults, that is bad luck for the adults. So I do not find much weight in the arguments that are put in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the latest in a series of initiatives taken by the Government and parliament to reduce tobacco consumption in Australia. One thinks of the ban on smoking in Commonwealth buildings; the ban on tobacco advertising in the print media to extend the established broadcast media ban; the ban on smoking during airline flights and so on. Removing what one might call the last vestiges of tobacco advertising is an important move which is prompted mainly by our concern about children and newcomers to the particular product who take it up as a pastime which becomes an addiction very quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the second reading speech states, although advertising may not directly cause children to smoke, it reinforces other influences such as peer and social pressures which cause people to smoke. It went on to say that tobacco advertising supports and reinforces pressures to take up smoking and increases the difficulties encountered in quitting. I do not think enough emphasis has been put on that latter element. It may be enough to say that the advertising of tobacco products ought to be halted because obviously such advertising runs counter to, or dilutes, the health education messages about the ill-effects of tobacco. That in itself might be sufficient reason. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, we do not need to be absolutist or cast the tobacco lobby in the role of demons in this matter. We just need to be prudent and cautious. I believe that the Parliament is taking a prudent and cautious line in regard to the whole question of tobacco advertising in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of the linking of tobacco advertising to sport and other cultural events is particularly insidious, linking as it does an unhealthy product with a healthy activity. For example, in Tasmania one has a very good example of a different approach, where Stephen Hawkins, the gold medallist rower, has been recruited as a drug offensive ambassador. He has gone around 33 schools in Tasmania and talked to the youngsters about the evils of smoking from the point of view of a premier sportsman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Stephen Hawkins has achieved gold medal status and says to the youngsters, `I would not have achieved this status had I taken up smoking'. Senator Newman would know what a tremendous idol and hero he is amongst young people in Tasmania and how effective he has been in spreading that message. That sort of activity is to be commended and will do a lot&mdash;perhaps more than we can do&mdash;to persuade young people not to take up this habit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the extent that the Bill does establish bans on tobacco advertising, honourable senators will know that it provides for a phasing in over the period 1 July 1993 to 31 September 1995. There are further extensions in relation to certain contracts, but basically there is a phasing in. This is not a totally draconian measure which operates from the time when the legislation is passed by the Parliament. I believe that that is an important matter which modifies the otherwise untoward effect on people with legitimate expectations under contracts that they have in relation to the displaying of the names of tobacco products where sponsorship exists in relation to a particular sport or cultural event. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to deal with only one matter raised by an Opposition senator. Senator Campbell raised the very fair point about point of sale advertising. I simply wish to make it clear that in those States where in fact point of sale advertising is provided for under the State laws or regulations those laws remain in place totally unaffected by this Bill. There will be no overriding of them by the paramount force of what this Parliament is doing tonight; they will remain in place. It is only in those States or Territories&mdash;Queensland, Tasmania and the Northern Territory&mdash;where there are no such laws or regulations in place that we will provide a regulation which will be very broad in its scope and which will be the subject of extensive consultation with the industry. In fact, I met in my office with representatives of the retail tobacco traders from all around Australia only last week. I gave them the assurance that they would be involved in the actual drafting of the parameters of that regulation. I am sure they will take up that invitation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I believe that those honourable senators who found difficulty in supporting the Bill should recognise that the way in which our party system works&mdash;the Westminster system&mdash;is actually the great strength of our democracy. It means that after vigorous and democratic debate within our respective party rooms a decision which is taken is then a decision which is supported by all of us in this chamber. That is a strength which means that we cannot be picked off one by one, as in the United States congressional system where we would be the prey of every lobby group with its money and its political power. I believe that we ought to take some consolation from the strength of our democracy in this matter as we withstand some of the very heavy lobbying that has taken place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The passage of this legislation is amongst the most important health initiatives that have been taken by this Parliament since I entered Parliament some 14 years ago. We are making a major contribution towards reducing illness and premature mortality amongst Australians not only of this generation but certainly in generations to come. For that reason, I think that this early morning will be seen as a most significant one in the history of public health and preventative health strategies in Australia. I wholeheartedly commend this Bill to the Senate for the second reading. </PARA>
