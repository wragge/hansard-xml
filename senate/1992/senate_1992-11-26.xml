<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CANBERRA ACT</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to Export Inspection (Service Charge) Regulations (Amendment) (Statutory Rules 1992 No. 249) and Export Inspection (Charges Collection) Regulations (Amendment) (Statutory Rules 1992 No. 251), which the Committee considered at its meeting of 17 September 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In respect of Statutory Rules No. 249, the Committee notes the provision in new regulation 6 (inserted by regulation 5.1) for three-level progressive increases in charges for exemption from the requirements of Export Control Orders in a 12 month period. There is no indication whether any of the three levels reflects the actual cost of processing of the applications. If not, the Committee is concerned that the imposition of a graduated scale of charges for exercising what is a right conferred by legislation is in the nature of a penalty and may breach personal rights or impose liabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In respect of Statutory Rules No. 251, the Committee notes firstly that new regulation 2B (inserted by regulation 5.1) provides for the payment of charges. The Explanatory Statement mentions that the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service will generally require payment in advance or at the time of the service `for all but regular clients with a good record of payment on time'. This relaxation may be reasonable in business terms, but it is a valuable financial concession and there is no reference in the Explanatory Statement to there being any opportunity to challenge the exercise of this apparent discretion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, regulation 6 (see regulation 11.1) is omitted and, as the Explanatory Statement states, `AQIS will not refund charges in the future'. No explanation is offered for this change to the rights of clients.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thirdly, there is a reference in the Explanatory Statement (under the explanation of regulation 2B) stating that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">`regulation 2B(2) provides that no refund of this charge is to be made regardless of the outcome of the application'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulation 2B(2)is not in the regulations available to the Committee. There appears to be only regulation 2B without any division into subsections.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the regulation inserted immediately before regulation 2B is numbered regulation 2A(1) even though it, too, has only one subsection.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee would appreciate your comments on the matters raised.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Loosley</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your memorandum ac/1/2104 dated 17 September 1992 to the Hon Simon Crean, MP, Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, in which you raised a number of queries relating to the Export Inspection (Service Charge) Regulations (Amendment) (Statutory Rules 1992 No. 249) and Export Inspection (Charges Collection) Regulations (Amendment) (Statutory Rules 1992 No. 251). As the matters raised in your letter fall within my responsibilities as Minister for Resources it has been referred to me for reply.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dealing firstly with Statutory Rules No. 249, the three tier charges imposed under the new regulation 6 reflect, as accurately as is practicable, the actual costs incurred by AQIS in processing such requests from export establishments as follows&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">i.Generally, infrequent users of the exemption provisions generally require consideration of matters peripheral to the regulation of export products, such as printing errors on labels, broken seals on export containers, etc. Consequently, such matters can generally be processed by relatively junior officers within regional offices. Such checks as are conducted in these cases are minor in nature and are only required in order that should the request be repeated for future consignments, the legitimacy of the application and the wider policy issue can be considered. Consequently, in the costing of this exercise, these latter costs are seen to be more appropriately attributed to regular users of the provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ii.Where export establishments utilise the exemption provisions more than once in any 12 month period, it becomes necessary to raise the issues as policy matters regarding both the appropriateness of the Order from which exemption is sought, and the bona-fides of the requests being lodged as departures from that regulation. On that basis, reference to AQIS Senior Regional Management, and to Canberra Office (Head Office) subject experts is required, and consequently, the costs to AQIS of processing these requests is correspondingly more per half hour.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">iii.In those comparatively rare cases where export establishments routinely utilise the exemption provisions in the production of product for the export market, the highest level of individual scrutiny of the issues raised is necessary, requiring the frequent involvement of Senior Central Office Program Managers on technical and policy implications and of Regional Management in the policing of the determination. In addition, accrued costs incurred by AQIS under (i) above are considered to be entirely attributable to this class of operator, and have been included in the costing accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On that basis, it can be seen that the graduated scale of charges validly reflects AQIS costs of processing requests for exemption from the provisions of the Export Control Orders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Furthermore, it needs to be clarified that such exemptions are not a right conferred by legislation. Rather they are a discretion to be exercised by the Secretary in limited and defined circumstances. In the event that the applicant is dissatisfied with the Secretary's exercise of that discretion, recourse to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal is available.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under Statutory Rules No. 251, the new Export Inspection (Charges Collection) regulation 2B was inserted by regulation 5.1 to enable AQIS to progressively develop its systems to emulate commercial practice. In this context you may know that from 1 July 1993 AQIS will be operating on a Group 2 Trust Account. This move will require AQIS to employ full accrual accounting systems, including provisions for bad and doubtful debts. Clearly, the costs of such provision accounts will have to be passed on to AQIS' clients in the form of higher charges. AQIS' current proposal is to minimise such provisions by requiring payment at time of service or in advance if the cost of the service can be calculated. Although consultation with AQIS' clients and industry bodies will be taking place over the next six to eight months on this matter, early indications are that most will be in favour of such an approach. This is not surprising as the alternative would be a provision for bad and doubtful debts in the order of some $4 million per annum to be passed on to industry in higher charges.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Essentially, AQIS is looking to develop systems where payment in advance or at the time of service becomes normal practice, with payments by account only in those cases where payment in advance or at the time of the service cannot be administratively achieved. In the interim, payment by account, with a due date of the twenty-eighth day of the month following the month in which the service is provided (as under the previous provisions of the Collection Act) continues to be the predominant mode of collection.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The development of policy for the equitable administration of debt collection and credit facilities will, as is indicated above, proceed in the closest consultation with industry, and in the recognition that decisions of AQIS management in this connection are subject to review through various mechanisms, but notably under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In response to your query regarding the omission of Regulation 6, achieved by regulation 11.1, the provision for refunds was eliminated for a number of reasons. AQIS registration charges are predominantly calculated to cover the costs of infrastructure services, including the negotiation of conditions of access to overseas markets for products which are almost without exception seasonal commodities. Consequently, the charge represents a fixed cost for services which are utilised by the industry principally during the operating season, but also throughout the year in the form of advice regarding maintenance, refurbishment and other matters during the `off-season'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The application of the then Regulation 6(1) resulted in an increasing trend for operators to only maintain registration during the period in which they required inspection services at their establishment, that being the only time when registration is legally obligatory. Notwithstanding their de-registration and associated refund, such operators would continue to call upon AQIS advisory services in various capacities, and re-register immediately before the next season. This trend, and the refund provision generally were diametrically opposed to the nature of these charges as a fixed cost in any financial year and, if allowed to proceed unchecked, would have either eliminated the Registration Charge as a meaningful avenue for meeting AQIS infrastructure costs or, would have required substantial increases to the charge to allow the relevant costs to be covered by revenue generated during the peak season for each of the industries involved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulation 6(2) on the other hand, was considered to be dysfunctional: firstly, if the rate for the following year were to fall, the regulations provided that a refund was payable in respect of those months of registration left to run on the date on which the new charge became effective. No corresponding provision was made for additional amounts to become payable in those cases where the rate for annual registration rose. Secondly, the provision acted as a distinct disincentive to the reduction by AQIS of Registration charges since any reduction must be determined so as to allow not simply for the reduced AQIS costs to be covered, but also the amounts to be refunded to operators of establishments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reference to Regulation 2B(2) in the explanatory notes is a regrettable administrative oversight resulting from the progressive development of the explanatory notes as versions of the new regulations were produced by the drafter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similarly, the Office of Legislative Drafting in the Attorney-General's Department has advised that the inclusion of the superfluous subregulation number in respect of regulation 2A(1) was an editing error that occurred in that office.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I trust that the above information adequately addresses the Committee's concerns regarding the recent amendments made to the legislation governing the imposition and collection of the various export inspection charges.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yours sincerely</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It depends where one's vested interest is, Senator Watson. Fringe benefits tax is a relatively recent tax which seeks to increase the equity of the tax system by identifying fringe benefits which are provided by employers to their employees, benefits which are not subject to tax in the hands of the employee. Fringe benefits tax is imposed on the employer who provides the benefit, hence it is technically paid by the employer. However, in practice the true incidence falls on the employee because the employer takes into account any fringe benefits tax liability which is generated by the provision of fringe benefits&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Superannuation.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XW4">Senator KERNOT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;and the other areas of the employee's salary package are varied accordingly&mdash;just like superannuation, as Senator Kemp says. So it is generally not accurate to say that an increase in FBT slugs employers. It is not accurate to say that, although, of course, in some situations it may. Despite all the protestation from the Opposition benches, fringe benefits tax is a fair tax&mdash;I am talking about the tax in principle&mdash;because it seeks to ensure that non-cash benefits are taxed in an equivalent manner to cash benefits. There is currently a structural problem which arises because the fringe benefits tax rate is different from the company tax rate, which still means fringe benefits are concessionally taxed relative to cash benefits. There is another Bill before the Senate to correct that problem, and I will deal with that issue more fully during the debate on that legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the fringe benefits tax was introduced and vehemently opposed by the coalition, certain matters were exempted, and one of those was car parking benefits. There are two types of benefits. Firstly, there is the direct provision of a parking space by an employer, and this can be either on site or off site in a commercial parking station. Secondly, the employer can provide an `expense reimbursement fringe benefit' whereby the employer reimburses the employee for the car parking costs, which are first paid by the employee. In both those instances the employee obtains a valuable benefit in a tax advantaged manner relative to employees who have to pay for their own parking out of their after-tax salary or wages. So the Government is arguing that removing the exemption is a matter of tax equity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there is some merit in that argument although, to be totally consistent, the existing exemptions should be completely removed. But that is not what the Government is proposing. The exemption is being removed only when the following conditions apply: where the vehicle is the employee's or the employer's, or is leased by either person and is used by the employee to commute to work; where a permanent commercial car park is available for all-day parking within one kilometre of the employer provided facility; where the parking is for more than four hours between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m.&mdash;this is apparently structured to try to exempt some shift workers who may not have reasonable public transport services available and to exempt short stays by employees who subsequently use their vehicles, for example, in the case of couriers; and where the car is parked at or in the vicinity of the employee's workplace. I gather that this final provision is included to ensure that no liability arises when the parking is not connected with commuting to work; for example, if an employee visits another office of the employer or of a client and uses a parking space provided by the employer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major complaints from the business and professional community concern the administration of this proposed impost. There are claims that the one kilometre test, in particular, will be very difficult to administer and will lead to anomalies in the incidence of the tax. Those employers who have been forced by planning laws or decisions to provide parking facilities claim that the tax burden will fall on them unfairly. There is also the further question of whether some employers should be specifically exempted because of the possible flow-on consequences to those employers. An example is the impact that may be felt by some schools and some hospitals. These arguments will be further examined in the hearings of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other relevant point that can be made on this issue and that has not been canvassed by the Opposition is the ecologically sustainable development angle. Honourable senators might be aware that the ESD working groups recommended that the exemption be removed. This was based on the principle that the FBT was unintentionally providing a substantial subsidy to those who commuted to work by private vehicles. If an employer pays an employee's public transport fares for travel to and from work or reimburses the employee in respect of that travel, FBT will be payable on the full amount of the subsidy yet, if parking benefits are provided, no FBT will arise. That is clearly a subsidy structure which will work against sustainable development. So there are both environmental and equity considerations that have to be considered by the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major matters in the cognate package of Bills are the changes proposed by the Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Bill, which proposes massive changes to the tax regime that applies to superannuation in this country. The Bill is proposing to legislate the changes announced by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) in his `Security in Retirement' statement of 30 June this year. The Bill has been referred to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and will be considered in detail this evening. The most controversial proposal in this package is the immediate termination of the personal deduction provisions for supported employees. Currently an employee who obtains employer superannuation support, because of an industrial award only, is allowed to obtain a tax deduction for personal contributions made to a fund up to a limit of $3,000. The Commonwealth has, quite properly, encouraged people with inadequate levels of employer sponsored superannuation to top up their entitlements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can all remember Mr Keating calling on Australians to take up this challenge when he increased the deduction from $1,500 to $3,000 just a few years ago. So many Australians did listen; they did decide to take out top-up policies. They knew that they had not had sufficient capacity to save in previous years and here was a golden opportunity to provide themselves with an adequate retirement income. Where they exercised their option simply to contribute personal contributions to award funds or to employer sponsored funds, this proposal could be justified as the particular employees would not be disadvantaged by ceasing to contribute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there are many tens of thousands of Australians who took out specific personal superannuation policies. These are binding contractual arrangements which obligated people to contribute for many years. The main benefit of the policy is the up-front deduction which is now being terminated. As Senator Watson pointed out last night, unfortunately it was terminated out of the blue with, as I understand it, 24 hours notice. This is one of the matters that will be examined in the Select Committee, as will the aspect of the penalties which apply to fund members who cease making contributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think that the Government can justify not only completely reversing a policy which was so important just a few years ago, but also imposing a further cost on policy holders by forcing them to discontinue contributions and hence be slugged with some huge penalties taken from the existing balance in the fund. I understand that we have a compulsory regime now. If there is a legislative compulsory regime obviously people do not need to be given incentives, but in the short term we really do need to give people an incentive to top up. The SGC is important. It will become the dominant retirement income, but the SGC alone will not provide anything like an adequate financial base for retirement for some decades to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the meantime, there must be reasonable top-up provisions. The Government has recognised this by allowing incredibly generous employer contribution limits depending upon the age of the employee concerned. Those over 55 will be entitled to receive $62,000 per annum in employer contributions. So for those with compliant employers there is the option that the employer take over the contributions and the tax benefit will simply be retained by way of a salary sacrifice arrangement. That is now happening; managers and high income earners are in the position to make such arrangements but low income earners who have little industrial muscle will lose their tax deduction, although some may qualify for the revised rebate arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This measure will have regressive effects in that higher income earners will simply enter salary sacrifice arrangements. That will tend to erode some of the claimed revenue savings of $230m per year that the Government is hoping it will raise. I think the sensible way through this is to have some sort of phase-out arrangements so that the concessions are reduced at the same time as the SGC contributions are increasing. There are many people in their forties and fifties&mdash;probably the age group of most people in this chamber at the moment&mdash;who should be allowed to save for their retirement under the current law. They should not be targeted and penalised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue I wish to mention is the reform of the RBLs. It could be argued that this is a politically motivated decision on taxation. We have a virtually unique situation in Australian history where the coalition has committed itself to a radical alteration of the tax regime applicable to superannuation. It proposes to tax all contributions so as to equalise the tax benefit that each dollar of contribution earns. Also a flat rate RBL limit of $300,000 is proposed, and the coalition seeks to increase the tax on earnings from 15 per cent to 20 per cent. We think that the total effect of that package would be quite progressive and it would also raise substantial amounts of revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would have thought that the Labor Party would have seen that policy as something of a godsend, but instead of being an opportunity to be seen as making the tax system fairer, this has become an opportunity for the Government to, in my view, continue to favour a more regressive tax regime on superannuation. Whilst the broadening of the income tax base achieved by Mr Keating has generally increased equity, this has been more than offset by the failure to increase the exemption threshold and the very large cuts in the higher tax rates and extravagances such as the imputation system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This RBL decision continues that trend because, whilst the flat rate system is touted as a great reform, the very high lump sum limit of $400,000 and the doubling of that amount where at least half of the benefit is taken as a pension or an annuity in fact mean that the potential tax concession has been greatly increased from the current arrangements. Realistically, what sort of people and how many will be able to accumulate anything like $400,000 for their retirement? Not many average workers will exceed that threshold. How many people will reach $800,000? Very few, I would think. So the net effect of this will be to allow managers and professionals to obtain higher superannuation benefits at the same time as battlers making contributions at the rate of $3,000 a year are being denied any income tax relief. I just do not think that reads like normal Labor Party equity policy. </PARA>

Those amendments have now been distributed but I formally indicate to the Senate their intention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I expected the fringe benefits tax on car parking to generate the most heat, particularly from the Opposition. It has been the subject of a particularly skilled public relations campaign by an industry that has the capacity to pay very high fees to one of the top public relations agencies in Australia to mount the usual campaign for an industry that has a particular tax benefit and therefore knows that a big investment in public relations is worth doing if it means saving the tax benefit. I had a debate on radio with a representative of the car parking association and I said to him, `Tell me the alternative mechanism by which you think your industry should be taxed'. He said, `I do not think it should be taxed at all'. That is the core of the argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking about some people who have a significant benefit and an industry that has capitalised that benefit to its profit, and it has mounted a very sophisticated public relations campaign seeking to defend their privilege. Those people have gone for the two classic techniques. Each time we try to amend the tax laws to take away from people, particularly those in privileged positions, that privilege, they have two techniques. The first technique is to conscript a few low paid examples one might find in isolated instances who may conceivably, by some interpretation of the Act, be involved and pretend that it is a debate about them, when we all know that it is not. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Watson knows that the rich always conscript the poor, and he always falls for it. The second technique is arguing complexity: `This is going to be so complex'. What they really mean is&mdash;and the core to it has been exposed by the car parking association&mdash;`Do not take away our little perk'. The answer is, `No, we will not fall for that'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is fundamentally about fairness in the tax system. The core concept of fringe benefits tax, the core concept that underpinned and provided the absolute justification&mdash;now accepted by the Opposition&mdash;for the fringe benefits tax, applies equally to this. All those people who purport to be defending simplicity when they are actually defending privilege are doing the same again. There are those who are consciously defending privilege and there are those who fall for the arguments every time. Honourable senators opposite may categorise themselves. I do not care which category they put themselves in; they are one or the other. I will bet that, if they ever get into office, they will never repeal this provision&mdash;ever. They will take the revenue and they will recognise the fairness. They will not touch it; they will come in here in the hope that some company will send them a big cheque for the election campaign, but they will not do a thing about it. Nor should they. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The core concept is right. It is exactly the same principle as applies to all these fringe benefits. The argument is quite simple. Yesterday I had to put this argument to my own constituents, who wished that they were not being affected. I had to say to them, `You will be and you should be'. That is not the world's most popular argument to put to people who, in the normal course of events, would be my supporters&mdash;and who I hope still will be. But the fact of it is this. If two people are paid the same salary for doing the same function and park next to each other in the building, and if one person's car parking is paid by the employer but the other pays it himself out of after-tax income, there is absolutely no argument against the idea that the person who is having that car parking paid for him is getting an enhanced after-tax income and a benefit from the employer as if he were getting higher income, and he should be taxed accordingly. It is the most straightforward of arguments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It does not apply to public hospitals, but the honourable senator should just not worry about it. The fact of the matter is quite simple: yes, it is a tax Bill; yes, it will raise revenue; and yes, that is important. It is absolutely important also that we raise the revenue in the fairest possible manner. We need to fund the services that we provide to the taxpayers in Australia. Notwithstanding the significantly misleading contributions by the Opposition, Australia remains one of the lowest taxed countries in the OECD&mdash;in the bottom two or three, depending upon the way you want to measure it. Of the 24 OECD countries, we come in at No. 22 or 23 in terms of the level of tax in Australia. So it is not that Australia is a relatively heavily taxed country. It is important that we continue the process of making our tax system fair. I will not shrink from that. People who get benefit, irrespective of their mode of employment, ought to pay tax on it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the superannuation matter, as I said, it is the most important of these pieces of legislation, but I will not spend much time on it because we have a committee hearing this afternoon. The legislation implements the security and retirement statement which had the valid principles of providing people with certainty and making a fairer tax regime. It has to be looked at in the context of the package of measures of which it is a part, and particularly in the context of the superannuation guarantee charge. That is the mechanism that drives the fairness of the package as a whole and, particularly, the fairness of the package for low income earners and women. They are the people who are the beneficiaries of the superannuation guarantee charge. People cannot look at one element of a package in isolation. They have to look at the package and say that, taken in context, it is a very important reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most striking criticism was that the Government was not being bold enough in reforming superannuation. That was made by Senator Alston last night. I have to say no-one ever pretends that the reforms they introduce are perfect, but I do not think history will judge this Government as having been weak in failing to address the issues of superannuation. Other people might say that we took the wrong course, and Senator Alston does. It is a legitimate debate that goes to the core question about voluntarism versus compulsion. I do not share his view but he is entitled to that. But to say that we have not been prepared to challenge and face up to the superannuation issue is extraordinary, when we are doing it for the first time after everybody knew for 45 years that it had to be done. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last point I want to make is in relation to the child support legislation&mdash;in many ways, the least significant of the Bills, but one which needs a bit of consideration because we are to go to the committee stage straightaway. I have indicated the amendments that are outlined and I welcome the fact that there is general support for the provisions of the Bill and for the amendments which we have circulated. I understand the concern raised by the Opposition and the Australian Democrats with particular reference to the so-called averment. It is an issue that always causes concern to the Senate when it is raised. If it has the potential in its application to undermine the rights of citizens to fair trial and to reverse the onus of proof in a manner that puts the liberties of citizens at risk, it is very important that we give proper attention to this matter. In the committee stage when we come to deal with those clauses I imagine we will have an opportunity to look at some typical scenarios in which this might apply, so I will not duplicate that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do want to take some care to repeat the arguments that the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) put in the letter to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee about this Bill. The argument is essentially summarised in the position put by the Treasurer on that occasion when he said he recognised the concern of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee concerning evidence by averment, but, of course, that related to a report on criminal proceedings. He said that the proceedings undertaken by the Agency are, of course, civil rather than criminal and would result in a pecuniary fine and not a gaol sentence. That does not totally do away with any concern but I think it changes the context within which it might be seen. Notwithstanding that, the intention behind the proposal to insert a provision in the child support legislation is one to allow the prosecution to aver fact only, and so assist the court and both parties in the carriage of any prosecution where the fact is or should not be disputed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems we have had in the Child Support Agency is the delay in the effective discharge by the Agency through the courts of the prosecutions. Sometimes that delay is caused by errors at the administrative end, sometimes by the very nature of the case or the way it is handled by the courts, but sometimes it is caused by the complexity of the process&mdash;the complexity of the level of proof required for mundane matters of fact. This is ultimately connected to the ability of the Agency to collect support for children in single parent families which is, after all, what is driving the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The correspondence that I and, I am sure, other senators get is often to do with delays in the prosecution process&mdash;the frustration experienced when it is established or at least agreed, and is clearly the view of the Agency and the custodial parent, that there is an entitlement which is effectively not able to be enforced because of the delays in the court processes. This is one measure by which we can deal with that. We have always to balance the issues before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The explanatory memorandum states that the Agency, through the averment provision, does not wish to deny a person natural justice, nor can it. Nor does it want to do more under the proposed provisions than to state in the information that a particular matter is a fact&mdash;for example, a notice to obtain information was issued on a certain date or a final notice was issued on a certain date or a summons was issued on a certain date&mdash;because sometimes the requirements of the courts to prove that those things took place actually lead to significant delays. That is not because anyone is doing anything wrong; it is what the law currently requires. But those delays are not just technical matters; those delays have a profound effect on the living standard of children and custodial parents and frustrate the proper purpose of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These types of matters are procedural and factual and they do not infer any type of conduct or intention by a defendant. It would be abnormal to mix matters of law and fact in an averment, in a child support prosecution, but the proposed provision states that, in the event that they were to be mixed, the averment is prima facie evidence of the fact only. Moreover, if the matter that is averred is challenged by the defendant&mdash;for example, if the defendant were to argue that a notice was not received&mdash;then the court must consider any evidence provided on its merits. It becomes a matter for the defendant and the prosecution to attempt to tip the scales in their favour. The evidence submitted will determine the outcome, and the value of that evidence is not affected by the averment provision. What we are seeking to do is simplify for the court the process of establishing fact in a prosecution when that fact should not be in question. To the extent that it is not challenged, the averment provisions will do that. But if a fact is challenged, normal processes will apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I went to some length about that matter, which is at its heart a minor issue compared with all the other matters before us, because, first of all, we are going to have to deal with it in a moment and, secondly, it is a minor issue with significant consequences for a number of people in need in our country. I hope, therefore, that we will be able in the committee stage to persuade the Committee that it should accept the proposals which have been put forward. I thank the Senate for supporting those elements of the package which it has supported and look forward to the speedy passage of the remainder after due debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I outlined in my speech at the second reading stage, we have some major problems with clause 38. This involves averments. We argue that the Government simply has not given us a reason as to why it needs this provision, other than apparently it is going to be slightly easier to administer. Also, as I noted previously with regard to clause 38, there is no provision here to in any way restrict the use of the averment. It does not make here any reference to limiting the proposed averment to matters particularly within the knowledge of the defendant, and it does not restrict it to formalities or to the specific ingredients of the charge. Therefore, the Democrats will be opposing clause 38.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not wish to say much more than I did in the debate on the second reading. I understand the concerns that honourable senators have. Every senator in the chamber has from time to time had concerns about these sorts of issues; essentially I made them the thrust of the argument in summing up the second reading debate. The only argument I would put in supplement is this: although the wording is capable of the interpretation Senator Lees puts on it, the Child Support Act and the nature of the prosecutions that might be taken under it actually do not raise the sorts of issues that potentially arise and cause the concerns that, for example, first motivated the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee when it started to raise the issue of averment. These issues have led to its being a consistent feature of Senate concerns since that time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at the prosecutable offences under the Child Support Act, one would see that we are not really dealing here with the sorts of issues that might cause the concerns Senator Alston raised last night and which Senator Lees raised today and last night. I said in private conversation to Senator Alston last night that, if I thought the Bill meant the things which he raised and was consistent with those which Senator Lees raised, I would not support that clause either. It would not be in the Bill. That does not mean that I am right and others are wrong. They are entitled to their view and, if the Committee also has that view, I do not want to pretend that the legislation will collapse from want of this clause; it will not. What will happen is that some prosecutions, which through their successful conclusion might expedite payments to children and custodial parents with rights to that money, will take longer and sometimes may not be concluded at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the nature of the offences. They include failure to provide information, or failure of an employer to deduct or remit or to provide information or to advise an employee or to keep appropriate records. They are summaries; they are not full descriptions of the offences, but those are the offences to which we are referring. People cannot be prosecuted under this for the sorts of serious offences that, for example, arise under the Crimes Act or the Income Tax Assessment Act where the concerns of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee that prompted this continuing concern might reasonably arise. This provision will only facilitate child support prosecutions, and it assists the court when the fact is beyond doubt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point is that, where the facts are challenged, the amendment makes it clear that the averment does not have any special impact. For example, in the most common case, which is failure to provide information as requested, if there is an averment that a notice issued and it is challenged by the person, who says, `I did not receive it', the averment does not become the basis of establishing the argument. The Agency would have the normal obligations that apply at the moment to prove to the satisfaction of the court that that document did issue and it could reasonably be argued that it was received. So that is the circumstance in which this might be applied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to take up the time of the Committee with undue debate. Everybody here understands the principles. It is an issue of some concern but not of earth-shattering importance. I accept that. I understand the concerns of Senator Alston and Senator Lees; they are proper concerns. We have them, but we think that, on balance, this is an appropriate circumstance for the facilitation of these relatively minor&mdash;but nevertheless significant to the individuals affected&mdash;offences where this averment provision should apply to facilitate child support prosecutions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition supports the Antarctic (Environment Protection) Legislation Amendment Bill 1992. The Bill amends the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act 1980 to meet Australia's obligations under the Madrid Protocol prior to ratification. It makes provision for environmental assessment in the Antarctic, a new system of protected areas in the Antarctic, greater protection for Antarctic fauna and flora and their habitat, and the making of regulations providing for environmental impact procedures and for waste management and waste disposal. It also incorporates the provisions of the Antarctic Mining Prohibition Act 1991, with some amendments consistent with the Madrid Protocol, into the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act 1980.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly), in her second reading speech in the other place, repeated here, was discourteous enough to urge members of the Opposition to be equally as firm as the Government in their support of the legislation. That is the usual arrogant nonsense we expect from the Minister. There is no need for her to urge us to support this legislation. We initiated this move. That is why I must say that the prattlings of the Minister, which indicate that she considers herself to be the only political protector of the environment, are just so much phoney nonsense. I am glad to see Senator Bourne nodding her head in agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, there is no acknowledgment in the Minister's press release of 15 October 1992 that the Opposition had any role whatsoever in supporting from the very beginning what this legislation is all about. That is typical and unfortunate. This is an area where there is bipartisan support, so there is no need for her condescendingly to urge members of the Opposition to be equally firm in our support of it, and I reject the general atmospheric from the Minister that the coalition has no interest in or concern for this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the contrary: apart from the fact that we initiated this particular matter in opposition, when in government we have taken a consistently strong role in protecting the Antarctic. For over 30 years Australia has been one of 40 parties to the Antarctic Treaty, which has governed the activities of countries with claims on the Antarctic Territory or conducting activities there. The Treaty, by the way, had its origins in the Cold War and, with both the United States and the USSR as signatories, it played an important role in keeping Cold War tensions out of the area. In fact, the Antarctic Treaty of 1959 was a very important measure in which the Menzies Government was involved. It was a great milestone internationally and it was something that the Menzies Government was, quite properly, very proud of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following six years of negotiations with a regime that would have permitted mining in the Antarctic, in 1991 the Treaty parties signed a document known as the Madrid Protocol, which prohibits mining altogether. I repeat: this approach to prohibit mining was initiated by the Opposition, by the coalition in Australia, particularly by former Senator Chris Puplick. If anyone wants to go back to the record, they can see that, while Mrs Kelly was still flapping around about the Canberra Raiders, Senator Puplick was actively and effectively promoting the proposition that mining should be prohibited in Antarctica. I notice, however, that history has been rewritten and Mr Hawke is now the hero of this matter, although apparently a fairly fallen hero at the moment. Following the coalition's initiation, the Government decided in May 1989 not to sign the proposed minerals convention. Australia, supported initially by France, eventually persuaded the other Treaty parties to agree to the Madrid Protocol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since initiating the moves leading to the signing of the Madrid Protocol, the coalition has supported the Government's actions, with one exception, namely, the decision to summarily remove the huskies from the Mawson base this month. This Bill provides for their removal by 1 April 1994, in accordance with the provision in annexe 2 of the Protocol. The British have decided that their obligations will be met simply by stopping the further breeding of huskies in Antarctica and letting the existing dogs live out their natural lives there, in an environment they have known all their lives. We, in opposition, have urged the Government to follow the same procedure, but without success. I understand that the huskies are now in Minnesota. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This problem reflects the typical arrogance of the Government and this Minister because there is no clear, obvious need for these huskies to have been removed this month except for the Government's claimed commercial opportunity. According to the Government's chosen interpretation of the Protocol, there were 18 months to go before the huskies should be removed. As evidenced, the British have taken the view that they are meeting the requirements without having to send the huskies away from Antarctica. But is it not interesting the way the Minister uses words in a mischievous and misleading way? In her press release, Mrs Kelly interprets as appalling our proposal that they should stay there and follow the British position of, if necessary, not being allowed to breed and so on. She refers to statements by the shadow Minister for the environment, Mr Carlton, that Australia's huskies should be left in Antarctica to die. That is simply dishonest. They are to be left in Antarctica to live until they die. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am, frankly, sick and tired of the politicising of this sort of issue by the Minister. It is a disgrace to use words in that phoney, crooked way. She says, `We have given the opportunity to let them live', as if our proposal were to kill them off&mdash;which is simply false and dishonest. So what is new from this Minister? According to her press release, Mrs Kelly said, `Given that the dogs must be removed'. If they `must' be removed, how come the British are not doing so? We find not only what she is doing but the manner in which she has done it to be unacceptable and unreasonable. It was for that reason that, when this matter was in the House of Representatives, we sought to amend the motion for the second reading of the Bill. We cannot do that now because it is a fait accompli. In the House of Representatives we moved:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: "whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House expresses its grave concern over the decision of the Minister for Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories to remove the Mawson Bay huskies from their long term environment and to give them to a resort operator in the USA, and calls on the Minister to reverse this decision and follow the British example of allowing the dogs to live out their lives in the Antarctic".</PARA>
<PARA>That motion was defeated in the House of Representatives. I just want the Australian public to recognise that, despite the best endeavours by the coalition, the Government's normal authoritarian, dictatorial approach, as expressed through this Minister, was carried on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The extent to which this sort of behaviour is unacceptable is evident from what the friends of the huskies have been conveying. As a community that describes itself as the Friends of the Polar Sledge Dogs, they have been making a strong case about this. For example, Mr Patrick Moonie, in a recent article saying that there is no sound environmental reason to remove huskies from Antarctica, says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Mawson huskies have been isolated in the pristine Antarctic working environment for 41 years and, with no record of acquiring, carrying or transmitting disease, it is ludicrous to suggest that they could start now. Similarly, there is no evidence that they have been a threat to wildlife and, with more stringent controls recently introduced, the incidence of threat is even more remote.</PARA>
<PARA>He states that, in 1988, a nationwide campaign for retention of the huskies in Antarctica&mdash;and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . resulted in an investigation by the then Minister, Senator Graham Richardson, who issued a statement that the huskies were not a threat to the environment and that there were no plans for their removal.  </PARA>
<PARA>It is magic, is it not, the way that suddenly changed. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Antarctic Division director, Rex Moncur, also stated that they were far better for the environment than any mechanical vehicle.</PARA>
<PARA>In his article, Mr Moonie states also:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More importantly, huskies are unquestionably the safest means of transport over the unpredictable and sometimes treacherous sea ice and heavily crevassed glaciers. During our Antarctic operations a large number of vehicles of all types have fallen through the sea ice . . . Other Antarctic nations have lost not only vehicles but men's lives also. To this day, we have not lost a dog team or attendant sledges.</PARA>
<PARA>On this matter, the Friends of the Polar Sledge Dogs give an outline of what the coalition has done to try to assist them. Regarding the time when the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) was the shadow spokesman for the environment, they say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Chaney wrote to Mrs Kelly and put this matter to her:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Would you please provide me with any material produced either by Australia or by any other parties to the Protocol which may have been used as a factual base for the pressure to remove the dogs? If there is no such material and if the decision was taken purely on a subjective judgement it seems to me to weaken considerably the case for their removal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mrs Kelly's answer was a bureaucratic "Yes Minister" classic, claiming that the Protocol working papers were not available for public distribution! It now seems certain that there is no factual basis, either environmental or operational, to substantiate the removal of the huskies and that is probably the reason why the Minister has been so evasive in refusing to respond to correspondence on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA>The Friends continue:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Chaney also questioned Mrs Kelly on whether any difficulties had been experienced by vehicles travelling over the Antarctic seaice, noting the exemplary comparative safety record of the huskies over the same terrain for the last 37 years. In reply, Mrs Kelly highlighted the amphibious function of Hagglunds vehicles and that they had experienced but "few difficulties". This blithely ignored the two Hagglunds (replacement cost $200,000 each) that sank through the seaice off Davis Station, one of which was subsequently salvaged and rebuilt at a cost of $90,000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Opposition has serious reservations on the decision by the Government to remove the huskies and Senator Michael Baume (Liberal NSW) recently put a series of related questions to DASET and Antarctic Division at a Senate Estimates Committee hearing. There were some interesting concessions and admissions contained in the evidence, including the fact that no study has been done that would enable a comparative analysis of the viability of the huskies as a means of transport in the Mawson Station environment in Antarctica. The Secretary of the Department attempted to link the European seal virus with the Antarctic huskies. This hoary old chestnut was first thrown up in 1988 by fringe elements of the environmental movement and has since been thoroughly debunked by the scientific community. In 1988 the North Atlantic European Grey seals suffered a virus attack that killed several hundred. It was suggested that a canine virus was the cause and, by an amazing extrapolation, that canines (ie huskies) in the Antarctic might therefore wreak havoc with the Antarctic wildlife. An investigation by reputable scientific bodies established that the Grey seal deaths were due to a livestock virus causing rinderpest (cattle plague) and had no relation to any canine virus. . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the Government becoming increasingly intransigent and resorting to disinformation on the huskie issue it would appear that a review of the situation is only possible with a change of Government.</PARA>
<PARA>I must say it was very sensible of the Friends to recognise what sort of improvements one would get with a change of government. The Friends reported:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition is in favour of undertaking an Environmental Assessment Study on the Mawson huskies, using the procedures outlined in the Protocol specifically designed for such a purpose, in order to establish a position based on factual evidence and consistent with our international treaty obligations.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, it is now all too late for that because, 18 months earlier than the Government claimed they had to go, they have been evacuated to Minnesota. As the Friends asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is it an attempt to pre-empt a review by the Opposition, should they win government in the autumn of 1993?</PARA>
<PARA>I must say that, yes, I believe it was. I believe it was a deliberate attempt to prevent the Opposition reviewing this arrogant determination. As the Friends conclude:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principal aim of our campaign is to retain the huskies in Antarctica, where they rightly belong because of the overwhelming evidence of their environmental compatibility, their better safety record than vehicles over particular terrain and the fact that they represent, more than anything else, the intrinsic ethos of our polar endeavours, their removal would thus constitute an act of gross historical vandalism. If the huskies must be removed from Antarctica then they must be retained as working teams in Australia, for to do otherwise would be an appalling indictment on the Government and an abrogation of our national heritage.</PARA>
<PARA>I conclude by saying that I should make it clear that the Bill as a whole is in line with the policy which the coalition suggested originally and which was taken up by the Government. It is in line with the actions of coalition governments in the past&mdash;for example, the Menzies Government in 1959 in entering into the Treaty, and the Fraser Government in 1980 in bringing down the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Bill. As a result, I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

It is gratifying indeed to be able to speak to a Bill on the environment which so clearly accords with Democrats policy and, indeed, with the policies of all parties in this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Madrid Protocol stands out as a shining example of what countries can achieve through international environmental diplomacy. It recognises the unparalleled wilderness and aesthetic qualities of Antarctica and its immense value as an area for the conduct of scientific research. It sets up procedures to ensure proper protection of the whole continent and prohibits mining in the Antarctic Territory. It recognises that the human impact must be contained and minimised in order to ensure that the earth's last pristine wilderness is preserved, not just for the benefit of all future generations but for its intrinsic value as an area of great beauty and its own worth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has taken a leading role in the preparation of the Madrid Protocol, reflecting the prominent role played by Australia in the history of Antarctica and in the development of the Antarctic Treaty. Australia is one of the currently 26 consultative parties to the Treaty, which came into force in 1961. The impetus for the Treaty is thought to be the International Geophysical Year, which involved scientists from many countries in research programs on that continent. The IGY was so successful that countries claiming sovereignty over parts of Antarctica were encouraged to settle their differences and develop a more cooperative approach to the use of that continent. The outcome of their efforts was the Antarctic Treaty, which included a stipulation that Antarctica should be used exclusively for peaceful purposes and not become the scene or object of international discord. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the development of the initial Treaty, a number of agreements have been reached which further the protection of the Antarctic environment and its biological diversity. These include the agreed measures for the conservation of Antarctic fauna and flora; the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Seals; a code of conduct for Antarctic expeditions and station activities; the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources; guidelines to evaluate the environmental impact of proposed scientific research programs; and sites of special scientific interest, which protects specified areas of research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite these measures, the record of environmental protection in Antarctica has been poor. The International Whaling Commission has reported serious depletions in the populations of whales in Antarctic waters. The Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources was signed in 1977. However, by 1983 overfishing had caused dramatic reductions in a number of fish stocks. A number of Antarctic bases have failed to implement appropriate waste management plans, simply disposing of wastes into the surrounding environment; and in some cases severe localised damage has ensued.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the measures I have just outlined were important first steps, they failed to incorporate a whole systems approach to environmental protection. The Madrid Protocol reflects such an approach by seeking comprehensive protection for the environment. Australia's role in the development of the Protocol was absolutely pivotal, and it is something of which every Australian can feel very proud. For many years certain countries had harboured an interest in Antarctic mineral resources. In June 1988 the Antarctic Minerals Convention was adopted by a special Antarctic Treaty consultative committee in Wellington. The underlying assumption of the Treaty was that mining and environmental protection were compatible. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Exxon Valdez</EMPHASIS> disaster proved that such an assumption is totally false. One cannot ensure, no matter what precautions are taken, that accidents will not happen. The risk of environmental damage is simply too high to allow mining activity to proceed in such a fragile environment as Antarctica. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the relief of many Australians concerned about the prospect of mining, after considerable pressure from all sides of this Parliament, the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, announced on 22 May 1989 that Australia was opposed to mining in Antarctica and would not sign the Minerals Convention. He confirmed that Australia would pursue the concept of Antarctica as a wilderness park and would seek an extension of the moratorium on mining. France joined Australia's initiative. Other countries saw merit in the proposal, with the US finally falling into line in July 1991. The Protocol was finally signed in June last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The story of Australia's role in the development of the Protocol reveals how effective Australia can be on the international stage, provided the Australian Government is willing to take a strong and proactive role in international environmental negotiations. It is extremely disappointing to hear repeatedly these days how Australia's stature as an international leader in environmental affairs has diminished considerably. This is particularly obvious in ozone and climate change negotiations. Australia took a leading position at the 1990 London review of the Montreal Protocol. The Australian Government allowed a youth delegation to attend, which made an enormous impact on the tenor of the conference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next review is to occur later this month in Copenhagen, and I understand that Australia's policy position will simply reflect the UNEP line on so-called transitional substances, or HCFCs. Earlier this year the Government rejected amendments which the Democrats moved concerning the Ozone Protection Amendment Bill which could have ensured that Australia again took a leading role in the protection of the ozone layer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's weakening of its environmental resolve is also apparent on the domestic front. Most Australians now realise that the Government's commitment to the Toronto target was a political sweetener intended to win over concerned individuals and environment groups. The national greenhouse response strategy has been hijacked by bureaucrats and bears almost no resemblance to the consensus recommendations that arose from last year's ESD process. Incredibly, the bureaucracy believes that only cosmetic changes need to be made to the extremely weak draft that was released a few months ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I will not focus on the Government's failings in this regard. Along with the Opposition, I am delighted that the Government is seeing through a commitment to the comprehensive protection of Antarctica. The Protocol not only prevents mining for 50 years, whereupon the ban may be lifted with the agreement of at least three-quarters of the current consultative parties, but also sets out a list of procedures for environmental impact assessment, for the conservation of Antarctic flora and fauna, for waste disposal and waste management, and for area protection and management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should say a few words on the huskies in Antarctica. Article 4 of annex II to the Protocol states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dogs shall not be introduced onto land or ice shelves and dogs currently in those areas shall be removed by April 1, 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The huskies are an exotic species in Antarctica. Although they provide friendship to many of the people living on the bases, they nevertheless pose a risk to the environment and to indigenous animals such as penguins and baby seals. Australia's strong position on environmental protection would have been compromised by allowing the huskies to remain there until they died from natural causes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only other countries to have huskies in Antarctica are the United Kingdom and Argentina. We understand that the UK is resisting the removal of the dogs and this may impede its ratification of the Treaty. This would in turn become an obstacle for the entry into force of the Protocol. It would be intolerable for Australia to adopt such a position, and it is to be hoped that the UK can be persuaded to alter its position. I understand that the huskies have now gone to a new home in Minnesota, where they will be kept together as working dog teams. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the Australian Democrats fully support this Bill to prohibit mining in Antarctica and to establish a comprehensive protection regime for the Antarctic environment. The Protocol is a landmark in international efforts to protect the global environment and Australia's speedy ratification will help to bring it into force. In taking the steps that we have, Australians have ensured that our children and our grandchildren will have the same opportunity as we have had to know that the earth's coldest, driest, windiest, highest continent still remains a wilderness, even if only a privileged few actually visit there. Just knowing that the integrity of Antarctica will be protected is a cause of deep satisfaction for all of us. The Democrats support the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The irony is that the effect of the Protocol, which claims to protect the Antarctic environment, will be to place the pristine Antarctic environment under greater risk by increasing significantly the use of mechanical vehicles by expeditioners. As we are speaking here today, the Mawson huskies are on the move. In fact, 19 working dogs and three young pups left Antarctica on 4 November this year. They were moved very quickly, with not a lot of publicity. There was a fair amount of publicity in the local press in Hobart but not much anywhere else. They have headed off to Minnesota. The other six dogs that are still at Mawson were considered too old to travel. I guess most of us in this place will be feeling that way by the end of the session. I am led to believe that a decision on their future will be made at the end of 1993-94, if they are still alive. I mean the huskies, not us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The huskies arrived in Hobart on Monday of this week. They were flown to Melbourne on Tuesday. I think they arrived in Los Angeles this morning. From there they will spend 3 1/2 days on a truck, travelling 3,500 kilometres to their new home. They are going to outward bound schools near Ely in Minnesota, which is about 35 kilometres south of the Canadian border, where dog sled teams are still used. That will be a long and totally unnecessary journey. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision to remove the huskies from Antarctica was based on two primary concerns. The first was that the huskies may introduce disease to Antarctica. The second was that the huskies may break free and attack penguin colonies. So what? Both of these concerns have been proved to be unfounded. Firstly, there has been no recorded instance of a Mawson husky acquiring, carrying or transmitting disease. They might have bitten a few of the handlers but they certainly have not done those sorts of things. In fact, after spending the past 40 years isolated in a virtual quarantine situation, it is practically impossible for the huskies to be infected with disease. They are more likely to be infected from the humans than to infect anybody else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, there is no evidence that Antarctica's wildlife is threatened by the presence of the huskies. Reports of huskies breaking free from their leashes and attacking penguin colonies are very rare indeed, not only in regard to Australia but in regard to other Antarctic Treaty nations. In fact, the huskies are trained not to disturb wildlife, let alone to attack it. I read a very good article by a devoted former expeditioner to Antarctica, Mr Patrick Moonie, who was on television a couple of nights ago, pointing out the errors of the Government in making this decision. I think he made quite a good point when he said that, here we are, getting into bed with the French and saying that we have to do all the right things when, at the same time, the French are exploding nuclear devices in the Pacific and are actually bulldozing penguin colonies at their Antarctic station at Dumont d'Urville. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are the only ones, we are the trendsetters, forced by other well-meaning nations, including France, to get our huskies out of Antarctica. In fact we are the only ones who have done so. I am sure that the decision to remove the huskies pleased the radical environmentalists, or the vociferous ill-informed lobby group, as Mr Moonie called them. These zealots, if they had their way, would have us all living in caves again. The decision angered most people, but the ones who were affected most by it were Australia's Antarctic expeditioners themselves. The dogs have been an integral part of the working of the Mawson base for the last 40 years. Their very presence has a very beneficial effect on the morale of the expeditioners, who are separated from their loved ones by a very great distance and who are living in an isolated and remote region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If anybody should know it is Patrick Moonie, who was a member of five expeditions to Antarctica. He quite rightly pointed out the psychological factors of the huskies at Mawson. The huskies are of very great importance. They are the only objects upon which the personnel at this isolated outpost can lavish their affection. That may change now, of course, if we are to send troops down to Antarctica. I am sure that the decisions that have been made recently by the Government as far as homosexuals are concerned would mean that our expeditioners could lavish their affections on things other than dogs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, I think most of us can understand how these expeditioners feel about losing these dogs. Only recently our family dog went missing. One of Duncan Kerr's staff found it for me and brought it back; I thought that was quite good of her. I was talking to Senator Brownhill only yesterday. His family dog drowned in the swimming pool, and I know the effect that has had on his family. I think we can all understand how the expeditioners feel about the premature departure from Antarctica of these wonderful animals. What I cannot understand is the rationale behind the decision to remove the huskies. They are the most efficient means of transport on the continent and they pose no threat to Antarctica's pristine environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When our colleague Senator Richardson was Minister for the environment, he issued a statement that the huskies were no threat to the environment and there were no plans for their removal. What has changed since then? Of course, what has changed since then is the Minister. The huskies are still the same but the Minister has changed. We now know that Mrs Kelly, the Minister, is one of the few Ministers in the history of this Parliament who, when it comes to a dispute, is able to upset every party in the dispute. The recent</PARA>
<PARA>Benders Quarry issue in Tasmania is one such example. It should be no surprise that she has made another poor decision in an attempt to canvass the green vote for the next election. However, what is surprising is the utter contempt shown by Mrs Kelly and her office to the supporters of the huskies in their attempts to discuss the issue with her. I note this article written by Patrick Moonie, where he says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am told that the Minister, Ros Kelly, has received more mail on the husky issue than any other matter, but she has resolutely remained mute to any entreaties and has refused to respond to, let alone acknowledge, correspondence, phone calls or our requests to meet a delegation to discuss the issue.</PARA>
<PARA>Obviously this is a political move&mdash;nothing more, nothing less. The removal of the huskies will downgrade the effectiveness of Australia's Antarctic operations. This is because their function will now be taken over by machines, which will be far more harmful to the environment. Rex Moncur, the Director of the Australian Antarctic Division, has stated in the past that the huskies are a lot less of a threat to the environment in Antarctica than any mechanical vehicle. But the same Rex Moncur, when he went to the meeting in Madrid, was obviously pressured by the Minister to agree to remove the huskies, and I am sure he would privately say that was a very grievous decision he had to make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the huskies have by far the best transport safety record in Antarctica. We know that many machines have been lost by Australia and other Antarctic nations and also that some men's lives have been lost, but Australia has never lost either a dog or any of its attendants. I do not think there is any doubt that this is due to the keen senses of the huskies, which can sense danger in a manner that people in vehicles are not able to. In fact, there have been several reported instances of huskies refusing to travel across icefields which have been found, upon further investigation, to be dangerously thin. If anyone saw the TV documentary the other night, the person being interviewed&mdash;and I think it was Patrick Moonie&mdash;actually quoted a case where the huskies refused to go on. After a lot of coaxing they still would not go on, and when people went forward and had a look they found that the ice was dangerously thin. It would have been a disaster if they had gone on. What is going to happen now when these teams go out with mechanical devices? They will not have the advantage of man's best friend there to help and save them. </PARA>

We should have some pride in the fact that those animals are the descendants of the animals that have been there for 40-odd years. But they were rushed off, bundled onto a truck, travelled 3,500 kilometres in 3 1/2 days&mdash;and they are going to end up in Minnesota. Surely something could have been done to put them to work, even in the Snowy Mountains near Canberra.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At end of motion, add ``, while not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the Senate expresses its grave concern over the decision of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories to remove the Mawson Base huskies from their long-term environment and give them to a resort operator in the United States of America''.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This decision really epitomises the absolutely absurd nonsense which Mrs Kelly goes on with. There is no scientific, practical or logical reason why these dogs are required to be moved from the Antarctic. I asked Senator Collins, the Minister representing Mrs Kelly, whether there was any scientific evidence as to the impact that the husky dogs were having on the ecology of the Antarctic, and Senator Collins responded by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While there is no scientific evidence available on the impact of the Mawson husky dogs on the Antarctic environment and the ecology, there have been numerous incidents of huskies killing penguins which have strayed too close to them or of the dogs breaking free and killing the wildlife.</PARA>
<PARA>That is absolute nonsense. We know that there is no risk of the dogs introducing disease because they have been born and bred and lived their entire lives in the pristine environment of the Antarctic, and there is no history of any Antarctic dogs being infected by disease or conveying disease. To suggest that they are in some way a hazard to the environment is an absolute nonsense. To talk about eating a few penguins that are dopey enough to waddle onto the dog line, as an explanation for removing the dogs, is absurd.

It is interesting that the British have said they have no intention of removing their dogs and their dogs can live the rest of their lives in the Antarctic in the only environment that they know; the world actually will not come to an end and there will be no consequential collapse of humanity as we know it. The British have made it quite clear to the Australians that we can whistle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The very reason that this particular aspect is incorporated in the Protocol is because of this lunatic fringe group of environmentalists who, as far back as the middle and late 1980s when there was no protocol, were insisting that the dogs be removed. I seem to remember reading that one of the Greenpeace women went to the Antarctic and from the bow of the ship she observed the scattered remains of a penguin that had ventured too close to the husky dogs. All she could see were a few feathers and lots of blood&mdash;the inevitable consequence of getting near one of these healthy and hungry dogs.

It is not sentimental to recall the close intrinsic relationship there is between the expeditioners&mdash;and there has been for 40 years&mdash;and the Antarctic dogs, and the fabulous contribution they have made to science.

Many people thought it might undermine the reasonably good agreement toward which we were heading. That was a very significant debate and I can remember being involved in it inside the Party.

I do not think Mrs Kelly is sitting in her office cowering, hoping that I will come forcefully to her defence so she can emerge in public again from these scathing attacks upon her.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that there are arguments of some force that the element of the Treaty which we are seeking to give effect to here, which requires the huskies to be removed, is unnecessary.

It is a very comfortable position to be in to say, `Everybody should agree with the bits we agree with but we claim the right not to comply with the bits with which we disagree'. So, first of all, it is a question of good international citizenship.

We were advised that the UK is committed fully to the implementation of the Madrid Protocol and that the UK does not want to be inflexible on the matter of its dogs in Antarctica and will review its position before the 1994 deadline.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Calvert and others will know that, whilst I was involved in the early part of this debate in the party room, I have not been as centrally involved as Minister Kelly, but my advice is that the judgment made by advisers and ultimately by the Minister on their advice was that, if they were to be removed&mdash;that was the first decision and I think that was made for the reasons I have outlined&mdash;then the best location for those dogs, in their interests, was the Minnesota location; that was where they should go, in their interests; and therefore, if we did not take up the opportunity, it would not recur. It was not a question of saying, `We do not want to send them to Minnesota until a bit later. We would like them to stay where they are a bit longer'.

The only voice of dissent from the Government was heard in a paper prepared in Mr Keating's office which criticised the regime. That was the only indication by the Government that it opposed the minerals regime and supported this Treaty.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill implements an enhanced disclosure system for corporations and other entities in which members of the public invest. It requires a new form of ongoing or continuous disclosure of information of interest to investors, as well as improving the present system for periodic reporting, in particular by requiring a half yearly financial report. In light of this enhanced level of disclosure of information in relation to investment entities, the Bill introduces a number of reforms to facilitate the issue of prospectuses by these entities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Financial Impact</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Provision has been made for the additional costs which will be incurred by the Australian Securities Commission in administering the enhanced disclosure system. The Attorney-General announced in August that the necessary additional expenditure of $3.2m over the next 4 years had been approved in the context of the Budget. This will cover upgrading of the Commission's computer system, as well as ongoing administrative costs for this period. However, the Commission expects that the running costs included in this figure will be substantially offset by revenue raised through charges for additional access to its national database.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further details and an assessment of the financial impact of the Bill on business is contained in the Explanatory Memorandum. In essence, some additional costs can be expected for business, although these should not be significant for entities which are listed on the Australian Stock Exchange or which, consistent with good governance practices, already have internal reporting systems in place. Furthermore, the reforms to the prospectus provisions will result in savings for these entities when they engage in fundraising.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">History of the Bill</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the Government considers it is essential that there be timely disclosure of relevant information about the financial position and prospects of entities in which Australians invest. It is essential to enable informed judgments on investment decisions, whether made by individual Australians or by large institutional investors. In every case the principle is the same&mdash;disclosure of relevant information about an investment and access to such information, either directly or through advisers, is necessary to ensure an equitable and efficient investment system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It seems likely that the 1990s will see an increase in activity on the part of shareholders in monitoring, and in taking direct action concerning, the governance of their companies. Effective and soundly based action by shareholders is enhanced if they have access to all material information about their companies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the importance of adequate disclosure goes beyond this. An effective disclosure system will often be a significant inhibition on questionable corporate conduct. Knowledge that such conduct will be quickly exposed to the glare of publicity, as well as criticism by shareholders and the financial press, makes it less likely to occur in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In essence, a well informed market leads to greater investor confidence and in turn to a greater willingness to invest in Australian business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is commonly acknowledged that the frequent lack of disclosure of significant information was a major shortcoming of our corporate regulatory system in the 1980s. Failure to address this shortcoming would be an abdication of our responsibility to Australian investors. It is not sufficient to say, as some have, that the problem of adequate disclosure is not as great today. Our regulatory framework must be capable of meeting the challenges which will emerge with the next period of major stock market activity&mdash;at which point there is a risk that the cautionary experiences of the past will be put to one side. Furthermore, there are concerns about the present level of corporate disclosure which a legislative regime will address.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Against this background, the Attorney-General asked the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee in June last year to report, as a matter of high priority, on the need for a statutory system of ongoing reporting by listed companies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In welcoming the Committee's report in October last year, the Attorney-General noted the wide ranging nature of the Committee's recommendations, as well as its impact on the business community, and asked his Department to consult with interested parties, especially business, in relation to its implementation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There followed a process of detailed consultation with business and professional groups, both through written submissions and also numerous meetings with representatives of these groups and individual experts. It is fair to say that considerable criticism was made of the Advisory Committee's proposal for legislation&mdash;both as to the need for legislation at all, and as to the scope and potentially onerous nature of the recommended disclosure system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In light of the consultative process undertaken by the Attorney-General and his Department, the legislative outline announced by the Government in July this year differed in a number of significant respects from the scheme recommended by the Committee. The changes involved a substantial narrowing of the range of entities to be subject to the statutory system so that it will now only apply to those entities in which investors have a direct interest because their securities are traded or offered for sale in the marketplace. In addition, the scheme put forward by the Government involved a reformulation of the ongoing disclosure obligations to ensure a less onerous and more cost effective system. In announcing the scheme, it was emphasised that these obligations would be framed so as not to involve the imposition of `due diligence' obligations applicable to the issue of a one-off prospectus for raising funds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since July, the Attorney-General's Department has again engaged in a very intensive process of consultation with business and professional organisations in developing the draft legislation. Four detailed issues papers prepared by the Department provided a basis for a series of meetings with representatives of these organisations and a number of individuals. The constructive approach adopted during this consultation process was most valuable from the Government's perspective and has contributed significantly to the draft Bill. The consultation process has been welcomed also by the business sector, especially because of the opportunity provided for their input at a stage prior to the adoption of firm policy positions by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Context of the Bill</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before dealing with the Bill in more detail, I want to stress three points.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, the Government is committed to a legislative scheme for enhanced disclosure. It does not believe that this is a matter which can satisfactorily be left to the discretion of the entities themselves or to the Stock Exchange in respect of listed entities. With the enhanced role envisaged for the Australian Securities Commission, legislative requirements will have greater force and effect than stock exchange rules. And it is appropriate that obligations with civil and criminal consequences of the kind involved here be contained in legislation&mdash;rather than in stock exchange rules which are, in essence, a private contract between the exchange and listed entities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second point I need to emphasize is the Government's ongoing commitment to consultation on the detail of the legislative requirements, prior to the Bill's enactment. It is intended that debate on this Bill be deferred for a period of 3 months to enable public comment and consultation. At each of the previous two stages of consultation undertaken by the Government, significant changes have been made to meet the justifiable concerns of business. If any further justifiable concerns are identified, these too will be met. The Government will be looking for constructive input and suggestions from business and professional experts in order to ensure that, once enacted, the legislation will be effective in achieving the objective of enhanced disclosure, in a cost efficient and commercially practicable manner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, I draw attention to the fact that the Bill provides for the disclosure provisions in Part 2 of the Bill to commence on 31 December 1993. This will give affected entities ample time to put in place any new procedures and reporting systems necessary to enable compliance with the new periodic reporting and continuous disclosure requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Content of the Bill</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now want to outline a few of the most important features of the Bill. I will deal first with the reforms arising from the enhanced disclosure scheme. A more detailed outline of this scheme is set out in the Explanatory Memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Enhanced Disclosure</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) Entities to be covered</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The major application of the enhanced disclosure scheme will be to entities listed on the Australian Stock Exchange and to other entities which raise funds in circumstances in which a prospectus is required to be lodged. Entities subject to the new system are referred to as disclosing entities. Applying the disclosure scheme to those entities which have to prepare a prospectus or which are listed provides a direct connection with investors who have an interest in timely disclosure of material information. An exception is provided where, for example, the number of shareholders or the number of unitholders in a trust falls below 50&mdash;in which case an entity will cease to be a disclosing entity. Flexibility is provided to enable a complete or partial exemption from the enhanced disclosure system for particular entities, through the making of regulations or by way of an Australian Securities Commission order. These exemptions may be made subject to conditions. In particular, consideration will be given to the desirability of an exemption for those foreign entities whose special position is already recognised by the Australian Securities Commission and the Stock Exchange.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be noted that the entities covered by the scheme include those referred to in the Corporations Law as `prescribed interests'. This category of investment is presently being examined by the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee and the Australian Law Reform Commission as part of their review of `Collective Investments'. The approach adopted in the Bill on disclosure in relation to these investments is along the lines of that foreshadowed by these bodies in their review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Enhanced periodic reporting</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The major change to the Corporations Law for periodic reporting is the new requirement for a statutory half yearly report. The purpose of this report will be to provide financial details and a review of half yearly operations, in a manner which corresponds to existing annual reports. However, the reporting will not be as detailed as for annual reports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Accounting Standards Board will, as a result of the Bill, have power to make accounting standards for the purposes of the half yearly reports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reports will be subject to review by a qualified auditor to give an additional level of assurance as to their compliance with the requirements of the Law. The review will not, however, require the level of enquiry or the expense involved with the audit undertaken for annual reports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Additional annual reporting requirements, analogous to those applicable at present to companies, will be introduced for disclosing entities which are not now subject to them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) Continuous Disclosure</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The single most important reform contained in the Bill is the requirement for disclosing entities to report to the Australian Securities Commission, on an ongoing or continuous basis, matters of significance concerning these entities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Disclosure will be required to the Australian Securities Commission of material information as soon as practicable, but in any event within 3 days of an event or a change in circumstances. The overriding requirement is that disclosure be made as soon as practicable within this timeframe.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In view of its extensive investigation and enforcement powers, the Australian Securities Commission is well placed to take action designed to ensure a high level of compliance. In addition, significant new civil remedies will be provided to enable an investor who suffers loss as a result of non-disclosure to recover that loss from the disclosing entity. Where an individual, such as a director, a senior company officer or an outside expert, is knowingly involved in a contravention of the disclosure requirements, that person will also be liable. In addition, a company officer whose action exposes the company to liability for breach of the continuous disclosure provisions may well be liable to the company for not discharging the usual duty of care and diligence owed to the company. Adoption of this form of personal liability for directors and professional advisers addresses a concern raised by business interests regarding the liability attaching to the scheme, whilst at the same time providing an appropriate incentive for compliance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The criteria to be used in determining whether disclosure of a matter is required will be based, in essence, on what a reasonable investor would expect to be disclosed. It adopts the tests presently used by the Corporations Law in determining the information to be included in a prospectus and by the Australian Stock Exchange in its Listing Rule dealing with ongoing disclosure by listed entities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consistency with these tests is an important element of the new scheme. It will thus be possible for the disclosure test to be applied in a commercially sensible manner, with a level of familiarity on the part of many users and advisers. However, there is an important difference from its use in relation to prospectuses. A number of features of the continuous disclosure scheme are designed to ensure that `due diligence', in the sense this term is used in respect of prospectuses, is not a part of continuous disclosure. Thus, the element of `reasonable enquiries' in the prospectus provisions is not incorporated for continuous disclosure. There is a defence for an entity which establishes a reasonable disclosure system designed to enable compliance with the legislation. Such systems are already common in major entities and are regarded as an essential part of corporate governance. Their existence should in many cases enable compliance without additional cost. For entities without such a system, it will be a defence to show that disclosure would not have been achieved had there been a reasonable system in operation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These features, together with the approach taken in respect of criminal and civil liability, reflect the Government's desire to have a scheme which, while having statutory force, is capable of being administered by entities in a commercially reasonable manner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A defence is also provided where an entity does not wish to disclose confidential information. This issue raises difficult considerations. On the one hand, entities in certain circumstances may be justified in withholding information, the release of which would prejudice the entity. On the other hand, it is necessary to ensure that excessive and improper use of a `confidentiality' exception does not undermine the success of the disclosure scheme as a whole. In this regard, it is worth noting that one of the criticisms of the present level of disclosure relates to the reliance on claims of confidentiality to justify non-disclosure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The exception which has been included in the Bill reflects both the commercial need for confidential information to be withheld and the desire to avoid potential abuse. It establishes an objective test which enables non-disclosure where a disclosing entity can establish that disclosure would result in an unreasonable prejudice to the entity. This test reflects the fact that the confidentiality of particular information and the consequences of its disclosure is a matter which the entity itself is in the best position to establish.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The continuous disclosure obligations are contained in approximately two pages in the Bill and result from the use of general principles in the drafting. This approach has the major benefit of enabling reliance on tests of what is reasonable in the circumstances. These tests are thus objective in nature and provide appropriate guidance, in easily understood language, for disclosing entities, officers and professional advisers. Furthermore, it can be expected, consistent with the usual approach of the courts in these matters, that judges will not seek to second guess, with the benefit of hindsight, judgments by company officers which were reasonable at the time and in the circumstances of their making.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The role of the Australian Stock Exchange in supervising listed entities is an important one and care has been taken in drafting the legislation to enable this role to be preserved and enhanced. The enhancement of the Australian Stock Exchange's role is achieved in part by a provision which will make it clear that the Exchange is protected by qualified privilege in carrying out its disclosure and supervisory functions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The enactment of legislation requiring ongoing disclosure should not be seen as a criticism of the Stock Exchange. It has been generally recognized that the level of disclosure by listed entities achieved by the Stock Exchange has improved significantly in recent times. However, the Government believes that legislation will ensure that these gains are maintained and improved upon. In addition, the legislation will, of course, apply to a significant number of unlisted entities. It would not be appropriate to have a legislative framework for these unlisted entities, while applying a different system, based only on contractual obligations in Listing Rules, to listed entities in which there is a major investor interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is to be hoped that the Stock Exchange Rules and the legislation can complement one another. From the Government's perspective, close co-operation between the Australian Stock Exchange and the Australian Securities Commission would be expected to significantly enhance the overall level of corporate disclosure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) Prospectus Reforms</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As has been indicated previously, the introduction of a statutory disclosure scheme provides scope for streamlining the existing prospectus requirements. The enhanced level of information available to investors on an ongoing basis in respect of disclosing entities means that in many circumstances adequate investor protection can be achieved without requiring information about the disclosing entity to be repeated in a prospectus.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reform in this area is based in part on a report in March 1992 by a Sub-Committee of the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee, which was convened specifically to review the prospectus provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Sub-Committee's report noted its support for the concept of continuous disclosure. This Bill deals with the major recommendation relating to rights issues by the Sub-Committee, as well as some other reforms, which relate directly to the introduction of an enhanced disclosure scheme. Some additional reforms to the prospectus provisions, including the remainder of those in the Sub-Committee report, will be dealt with at a later stage during 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For disclosing entities which meet certain criteria related to the level of information available about the entity, there will be four significant reforms:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, for primary offers of quoted securities (in particular, rights issues) by qualifying disclosing entities, the requirement to lodge a prospectus will be satisfied by lodgment of a limited prospectus which provides information relating to the offer. The approach adopted in this regard is based on that recommended by the Sub-Committee, although the precise test has been derived from the present prospectus test in the Corporations Law. The essential aim is to obtain the inclusion of information relating to the offer of securities which would be required to be included in a prospectus, while not requiring information about the entity which should already be available through the enhanced disclosure system.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second change will significantly streamline the present requirements for a secondary prospectus where an offer of securities is made by a seller other than the corporation which issued the securities. Whether such a document should continue to be dealt with as a prospectus is a matter which will be examined during the second stage of reforms, in the context of proposals that have been made for the adoption of a narrower definition of the term `prospectus'.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The third prospectus reform will enable the incorporation by reference into a prospectus of material in documents lodged with the Australian Securities Commission by a disclosing entity, subject to certain safeguards.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fourth reform will extend the life of prospectuses in certain cases from 6 to 12 months. This reform is justified also by the requirement for a supplementary prospectus to be lodged where there is a significant change in circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The entities which will qualify for relief from the current prospectus requirements under these reforms will be those which meet certain criteria designed to provide a level of assurance as to the information available in the market place about the entity. For this reason those entities which are subject to an exemption of one kind or another from the disclosure provisions will not automatically be entitled to operate under this streamlined system. To ensure that the system operates in a reasonable and flexible manner, in cases where an exemption results in no material adverse effects for the level of information available to investors, the ASC will be empowered to specify that an entity may nevertheless have the benefit of the proposed prospectus relief.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The present exemption from the accounts provisions in the Corporations Law for certain banks and life insurance companies requires special mention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The relevant provisions take account of the overlapping requirements in the Banking and Life Insurance legislation dealing with the provision of financial information by banks and life insurance companies and are designed to avoid duplication. The Bill extends the present provisions in respect of the periodic disclosure requirements, where applicable. However, the justification for the continued operation of these provisions may be questionable, having regard to the `investor protection' rationale for the enhanced disclosure scheme and the new prospectus provisions. The Attorney-General therefore proposes to establish, in consultation with the Treasurer, a working group of officials to review the current exemption and make recommendations on any changes that are required. It is envisaged that the Reserve Bank of Australia, the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, the Australian Securities Commission and the Australian Accounting Standards Board would be involved in this review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Other Reforms</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An important reform will be made to the Corporations Law to clarify and relax the present prohibition on a company's ability to insure and indemnify its officers (including directors) and its auditors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The existing prohibition has long been criticised, both for its uncertain scope and its lack of consistency with appropriate commercial practice. Reports have been made by both the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee and its predecessor, the Companies and Securities Law Review Committee, recommending that the prohibition be relaxed. In formulating the reforms, regard has been had to the somewhat different recommendations in the two reports, as well as to the position in several common law jurisdictions overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In essence, the reforms proposed will operate as follows:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A company or a related company will not be prohibited from indemnifying an officer or auditor of the company against liability incurred by the person in that capacity provided the liability arises to a third party and does not involve a lack of good faith. Existing provisions allowing indemnities in respect of costs incurred in legal actions will be preserved.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A company or a related company will not be prohibited from taking out insurance to benefit an officer or auditor of the company provided the liability does not involve a wilful breach of duty to the company or the gaining of an improper advantage, as defined in the Corporations Law. Insurance will also be possible to cover the costs of legal actions brought against officer and auditors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In other circumstances, restrictions will remain on companies indemnifying, exempting or insuring their officers or auditors. It should be noted, however, that the definition of officer will be narrowed to exclude any restrictions on payments for the benefit of employees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of important safeguards are designed to ensure that these provisions will not be subject to abuse. In particular, disclosure will be required in a company's annual report of indemnities and insurance policies taken out for the benefit of company officers and auditors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Furthermore, the usual principles requiring a company officer to act in the best interests of the company will apply to decisions to indemnify (or agree to do so) and to take out insurance for officers. Similarly, the provisions to be inserted in the Corporations Law by the Corporate Law Reform Bill which was introduced earlier this month and which dealt with remuneration of officers of public companies, will apply to payments of insurance premiums and indemnities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In summary, this provision is designed to achieve a reasonable balance between providing flexibility for companies to act in an appropriate, commercial manner and the need to ensure that shareholders' funds are not used improperly to benefit directors and officers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I note that the Business Council of Australia and the Australian Institute of Company Directors were closely involved in, and indeed contributed significantly to, the development of the policy reflected in the proposed amendments. These two organisations have welcomed the approach reflected in the revised provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other reform contained in the Bill will overcome a problem encountered with the use of documents from the Australian Securities Commission's national database as evidence in court proceedings. The proposed amendment follows discussion of this issue with the Chairman of the Australian Securities Commission and the Ministerial Council for Corporations. It will enable a document from the database to be admissible in a court proceeding as prima facie evidence of the matters stated, without the need for certification of the document.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Conclusion</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this is the second major Corporate Law Reform Bill introduced in the Senate this month. As was indicated in introducing the first Bill, the enactment of these two Bills will complete a major stage in the Government's ongoing corporate law reform program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An important part of the next stage, which will involve simplification and modernisation of corporate law, will be a review of the rules applicable to companies operated by small business. This review will be carried out in light of the recommendations of the report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Corporations and Securities, which is expected to table its report on the Close Corporations Act 1989 next month.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As indicated earlier, it is proposed that debate on the present Bill be deferred for 3 months to enable public consultation on its content. In accordance with the Heads of Agreement between the Commonwealth, the States and the Northern Territory on corporate regulation, the Ministerial Council for Corporations has approved the introduction of the Bill into Parliament on this basis, subject to the usual consultation and approval process taking place with the Council prior to the debate on the Bill.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to take the opportunity, very briefly, on the first reading of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) to raise a matter generally about taxation and the continuing taxation that this Government imposts upon business particularly in Australia. The Taxation Laws Amendment (Car Parking) Bill has already been dealt with in this Parliament, but because I had some other parliamentary duties last night when this matter was raised I did not get the opportunity to mention some matters about the difficulties which the fringe benefits tax on car parking facilities will impose upon various people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 4 November 1992 I raised in the adjournment debate how this particular fringe benefits tax would impost on local authorities around Australia, and I particularly mentioned the Melbourne City Council, which had very strong reservations about the Bill. I indicated that in that instance and in the instance of many other capital cities and major provincial cities the effect of this Bill would be to move many businesses away from the central business area and would leave underutilised much of the infrastructure that has already been put in place. It is something that local authorities around Australia are very concerned about and very strongly oppose because of the impact it will have on them and, as well, because of the additional revenue they will have to find, in many cases, to pay this tax. I will not repeat the things I said in that speech but I do make reference to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to mention some letters that I and many of my colleagues have received. I make specific reference to a letter I received from the Brisbane Parking Industry Association which provides quite a deal of information. Very briefly, I indicate some of the points raised by that association in opposing this Bill. The central business district employees are already penalised and they are disadvantaged because they must pay parking costs. Employers are already heavily taxed through sales tax, income tax, capital gains taxes and other State taxes, including payroll tax, and they have been hit with other additional costs&mdash;training levies and superannuation costs&mdash;all of which will be removed under the next Hewson Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The letter goes on to say that many employers have been hit by staggering State land taxes. They are paying double and triple the amounts they were paying just a few years ago. The tax payable on parking would have a significant effect on employers in labour intensive industries. It is a sectional tax. A financial burden of major proportions for many employers would result and it would create enormous administrative costs. It would also, the Association points out, jeopardise the Better Cities program by forcing development out of the cities. Of course, that is a program that this Government is interested in. It would force employers to cut costs and jobs and the tax would get higher and higher. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, I want to make reference to a letter on the same subject that was sent to me by the Townsville Chamber of Commerce and to quote from that letter. The Townsville Chamber of Commerce points out that the proposed legislation imposes yet another unnecessary tax impost on business. It points out that any business within approximately two kilometres of the Townsville Post Office, including manufacturers, wholesalers and businesses in the south Townsville area, will be charged at least $200 per annum for each car parking space provided to most employees, including employees using their own cars. It points out that the tax is inequitable. It is even charged where the employee is required to use his or her own car for business purposes during the day. It further points out that the tax is discriminatory, that businesses located near the city heart which provide employee parking will have to pay the tax, while those located elsewhere providing exactly the same facilities will not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Townsville Chamber of Commerce rightly points out that in relation to Townsville&mdash;and this would apply in many other provincial cities as well&mdash;this tax ignores the fact that provincial cities such as Townsville lack adequate public transport as an alternative to driving to work. That is something that I do not think the Government has taken into account seriously enough. The Chamber rightly points out that it will impose considerably more paperwork on business. The legislation provides for exemption on any day the employee does not park his vehicle for four hours overall&mdash;not continuously, that is. The exemption does not, however, go far enough. There will be many situations where an employee will be required to use his or her vehicle at times during the day and still be parked for more than four hours. In practice, the cost of maintaining time records to monitor this will outweigh any potential benefit, meaning employees will have to pay unnecessarily to save money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the car parking FBT has to be imposed, an option should be allowed of basing it on the percentage non-business use of the vehicle where a log book has been kept. The rationale for the tax&mdash;if one applies at all&mdash;certainly does not apply in provincial cities. I ask the Government very seriously to consider that. Employers will be unnecessarily penalised for the trouble and cost of providing parking for employees who do not have the extensive public transport system available to their counterparts in the capital cities. I understand that the Taxation Laws Amendment (Car Parking) Bill, which I am not talking to but simply referring very obliquely to, has been referred to a committee for further consideration. I hope the Committee will take into account the matters I have just raised. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ENDANGERED SPECIES PROTECTION BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the past few years this Government has publicly shown a strong commitment to the protection of endangered species. A vital component of this position has been a public commitment to the consideration of the enactment of Commonwealth endangered species legislation. This Bill is the result of that commitment, and will form the legislative component of the Government's ongoing action to protect endangered species.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill is also in response to the widespread view expressed by the Australian public that endangered species are a national problem that requires Commonwealth Government involvement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Extinction of species is, of course, a natural part of the evolutionary process. However, in the 200 years since European settlement the rate of extinction in Australia has accelerated dramatically.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This increase is not, as some believe, an event associated only with the early days of settlement when our scientific knowledge of the Australian environment and our impacts on it were far more limited than they are today. Extinctions and endangered species are very much a current problem. Half of all our animal extinctions have occurred this century.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Scientists agree that Australia has right now 226 species and sub-species of plants and 73 of animals which are endangered, that is, they are in immediate danger of extinction. A further 661 species and sub-species of plants and 66 of animals are vulnerable: that is, they are likely to become endangered if present threats continue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the international level also, the Bill will demonstrate that Australia is taking action to address endangered species conservation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are not alone in our efforts to save endangered species. Many other countries, including Japan and the United States, have already taken legislative action to protect endangered species, with the need already reflected within the recently concluded Convention on Biological Diversity and Agenda 21 of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Within Australia, a number of States and Territories have introduced, or are in the process of introducing endangered species legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All of this action only makes it more important for the Commonwealth Government to proceed with the enactment of its own endangered species legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Endangered species do not recognise State boundaries. What is needed for their proper protection and management is a national perspective. We need nationally agreed lists of what species are endangered and vulnerable, and a national approach to plans for their recovery.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of course, it is essential that the lists are prepared on a scientific basis and that the scientists advising the Minister are free to make their decisions without the pressure of other influences on their decision making.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The development of the legislation has been subject to extensive consultation over a long period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation was first mooted by the Government in March 1990. The Endangered Species Advisory Committee provided the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories with an options paper on endangered species legislation in April 1991. A public consultation process was begun in early 1992 with the release of a paper: "Commonwealth Endangered Species Legislation&mdash;The Proposal".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Extensive consultation with all relevant interest groups including industry, conservation organisations and the States and Territories followed during the development of the Bill. The legislation was adjusted to take into account the legitimate concerns of industry and conservation groups, while still maintaining its integrity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill addresses such fundamental issues as the scientific process for listing endangered and vulnerable species and the development of recovery and threat abatement plans for their protection.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The major focus of the legislation is its positive and proactive approach to endangered species and their long term survival in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some critics, having focused on the regulatory aspects, which are in reality of limited extent, appear to have overlooked its predominantly positive approach.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation has the following key features:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.National lists of endangered and vulnerable species and endangered ecological communities. These lists will be determined on purely scientific grounds. Key threatening processes will also be listed. The initial lists are schedules to the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Recovery and threat abatement plans, which must be developed for listed species on Commonwealth lands and waters, and which can be developed co-operatively between the States and Commonwealth for State areas to enable the recovery process to be coordinated on a national basis. Development of recovery and threat abatement plans will include public consultation and the Environment Minister will also consult with other Ministers where the plans concern matters for which they are responsible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.An advisory committee will be established to provide the Environment Minister with advice on the administration of the legislation, including the times within which and priorities for the preparation of recovery and threat abatement plans.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.A scientific subcommittee will also be established (in consultation with relevant Ministers) to advise the Environment Minister on amendments to the lists established under the legislation, and to advise the Minister of the criteria that should be used in deciding whether a list should be amended.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.The Bill contains provisions for the establishment of voluntary conservation agreements between the Commonwealth and persons having interests in Commonwealth areas. These will assist in ensuring the implementation of the recovery and threat abatement plans and the objects of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.The Bill also makes provision for the Environment Minister, in an emergency situation, to place interim conservation orders on activities threatening a listed species or community on Commonwealth lands and waters. In cases where an interim conservation order is to be applied to an act carried out primarily for a commercial purpose, the legislation provides for other relevant Ministers to take emergency action where this is possible using their own powers rather than the Environment Minister having to act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Permanent conservation orders can also be applied on Commonwealth lands and waters. These will be made with the approval of Cabinet as will the extension of any interim conservation order applying to activities carried out primarily for commercial purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.There is also provision for impact assessment conservation orders which the Environment Minister can apply in order to ensure the protection of species where projects are undergoing environmental impact assessment. These orders will only apply for the duration of the impact assessment process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Enforcement and permit provisions are included to control the taking of listed species in Commonwealth areas, and also to ensure conservation orders are complied with.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.The legislation enables interested persons to apply to the Federal Court for an injunction in respect of conduct by the Minister for the Environment or the Director of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service that contravenes the Act (other than matters concerning the listing process and the making of permanent conservation orders).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill has been developed in the context of Ecologically Sustainable Development (ESD) and it accords with the basic principles of ESD. It is obvious that the extinction of species through human intervention is inconsistent with the principles of ESD.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principles of ESD have been mentioned specifically in provisions for the preparation and implementation of recovery and threat abatement plans and the making of conservation orders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We all must remember that once a species is lost, it is lost forever. But there is much we can do to prevent that. Recovery plans which are such a key element of this legislation have a vital role to play but so too do the provisions for control of listed key threats such as fox predation and the die back fungus Phytophthora.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These matters need to be tackled on a national scale, and this legislation will provide us with a framework that will help us get on with the job.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the Government believes that the Bill demonstrates that Australia can conserve endangered species and have development as well. Australians want their environment, and the economy too. This legislation does that.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ENDANGERED SPECIES PROTECTION (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill is associated with the Endangered Species Protection Bill 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill clarifies the circumstances in which endangered species considerations trigger environment assessment under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974. There are also amendments to the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975 to enable the Director of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service to carry out duties specified in the Endangered Species Protection Bill.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 6) 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will amend the taxation laws in a number of respects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It includes measures to implement changes announced in the 1992-93 Budget, as well as changes to the Prescribed Payments System announced by the Treasurer in July.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Budget announcements to be given effect by this Bill are changes to tax deduction arrangements for occupational clothing, changes to dividend streaming arrangements, and new arrangements to treat limited partnerships as companies for tax purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other minor amendments proposed by the Bill relate to the gifts provisions and consequential amendments following the introduction of the family payment advance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I turn now to a more detailed discussion of these measures. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Occupational clothing</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will give effect to the Budget decision to deny a tax deduction for expenses incurred in relation to certain corporate uniforms or wardrobes. This measure will ensure that the taxation laws do not confer an unfair advantage on some employees by permitting tax deductions for clothing which may not be essentially different from that worn to work by other employees for which no deductions are allowed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effect of the amendment is that employees will only be able to claim tax deductions for expenses incurred in purchasing, cleaning and repairing items that comprise a uniform or corporate wardrobe where the wearing of such clothing is expressly required by the employer as a condition of employment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has decided to target more closely the areas of potential abuse in this area. The Government will not prevent non-compulsory uniforms or wardrobes from being deductible in cases where the clothing is clearly identifiable as a corporate wardrobe. The Treasurer will develop strict guidelines to establish whether noncompulsory uniforms or wardrobes, as sets of clothing, are eligible for taxation deduction. These guidelines, which will be published as soon as possible after this Bill receives Royal Assent, will prevent the clear cases of abuse of the existing requirements that have come to the Government's attention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government proposes to amend the Bill in Committee stage of its passage to give effect to this proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important to note that the new rules will not operate to deny a deduction for clothing worn to protect employees from injury, or their normal clothing from damage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The savings cannot be estimated at this stage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of the changes to the Budget announcements the Government has decided to postpone the implementation of these measures until 1 July 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Dividend streaming arrangements</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill gives effect to the announcement in this year's Budget that the income tax law is to be amended to ensure that the dividend streaming provisions work as intended when applied to international dividend streaming arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The changes affect only those companies that are a party to international dividend streaming arrangements. The vast majority of companies will not be affected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will result in a resident company being able to preserve a portion of its available franking credits to be offset against the franking debit that arises under the dividend streaming provisions when a non-resident associate pays a related dividend under the streaming arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This change will apply to franked dividends paid by resident companies on or after the date the Bill receives Royal Assent and will have an insignificant impact on revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Taxation of limited partnerships as companies</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As announced in the 1992-93 Budget, limited partnerships formed on or after 19 August 1992 will be subject to the same taxation provisions as companies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposal is consistent with the Government's equity objectives for the taxation system. The Government has taken measures before to ensure business structures comparable to companies are accorded comparable tax treatment. In 1985, provisions were introduced to ensure public trading trusts were taxed as companies. The previous Government had introduced similar measures in relation to corporate unit trusts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A limited partnership has more in common with a company than with a conventional partnership. Where partners in a conventional partnership are individually and collectively liable to meet partnership debt and make good partnership losses, the liability of limited partners is limited (generally to their investment).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Limited partnerships formed prior to 19 August 1992 will be subject to the same taxation provisions as companies from the 1995-96 year of income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Limited partnerships formed prior to 19 August 1992 may continue to be treated as partnerships for taxation purposes until the 1995-96 year of income. If they do not continue to carry on the same business, or if their ownership changes beyond a limited extent, they will be treated as companies for the year of income in which they change and all later years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Limited partnerships that are subject to the new arrangements will be known as corporate limited partnerships.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new arrangements are likely to have a revenue benefit; however, a reliable estimate cannot be made. This is because in some States legislation authorising the formation of limited partnerships has been enacted only recently.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Prescribed Payments System</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also contains the amendments to the Prescribed Payments System which were announced by the Treasurer on 1 July 1992. The amendments are designed to reduce the administrative burden on payers, payees and the ATO.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments, which will not directly affect the revenue, replace the current monthly reporting arrangements for payers with annual reporting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments proposed will also modify the current arrangements for deduction variation and exemption certificates and approvals to quote reporting exemption numbers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Gifts</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The gift provisions of the income tax law are being amended to reflect a change in name of the College of Pathologists of Australia to the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia. The change will have no impact on revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Exemption for income tax of family payment advance</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From 1 January 1993 the recipients of family payment will be able to have the payment made in a lump sum up to six months in advance. This Bill will amend the income tax law to exempt the family payment advance from income tax. As the regular instalments of family payment are already exempt from income tax there is no cost to revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the Explanatory Memorandum which contains more detailed explanations of the provisions of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">MEDICARE LEVY AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will amend the Medicare Levy Act 1986 to increase the rate of Medicare levy as announced in the Budget Statement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For 1993-94 the rate of Medicare levy will be increased by 0.15 percentage point to 1.4 per cent of taxable income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is proposed to amend the PAYE schedules to take account of the increase in the levy from 1 July 1993. All taxpayers who are liable to pay the levy and who have it deducted in PAYE instalments will be affected from that date. Other taxpayers will be affected on assessment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The benefit to revenue of the increase in the levy is estimated to be $300m in 1993-94. The increase will fund outlay measures for health and aged care announced in the Budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will also make a minor technical amendment to the Medicare Levy Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The explanatory Memorandum accompanying this Bill contains more detailed explanation of the provisions of this Bill.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate has before it once again a package of taxation Bills. I intend to confine my remarks to Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) and Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) and the Income Tax (Dividends and Interest Withholding Tax) Amendment Bill, which is complementary to Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) as it legislates for the 30 per cent tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taxation Laws Amendment Bills (No. 5) and (No. 6) cover a series of taxation measures, many of which have been announced in the Budget. As with many other tax Bills being debated under this guillotine organised with the Australian Democrats, however, I would like to register my protest against the guillotine in operation. The 20 minutes allotted to me to speak today is barely enough to cover the details of one aspect of these Bills, let alone 18 different significant changes in Bill No. 5 and six significant changes in No. 6. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian taxpayers were exhorted by the Federal Government, in the Budget, to ensure that their work and management practices maximised the productivity of existing resources and to embrace new technologies and management philosophies. Everybody applauded this. In particular, companies were encouraged to adopt international benchmarking to identify the areas in which their work and management practices could be improved as compared with world best practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately for the Australian taxpayer, the cost of pursuing the aforementioned objectives has been made all the more expensive in many cases by another Budget measure. The introduction of a final withholding tax of 30 per cent on royalty payments to non-residents&mdash;reduced to 10 per cent in the case of most tax treaty partners&mdash;will force many Australian taxpayers to pay at least that much more for the know-how, technology and equipment which they require to achieve world best practice. The definition of a royalty in the Income Tax Assessment Act is broad enough to encompass payments for the use of all of these items.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Background</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to royalties paid to a resident of a country with which Australia has a double tax agreement where the royalty is derived in carrying on business in Australia through a permanent establishment, the explanatory memorandum to the Bill specifies that such royalties would be treated as "business income" such that the tax liability would continue to be determined by assessment at normal rates of tax, rather than pursuant to the withholding tax system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to apply from the commencement of the 1993-94 income year are to be effected by the extension of the current machinery provisions for the collection of interest and dividend withholding tax&mdash;Div 4 of Pt VI of the ITAA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That interest derived by a permanent establishment of a non-resident is subject to tax by assessment, and not by the withholding tax mechanism, is a result of it being specifically exempted from withholding tax under s128B(3)(h)(ii) and that it is not made exempt income by s128D.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, unfranked dividends derived through the permanent establishment of a non-resident (other than in relation to dividends derived from the assets included in the insurance funds of a non-resident life assurance company), continue to be subject to withholding tax as there is no specific exemption for them under s128B(3), and as such they are otherwise exempt by s128D.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Comment</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The drafter of the explanatory memorandum must have assumed that royalties derived by the permanent establishment of a treaty partner resident, by falling out of the royalties article and into the "business profits" article, would thereby not be subject to Australian withholding tax, since to achieve that result under the domestic law it would have been necessary to introduce a provision such as s128B(3)(h)(ii) as applies to interest derived by the permanent establishment of a non-resident.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The "business profits" articles of Australia's double tax agreements are inconsistent with the denial of deductions to permanent establishments that flow under the domestic law, by unfranked dividends and from 1993-94, royalties (both subject to withholding tax), being exempt income by s128D.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such a treaty partner resident will be able to assert pursuant to s4(2) of the Income Tax (International Agreements) Act, that the "business profits" article is inconsistent with the domestic law, so as to allow the relevant deductions by assessment. But this would not appear to relieve the payer of the royalty from the obligation to withhold tax and remit it to the Tax Office within the prescribed time according to the withholding tax provisions. Any excess tax withheld should be refunded after assessment of an annual tax return.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is difficult to understand why the drafter of these provisions thought it was satisfactory to rely on the overriding provision of a relevant double tax agreement, when in relation to interest income derived by the permanent establishment in Australia of a non-resident (whether from a treaty country or not), s128B(3)(h)(ii) takes such interest income out of the withholding tax net.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The explanatory memorandum fails to acknowledge that in a vast majority of royalty contracts with non-residents, there is a "gross up" arrangement whereby the non-resident's withholding tax liability is, in effect, met by the Australian resident payer. That the increased tax liability under these measures will largely be met by Australian users of foreign technology, defies logic, at a time when Australia is seeking to become more internationally competitive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the extent that non-treaty country residents are to be denied all deductions in relation to Australian source royalty income, and treaty country residents will be disadvantaged as to the timing of their obtaining the benefit of deductions, there is considerable risk that either the cost of the technology on offer will be outside the reach of Australian licensees or the non-resident provider will potentially not wish to continue to licence Australian users.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also considered unfortunate that at the same time as the Bill extends the s73B deduction for 150% of certain research and development expenditure, there is no proposal to extend the s73A deduction for other research and development expenditure (which is available to non-residents), beyond the 30 June 1995 cut-off date. This is particularly so in the light of the fact that s73B deductions are only available to Australian incorporated companies.</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VJ4">Senator WATSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Although the Government has signalled that it intends to clarify the situation with regard to royalty withholding tax, the industry has indicated to me that this still does not rectify the disparity that exists for similar payments to non-treaty countries which also have an existing permanent establishment in Australia. I know of one company which will have to pay this tax of 30 per cent on gross revenue. This is absolutely outrageous. It already pays tax on exactly the same basis as if it were an Australian company. Note that I said that the tax is 30 per cent of gross revenue. Our normal company tax rate is 30 per cent on revenue less expenses, or net expenses. This company will fold with the imposition of this withholding tax. Further problems with this stage of tax will be pursued at the committee stage, but I think it is atrocious to bring in such a heinous rate of tax that it will actually close companies in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) also extends the availability of tax deductions and depreciation to a wider field of environmental expenditure than is currently available. In particular, a deduction is allowed for this expenditure if incurred after 19 August 1992 and if incurred for the sole or dominant purpose of preventing, combating or rectifying pollution or treating, cleaning up, storing or removing waste. These amendments have generated considerable criticism from sectors of the industry. It is felt that the legislation has implications far beyond those even contemplated or intended by the IR&amp;D Board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Maria Lui, senior tax consultant with KPMG Peat Marwick, Melbourne, and Rodger Fernandez, a solicitor and lecturer in law, in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Butterworths</EMPHASIS>, edition No. 54 state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislature should ensure that special care is taken to draft legislation from a global perspective rather than ad hoc amendments which have the detrimental result for greater uncertainty in tax legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>Presently, under the provisions of this Bill, a new section, 73CB, will be inserted in the Income Tax Assessment Act. This will deny deductions under section 73B if an eligible company incurs expenditure to a government body in connection with research and development activities carried out on behalf of the company if the Commissioner is satisfied that, when an expenditure was incurred, the company was not at risk in respect of the whole or part of the expenditure. It is this new section that has created all the comment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 73CB has been described as not being in conformity with the Budget announcement which stated that deductions would be denied to participants in syndicates involving tax exempt bodies. The proposed legislation appears to have changed direction from tax exempt bodies to government bodies. This will be further pursued when the Bill is referred to the committee stage. Deductible losses on the disposal of traditional securities are also dealt with in this Bill. Section 70B is therefore being amended to prevent the deduction of losses incurred on the disposal or redemption of traditional securities after 30 June 1992, if the securities are essentially of a capital nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment will also apply to losses from the waiver or release of debts. The new rules will prevent a deduction from being allowed under section 70B if the traditional security is one that is regularly traded on a stock exchange or other securities markets and the disposal takes place in the ordinary course of trading on the market. This change has been described as perpetuating a gross tax inequity against taxpayers. As a result of this amendment there will be a lack of symmetry in the treatment of traditional securities in that gains will be assessable under section 26BB, yet losses of a capital nature will be quarantined losses. For example, a superannuation fund investing solely in fixed interest securities will be fully assessable on the gains yet will have a quarantined capital loss which will never be utilised. This is in direct contravention of sections 303 and 304 which are intended to stop this operation. There is a real mismatch in the tax legislation which we are introducing for the first time which is a major concern because of the lack of symmetry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, it is of concern to taxpayers generally that section 70B has been amended to transfer the loss on disposal or redemption of a traditional security to a capital gains tax area. That is, should a section 70B loss be treated as capital gains tax loss, that loss cannot be offset against revenue and profits. Provisional tax arrangements have also been affected by this Bill with the uplift factor for 1992-93 being reduced from 10 per cent to 8 per cent, whilst the margin for error when estimating taxable income when varying provisional tax is to be increased from 10 to 15 per cent, which we welcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Considering the low inflation rate of approximately 1.7 per cent and the low economic growth being experienced, the uplift factor could have been dropped even further. In addition, for the years after 1993-94 the rate is to revert to 10 per cent. Apparently the Government does not believe all its economic advisers, who unanimously appear to be predicting a very slow climb out of this `recession we had to have' under the present economic policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) also covers several other important issues. The write-down valuation arrangements for horse breeding stock have been amended, and I note that the Australian Bloodhorse Breeders Association has submitted that these changes will affect the now lucrative export trade in bloodstock. This trade was expected to reach $50m by 1994. Significantly, the changes will affect the present relationship in this country with New Zealand. Presently the New Zealand bloodhorse breeding industry is in decline and is failing to attract new international buyers because of the positive dollar impact of the original 1985 write-downs which this amendment is now reversing. The overall effect of this proposed amendment will be to give this sort of advantage back to New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also proposes to allow to become tax deductible gifts to certain environmental organisations. While not decrying the need for the tax deductibility of gifts, I do wonder whether this proposal is merely a political sop to the conservation element in our land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also note that this Bill has once again incorporated another one of Fightback's policies, that is, increasing the zone and related rebates by 12.5 per cent of assessments in respect of the 1992-93 year of income and by 25 per cent for assessments in respect of the 1993-94 year of income and subsequent years of income. Generally, the coalition, of course, welcomes these sorts of changes, and we note that the Government virtually has pinched this straight out of Fightback, a policy which it generally is trying to fight against. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn my attention to Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6). This Bill contains measures to implement changes announced in the August 1992 Budget, as well as changes to the prescribed payments system announced by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) in July. The Bill gives effect to the Budget decision to deny a tax deduction for expenses incurred in relation to certain corporate wardrobes or uniforms. Employees will generally only be able to claim tax deductions for expenses incurred in purchasing, cleaning and repairing items that comprise a uniform or corporate wardrobe when the wearing of such clothing is expressly required by the employer as a condition for that employment. Fortunately, the Government has now backed down from its original Budget intention and will now not prevent the cost of non-compulsory uniforms from being deductible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was also announced that the Treasurer will develop strict guidelines to establish whether non-compulsory uniforms or wardrobes, as sets of clothing, are eligible for taxation purposes. Such guidelines are to be published as soon as possible after royal assent to the Bill. I think it is unfortunate that the clothing manufacturers and others involved in this trade are facing this period of instability and uncertainty. These guidelines should be available, should have been ready and should have been on the desk while this Bill was being debated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, I understand that the Government amendments to be moved at the committee stage will provide for the establishment of a register of approved occupational clothing to be kept by the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority&mdash;more expense, more administrative cost and more complexity put on business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition at this point registers its strong disapproval of this sort of legislation on the run. Far too many questions have been left unanswered. If the industry itself is unclear, how does that place us as legislators who are supposedly passing this sort of legislation? There is a clarification that urgently needs to be made, and I call upon the advisers to see that that is expedited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, if the actual wording of the Bill is examined, the Taxation Institute of Australia has noted, there will be real practical difficulties for employers and employees alike in determining at any particular time when there is a relevant policy preventing an employee from substituting items of uniform or corporate wardrobe, `except in special circumstances'. For example, since clothing is defined to include accessories such as ties, belts, scarves, et cetera, must the policies be set out in advance as to what special circumstances should exist for ties to be worn or not worn on a given day? This indicates the degree of stupidity that tax auditors can indulge in to impose penalties on so-called defaulting companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, there will be practical difficulties in establishing whether an employer has, in fact, enforced such a priority. I think it is an absolutely ridiculous imposition on employers. When one considers that, in the corporate wardrobe industry, designs and orders for materials are made up two years in advance, one realises that this method of legislating on the run is just not good enough, particularly in an environment in which this industry is facing such severe tariff reductions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another proposal in the Bill that has attracted volumes of criticism is the amendment to make limited partnerships subject to the same tax provisions as companies. This measure is to apply immediately to limited partnerships formed after 19 August 1992 and to those existing prior to that from 1995-96. The effect of this measure presumably will be the elimination of some alleged taxation advantages which limited partnerships can have over companies, particularly the opportunity to pass off losses directly to investors and the ability of investors, including non-residents, to receive tax-free distributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, many facets of the business world and taxation academia have strongly opposed this piece of legislation. It is moving against international trends, when limited partnerships are the accepted vehicle for major infrastructure development in Australia&mdash;development that we need and employment opportunities that we need. The Government is putting the nail in the coffin. The proposal to treat limited partnerships as companies for taxation purposes is based on the view that taxation advantages offered by limited partnerships have the potential to erode the revenue base. However, in reality, the exact opposite will be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Taxation Institute notes that these limited partnership proposals will be counterproductive to encouraging investment. The Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants notes that this proposal will limit the entities available for the carrying on of a business within Australia; that it will have a substantial effect on investment, especially in relation to new projects that incur losses and bear substantial risks in the early years; and that any loss to the revenue base in the early years will be more than offset by the increase to revenue from the gains made in the later years. Then there is all the revenue that will be gained as a result of the employment consequences and the accelerated impact on other industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any scope for tax avoidance can easily be catered for through the general anti-avoidance provision of part IVA which is available to deny the benefit of blatant, artificial or contrived tax avoidance schemes. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Butterworths Weekly Tax Bulletin</EMPHASIS>, No. 42, in an article by Terence and Deborah Dwyer and Jeff Mann, taxation experts, notes that `the mere fact that losses flow through to partners does not constitute tax avoidance'. That is an important point that is made by those tax experts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a government that promotes the use of a level playing field, this taxation proposal is contrary to that philosophy. Dwyer's article notes that `treasury is tilting the playing field against higher risk investment in new technology "niche" industries', in addition to the bias towards encouraging a monopoly on the sale of new technology to larger companies with the income necessary to absorb start-up costs. Limited partnerships were introduced originally as a convenient and flexible method for investment purposes and have also been regarded as the ideal investment vehicle for projects subject to substantial risks in the early years. Current legislation exists in the States of New South Wales, Western Australia and Queensland for limited partnerships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much concern has been expressed at the high-handed manner in which the Federal bureaucracy is seeking to eliminate limited partnerships. This proposal will frustrate recent State sponsored initiatives for business growth and development. Limited partnerships offer real benefits for States seeking private capital for infrastructure. One can only wonder whether the Government wishes to encourage investment or whether it wishes to continue along the path of the `recession we had to have'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To conclude, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) also contains measures to implement the amendments to the prescribed payments system which are designed to reduce the administrative burden on payers, payees and the ATO. We welcome this move. Dividend streaming arrangements have also been refined so that they will marginally improve the international dividend streaming arrangements. The amendments will result in a resident company being able to preserve a portion of its available franking credits to be offset against the franking debit that arises under the dividend streaming provisions where a non-resident associate pays a related dividend under the streaming arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition welcomes this move but has severe reservations about aspects within both Bills Nos 5 and 6 and the implications they are going to have on the Australian economy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak specifically on the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992. This Bill provides for an increase in the Medicare levy from 1.25 per cent to 1.4 per cent of taxable income from 1 July 1993. In the 1992 Budget it is estimated that this initiative will raise $300m in 1993-94. The Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services and Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Baldwin) in his second reading speech stated that this revenue will fund outlay measures for health and aged care announced in the Budget. Thankfully, long-suffering Australians may never be burdened with this latest taxation impost of the Keating Government. The coalition's health policy, which was released as part of the Fightback package in November 1991, states that under a coalition government the Medicare levy will remain at 1.25 per cent of taxable income and will not be increased. Since the Budget announcement increasing the Medicare levy, the shadow Minister for health, Dr Woods, has stated that a Liberal-National Party government will return the Medicare levy to 1.25 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt about it, Australia's health system is in crisis. Public waiting lists have increased to between 70,000 and 100,000. Private hospitals remain underutilised, with a 55 to 60 per cent occupancy rate. Hospital costs have risen by 163 per cent over the last 10 years. Between 1982-83 and 1991-92 expenditure on medical services and benefits grew at a rate of 19.5 per cent per year. Since Medicare commenced in 1984, the proportion of the population privately insured has dropped from above 60 per cent to about 40 per cent. One of the effects of this has been an increase in the cost of private health insurance, which has risen over the past five years by 130 per cent. These are just some of the symptoms of Australia's current health care crisis. It is a crisis that just will not go away. It is a crisis which will not be solved&mdash;in the short or the long term&mdash;by tinkering at the edges while ignoring the fundamental problems inherent in Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The initiative in this Bill is basically a fraud. Funds obtained from the Medicare levy currently provide only 8 per cent of the total health care costs. Any Australians who are tricked into believing that their Medicare levy covers the costs of health in Australia are being fooled. It covers, currently, 8 per cent of the health care costs. Yet the Government through its publicity continues to inculcate into the minds of members of the Australian public the false perception that the Medicare levy guarantees that all Australians will have access to free and timely health care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increase in the Medicare levy to 1.4 per cent in this Bill shows that this Government does not have the courage to tackle Australia's health care problems. It is unwilling to correct the imbalance between the private and public hospital systems. It lacks the political willpower to introduce a price signal or co-payment in order to reduce overservicing and the overuse of medical services. It does not have the ability to reduce the escalating out of pocket medical expenses faced by health care consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question has to be asked: why does this Government continue to ignore the fundamental problems in our health care system to the point where three State health Ministers and one Territory health Minister have called on the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to scrap the proposed Medicare agreement? In fact, one Minister, a Labor Minister, has resigned over the issue. The answer is simple, and it has nothing to do with the health care needs of Australian citizens. The Government's inaction is based on a belief that the majority of the voting public who do not require regular medical attention still cling to the false perception that Medicare is a free and universal health care system to which they will have ready access. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that the Government's intransigence in the face of the State health Ministers' current revolt is even ideologically based. Maybe some of it is. For purely political reasons, the Government has ducked the much needed reforms of our health care system such as introducing a patient co-payment and encouraging a system of tax credits for taking out private health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to continue to perpetrate this fraudulent perception of free health care, this Government has ignored the advice of its own Minister, the advice of the public servants, the advice of the States, the advice of the medical professions, the advice of the health insurance sector, and the advice of the private hospital sector and the public hospital sector. Who else has to give it advice?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only has this Government ignored the advice from all and sundry but, worse still, this decision to increase the Medicare levy is a culmination of this Government's back-flip on one of the very few decent health care related decisions it has made during the last 10 years. In the 1991 Budget the Government announced the introduction of a $2.50 co-payment for Medicare services, and Senator Tate&mdash;the Minister sitting here&mdash;was the person who had to defend that. He put up all the arguments why it was so wonderful. And we agreed with him&mdash;for once. It was a positive attempt to reduce the health care costs so that there was a price signal to let people know that it cost something to go to the doctor, that there was a cost involved to the taxpayer. It was a good idea. But shortly after the Budget announcement the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact is that to produce the same fiscal result as our GP package (Medicare co-payment) would require a lift in the Medicare levy from 1.25 per cent of income to 1.53 per cent and because this would not stem the growth in service use, further increases in the levy would be required in later years.</PARA>
<PARA>He foreshadowed that it needed to be 1.53 per cent without the co-payment, that the overservicing would not be stemmed and that the levy would be required to be increased. We were told that by the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services. And what happened? The Government back-flipped on it. Mr Howe continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact is that it is neither equitable nor efficient to pump more money into a system which is oversupplied with practitioners and delivering unnecessary services. It would be inequitable to increase the compulsory contribution of working people to finance unnecessary services and services of marginal clinical value brought about by too many doctors.</PARA>
<PARA>What did he say again? He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would be inequitable to increase the compulsory contribution of working people to finance unnecessary services and services of marginal clinical value. . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is what he said this time last year. He said that it would be inequitable for working people, the people that those in the Party on the opposite side say they represent. They have been represented badly for 10 years. Now what is going to happen to the few that are still working? They are going to pay 1.4 per cent in increased tax, which Mr Howe himself said was inequitable. Those on the other side ought to be squirming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time, the Government estimated that the co-payment would result in savings of $1.6 billion over four years. As I said earlier, this current initiative is estimated to result in increased annual revenue of $300m. Given the ongoing recessed state of the economy and the fact that the Government's estimate of revenue from the Medicare levy was not realised last financial year, there must be some doubt and some question cast on whether this revenue estimate will even be realised. As more people join the dole queues, that revenue raised from the Medicare levy will decrease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I guess that the sixty-four dollar question we ought to be asking is whether the Government, if the Australian public foolishly re-elected it, will increase the levy again next year and again the year after and so on. Mr Howe has said that that is the likely outcome of not having a Medicare co-payment. Prior to the chairs being shifted on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Titanic</EMPHASIS> last December, when Mr Howe and his representative in this chamber were fighting and telling us about the importance of the Medicare co-payment, Mr Howe claimed that if there was no co-payment further increases in the levy would be required in later years. I have said that before and I will say it again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three or four surveys have been carried out with taxpayers' money&mdash;the few people left in the work force. The interesting thing is that those surveys have shown that a significant proportion of Australians&mdash;something like 70 per cent or more; I would like 70 per cent to approve of something I was suggesting&mdash;thought we should have a co-payment as a price signal. If the Minister is telling the Government that this is what it should have, if the surveys are telling us that the public accept it, if it is going to bring in revenue, and if it would mean that the Medicare levy does not have to be increased, I would have thought the Government would have kept it. But no, there is no co-payment now. Why? It was done away with as an integral part of the Keating leadership coup. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">About this time last year, around the corridors of Parliament House people were negotiating. They were changing their vote. Members of the Left were shifting over. They were about to shift Mr Hawke right out of the Lodge. One part of shifting him out of the Lodge involved getting rid of the Medicare co-payment because that was going to buy one or two votes. Some people might shake their heads, but that is the truth. That is what happened: he was bought out, sold for a shekel. A few Judases kissed Mr Hawke on the cheek or on the ear, supped with him, and then tossed him out. That is what they did, but they bought that. They did not want that co-payment. That has cost Australia enormously. It has cost every working Australian an increase in the Medicare levy, to start with. No doubt it has cost an increase in the hospital queues as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamental problems in Medicare have not been tackled. There is no price signal in the system to stem overuse and overservicing, for the patient to question the doctor about why he or she should return to the surgery for a result. There is no signal at all. The public hospital system remains undercapitalised. I had a phone call the other day from a person I used to be associated with as a colleague and he said, `Come up to the hospital now and have a look at the people who have been lying on trolleys in casualty for days because we cannot get them into wards. I have just treated somebody on the floor'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The private hospital system is underutilised. With an election looming, Labor is even less inclined to encourage those who can afford it to take greater responsibility for their own health care. Expenditure on medical services continues to rise at a rapid rate. It is little wonder that, when Mr Howe was asked on ABC radio the day after the Budget whether there would be any future increase in the Medicare levy beyond 1.4 per cent, he was reluctant to comment, saying that it would not be useful to do so. It was very difficult for him to comment, I suppose, because he had already said that to cover what would be lost if we did not have a Medicare co-payment the levy would have to go up to 1.53 per cent, I think it was, and that there would be increases in future years. It must have been very difficult for him to go back on what he had said but particularly difficult to say there would not be an increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This decision to raise the Medicare levy to 1.4 per cent and impose a further taxation burden on Australians, regardless of whether they choose to take out private health care insurance, must be seen in its true light. Even with the Government's proposed waiting list reforms and the allocation of more funds to the bonus pool, it is really nothing but a bandaid approach taken in the interests of political expediency rather than improved public health care. Thankfully, an incoming coalition government will mean that the Australian public will not have to wait as long for the needed reforms to our ailing health care system as many of them have had to wait on the long hospital queues. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak briefly to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) and to make four points about that wide-ranging tax measure and the other Bills that are being taken together. Those four small points, which will have a big impact on a lot of industry in rural and remote areas, are the provisional tax uplift factor; the measure to give credit for tax deducted from investment income when varying down provisional tax; increased margins for error allowed when varying down provisional tax; and the zone rebate increase.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has decided to drop the provisional tax uplift from 10 per cent to 8 per cent. I am sure that people will correct me if I am wrong, but I thought that this measure was introduced by the Government to take into consideration one's supposed increase in profits each year as one's business is supposed to expand. I have been saying ever since I came to this place that this is an unfair measure because people do not really know whether their business will increase next year or not. Even in these depressed times&mdash;I am sure that everyone knows that this is the worst depression we have had for the last 60 years&mdash;the Government is still presuming an increase in profit of 8 per cent. Anyone here would know that that is a totally ridiculous situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 8 per cent supposed increase in profit comes at a time when inflation is supposed to be somewhere near zero. It comes during the worst depression for 60 years. It also comes when interest rates on invested savings, which have a lot to do with provisional tax, are almost at an all-time low. Before the Government claims too much credit for interest rates being at an all-time low, let me say that that is mainly because the Government is the only one borrowing money these days, to overcome its shortfall, especially in the One Nation package. Private enterprise, or business, is not borrowing. When the economy does improve, I am sure that interest rates will go back to somewhere near normal again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are always told by Senator McMullan and others that people can vary provisional tax if they do not think they will be making an increased profit of 8 per cent or so. But, of course, they incur a penalty if they are wrong, even though there is something in this Bill to address that matter. I believe that, under section 221YDB of the Income Tax Assessment Act, there are fairly severe penalties if one is more than 10 per cent out. That is what it used to be. Now it is going to be increased to 15 per cent. Of course, to vary provisional tax also costs quite a lot in increased accountancy fees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this measure, the dropping of that uplift factor from 10 per cent to 8 per cent is only for this year. I presume that the Government thinks there is going to be a big upswing in the economy the year after that, in 1993. I can tell honourable senators that the only way there will be increased activity in Australia is if we have a Hewson government by that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move to the next point I wish to address&mdash;that of giving credit for tax deducted from investment income when varying provisional tax. I welcome this move, of course, but I believe that it has not come about for the reason that the Government is supposedly giving&mdash;because of those who do not supply their tax file number and are then taxed at the rate of 49 per cent plus the Medicare levy. I believe that it was in the legislation in the first place to cover the Government's proposal that was later defeated by public pressure regarding a withholding tax on bank interest. I believe it was included for that purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Government has decided to forget the idea of a withholding tax on bank interest, I believe it will only be for a very short time because Senator Button, in answering a question from me yesterday or the day before, did not rule it out in the life of the Parliament. So I believe that is why it was included there, not necessarily because of those who do not supply tax file numbers. All the same, I do welcome the measure. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I made the point when the Government was thinking&mdash;and I believe it still is, of course&mdash;of having a withholding tax on bank interest that it would have been covered by provisional tax anyhow, so there would be no real necessity to have it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point that I would like to address in the limited time available to me is the increase in the margin for error in varying provisional tax from 10 per cent to 15 per cent. Of course, anyone as old as I am would remember&mdash;and even Senator Crichton-Browne might remember&mdash;when that margin was 20 per cent&mdash;not 10 per cent, not 15 per cent, but 20 per cent. That gave a reasonable margin for error. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many Government members think that it is quite easy to vary provisional tax and get it spot on. One can get it fairly spot on, but it all depends on what sort of business one is in. When it comes to rural industries, it is not nearly as predictable as in the case of a big supermarket, a corner store or something like that, where one gets a trend for the year&mdash;it all depends on what the mood of the country is&mdash;and that trend will generally continue from the end of February to the end of June. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rural industries are vastly different. In the wheat industry or the wool industry, the end of the harvest may occur on 28 February and those are the figures that are used to do one's variation of provisional tax. Of course, what is always up in the air regarding payments from the Wheat Board is whether it will drop one in on 28 June or on 5 July. That makes a big difference. A reasonable payment coming in then will blow the 10 per cent variation, the 15 per cent variation and it can easily blow the 20 per cent variation as well. So it can work in some industries and commercial activities, but it certainly does not work in the rural industry. I welcome the 15 per cent variation proposal, but I condemn the Government for not allowing a 20 per cent variation and I also condemn it for putting it in only for one year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point I would like to address relates to the zone rebates that this Government has decided to increase by 25 per cent, starting fairly well down the track. Being from a remote area, I welcome this measure, but I say that the Government is only fiddling at the edges, because those zone rebates should have increased a long time ago by far more than they have now.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, we flagged this in the Fightback package and the Government has copied it, but it has decided not to bring it in until way down the track, and we will have brought in the Fightback measures by then, anyhow. Correct me if I am wrong, but it will be bringing them in only six months before we will introduce them under the Fightback package. Of course, this Government is not going to be in power to implement them at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will show how much the Government is fiddling at the edges with regard to zone rebates. It will have a financial impact on revenue of $5m in 1992-93, increasing to $19m in 1993-94. So if it will only have a financial impact of $19m by that time, it shows that the Government is fiddling at the edges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, under the Fightback measures, we will be doing far more for our rural and remote areas. Mr Hulls from the House of Representatives&mdash;I think he represents the seat of Kennedy&mdash;claimed fame for having these measures put into place, but I believe they were copied out of the Fightback package. He was telling us how good they were for Kennedy&mdash;and probably it would be the same for the seat of Kalgoorlie, which I live in&mdash;but they are certainly nowhere near enough. We will be far better off with the Fightback package, under which we are taking off 26c a litre on fuel and taking off sales tax and all those other measures.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wanted to take this opportunity in this cognate debate to refer very quickly to the matter of the taxing of limited partnerships as companies, which my colleague Senator Watson has referred to in his brief contribution to the debate. It is a great shame that the Government, helped by the Democrats, has ensured that these complicated matters which affect the lives of so many Australians can be debated for only such a short time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The limited partnerships taxation decision announced in the Budget is not a matter which is very sexy when it comes to politics, but it is something that will hurt this nation at a time when its infrastructure has run down&mdash;and this is on the admission of both the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button). The expenditure decisions in the One Nation statement were to a great extent designed to pump some money into our rapidly running down infrastructure. That was public money, borrowed money, money which would force up interest rates. Most people in Australia know&mdash;or do not know, but should know&mdash;that Australia still suffers some of the highest real interest rates in the world. This makes the cost of money which should go into infrastructure or any other development project higher than it should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was proposed to use the limited partnership structure in the very fast train project. It has been used in a number of major infrastructure and development projects&mdash;for example, Mr Acting Deputy President, tourism developments in our own State of Western Australia. It is a structure that is tax effective in that people can make an investment through a limited partnership structure and can use the losses suffered in the early years of these major projects to offset against income from other sources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's proposal is clearly designed to ensure that it reaps income in the current year; it has clearly signalled that it does not want to wait around for the income from limited partnership structures, particularly in infrastructure projects. As we know, by their very nature infrastructure projects involve a massive investment of funds up front and low and limited returns many years down the track. That applies whether one is building a major road, a tunnel, a bridge or a railway, and it also occurs when one is building a major tourism development where masses of funds need to be invested up front. Australia is now in a position where it needs infrastructure development. It needs tourism development; it needs major development, and this one measure&mdash;</PARA>

I know that he is privately disturbed about the decision to tax limited partnerships as companies. He was personally responsible for encouraging the Victorian Government to introduce legislation to ensure that it had a limited partnership structure in place so that it could be used to fund major infrastructure projects and to allow private investment infrastructure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision announced in the Budget by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) to tax limited partnerships as though they were companies will ensure that many projects that we will not even be aware of will not get to the drawing board stage.

In the short time I have available, I want to say that the Government stands condemned for this very short term decision which will cost Australia jobs, cost Australia investment and cost Australia a place in a competitive world environment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to bring to the attention of the Senate yet another appalling decision by the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services, Mr Baldwin. He has recently announced that he will not permit Australian research fellowships and senior research fellowships to be tenable at Commonwealth research organisations and at the Institute of Advanced Studies at the ANU.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This decision is completely unjustified and is contrary to the objectives of the fellowship scheme, which were to encourage the return of world class expatriate researchers, to support high quality research and to develop research skills fundamental to the national interest with the aim of boosting Australia's research and technology push. This move by the Minister focuses on the potential contribution of the fellowship holder to the host institution rather than to the contribution of the productivity of Australia's research effort overall.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister's decision is contrary to the real national interest. As stated by the shadow Minister for education, Dr Kemp, if there is a public interest in facilitating career paths and research then this public interest also requires that those career paths be able to be developed in the most appropriate institution, whatever that may prove to be. If an institution has successfully established itself with a reputation for world class research, this is not a reason to provide incentives for outstanding researchers to go elsewhere in order to give other institutions similar reputations at the expense of established institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister's decision was made in a very sneaky way, with no press release, a selective leak to the media and a letter to the heads of institutions concerned. If such a dramatic change in policy towards Australian research fellowships had to be announced in such a low key way, the Minister is obviously ashamed of what he is doing and it is clearly the wrong decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Research Council has for a long time declared that there is a clear policy to support research excellence and research concentration. It is damaging to both training and the research requirements of fellows to deny them the opportunity to work in certain institutions. In the current arrangement fellowships are awarded to individuals, not to institutions, and that is the way it should stay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister's decision is damaging not only to research but to the ambitions of a clever country. It represents a waste of resources by bureaucratic edict. Most of all, it is bad for the fellows and for the fellowship scheme because it limits the prospects and opportunities, and on average it reduces the incentive for the best researchers to return to Australia. The needs of research are paramount, not the needs of the host institution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister's decision is harmful to the people who are most concerned, the fellows who are so rigorously selected as the best researchers available. It is extremely harmful to the conduct of Australian research. The awards should be made on the basis of excellence and the `awardee' should be able to go to the best places for research. To debar the ANU and the CSIRO from these awards contradicts the primary aims of the awards as stated, and that is to reward excellence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the high profile of the ANU and the CSIRO internationally, the new policy will strongly compromise Australia's ability to attract back high quality people from overseas. The concept of a clever country is universally agreed upon and applauded. But how can the clever country become a reality unless excellence is the overriding criterion? For the sake of the clever country and the continuing success of Australia's research, the Minister must reverse this poorly thought out decision. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to discuss the current funding crisis afflicting universities across this country. In particular, I wish to draw attention to the chronic funding shortage in New South Wales higher education institutions, specifically the University of Technology and the University of Sydney. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> has highlighted this problem recently in its series `Campus crisis', which detailed the extent of the cutbacks and the effects on course size and quality and staffing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not give me any pleasure to relate the problems facing these institutions&mdash;each symbolising the oldest and the newest aspects of higher education in this country. Sydney University is the oldest tertiary institution in Australia. For many years it has enjoyed a wonderful reputation based on the outstanding quality of its teaching and research, for its beautiful campus, its classical architecture and broad extracurricular activities. Today Sydney University is suffering due to funding shortfalls and the increased pressures brought about by the Dawkins led reforms of 1987 and the amalgamation process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sydney University is now host to five satellite campuses: the Cumberland College of Health Sciences, the Faculty of Nursing campus, the College of the Arts campus, the Conservatorium of Music campus and the Faculty of Education campus. Like many other institutions, Sydney University faced insurmountable government pressure to amalgamate&mdash;pressure that at times was tantamount to blackmail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">University administrations, student organisations, staff and students all over the country have had to adapt to the stress of an increased student load and, with it, a need for greater services, transport hassles and greater education requirements. To cope with these new responsibilities, little government funding or assistance was forthcoming. Instead, in the interests of `rationalisation' and `streamlining', students and staff dealt as best they could with the mega-institutions that had been created. Today our oldest university is contemplating massive cutbacks to staff and courses and, consequently, education quality. The University of Sydney is not alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The University of Technology, Sydney, formerly the Sydney Institute of Technology, merged with campuses from the college sector to create a new university. Almost overnight, it was expected, this institution would transform from a technology driven place of learning to adopt a more classical mode of teaching and research. Similarly, the colleges with which it merged were products of a different education sector again, one that had a more liberal educational influence. These vastly different education institutions, each serving different education purposes and responding to different community and personal needs, were thrown into the Dawkins hotpot, which almost halved the number of tertiary institutions in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This dramatic transformation of the higher education system took place at a rate and to an extent that was unprecedented. In some cases, the short term consequences of the merger process proved too much for some institutions, such as the University of New England and the Maritime College in Tasmania. Many institutions are only beginning to witness the long term consequences of amalgamations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This leads me to the articles in last week's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> entitled `Campus crisis'. They exposed the severe funding shortfall in New South Wales higher education institutions. The articles revealed the level of expected funding cuts to UTS and Sydney University and proclaimed that this represents a national funding crisis for education. It is obvious that subsistence funding levels at these institutions will severely diminish the quality of courses, and the hardest hit are the humanities faculties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have received petitions from Sydney University students and I strongly support their protests against the economic rationalist approach of the university administration and the diminution of the level and quality of their courses that will occur as a result of funding cuts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Staffing cutbacks, by as many as 40 people in 1994 in Sydney University's Arts Faculty, will result in reduced access to teaching staff for students, less supervision in specialist areas of study and undue pressure on all-important staff-student relationships. Plans to privatise security and cleaning services, and cuts to staff entitlements such as sick leave at Sydney University, greatly concern me, as do reports that the Science and Engineering faculties at UTS use computer simulation for experiments, that field trips have been reduced and that teacher training has been halved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">UTS has a greater number of part time students&mdash;49 per cent&mdash;than any other university, and thus suffers under the Government's relative funding model, where two part time students are funded to the equivalent of one full time student. The university will enjoy only a 2.5 per cent increase in funding next year, most of which will be spent on salary increases. In the meantime, teacher numbers are declining, class sizes are increasing and scientific equipment necessary to science and media courses is obsolete. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similar reports have come from the University of New South Wales. Professor John Milfull, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences at the University of New South Wales, has reported on findings that show this faculty was underfunded by 10 to 15 per cent last year. Chronic underfunding of our universities threatens the atmosphere and the environment of institutions that are the lifeblood of our intellectual progression as a society. Funding levels per full time student in higher education have been slashed by almost 10 per cent in the five years between 1984-85 and 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government has failed to match increased places with funding for infrastructure, staffing and capital works. Students have had to tolerate substandard facilities, with overcrowded tutorials and lectures, inadequate laboratory equipment, insufficient course materials and library books, which contravene occupation health and safety regulations and have a detrimental effect on teaching standards. Students are rightly suggesting that the education they pay for must be of an excellent standard if this country is to emerge from recession and if we are to become the clever country. This crisis signals an erosion of the historical role of a university in providing a centre for learning, research and progress and suggests that the Government's priority areas are those mostly commercially viable areas and do not stress other areas such as the humanities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have outlined examples of tertiary institutions that are feeling the pinch in my home State of New South Wales. Unfortunately, there are many more examples I could discuss as well. I stress the importance of this matter and urge the Government, with its economic rationalist view of education, to reconsider the role of education in society. Education is not a revenue raising measure that produces graduates in the same way as products come off a conveyor belt; it is a guiding light that leads to a more democratic and inspired society.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I wish to bring to the attention of the Senate a matter of grave concern for members of the Australian Defence Force concerning restrictions that the Government, through the Public Service Commissioner, has placed on ADF members who take redundancy and then wish to gain employment in the Australian Public Service. The restriction means that redundant Australian Defence Force members are excluded from joining the Public Service for a period of time equal to the length of their severance benefit. The maximum exclusion period equals the maximum redundancy payment of 48 weeks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This policy was conveyed to the Department of Defence by the Public Service Commissioner, Mr Denis Ives, in a letter dated 11 September 1992. But the final date for Army personnel to nominate themselves for redundancy was 8 July 1992. There is no doubt that the 510 members who nominated themselves and were subsequently accepted for redundancy did not know on 8 July that there was a restriction on their ability to join the Australian Public Service. The only restriction members were aware of on 8 July was that contained in the ministerial determination No. 211 of 1989 made under section 58B of the Defence Act. Paragraph 11 of that determination is quite clear. If an Australian Defence Force member who is made redundant subsequently rejoins the Australian Defence Force within 12 months of leaving, without ministerial approval, in a full time uniformed position, he must repay the redundancy payment in full. There is absolutely no mention of any restriction on, or penalty for, joining the Australian Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts are that 49 Army personnel left the Australian Defence Force on the redundancy program before learning of the receipt of Mr Ives's letter and the policy contained therein. Yet during debate on the report of Estimates Committee B on 10 November, in response to a question from Senator Newman, the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If 50 in the Army did leave under a misapprehension&mdash;I would like Senator Newman to get all 50 to say that they did&mdash;we will assist them; we will approach the Public Service Commission and say, `These people have been disadvantaged. We do not believe the rules should apply to them. They should be helped'. Sure we are willing to help them.</PARA>
<PARA>The help to which the Minister refers is this: the 49 members who left the ADF without knowledge of the Public Service Commissioner's policy will be allowed to take up a position with the Public Service only if they repay their redundancy payment on a pro rata basis up to the maximum of 48 weeks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 461 who left, or will leave, after 30 September are now prevented from joining the Public Service for a period equal to that of their redundancy payment, up to the maximum of 48 weeks. The letter from the Public Service Commissioner, dated 11 September, states that this policy is in line with the restrictions placed on employees of the Australian Public Service and non-Australian Public Service Commonwealth agencies. In fact, Mr Ives said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I confirmed these arrangements apply to former APS staff and to staff retrenched by non-APS Commonwealth agencies. For this purpose the ADF is regarded as a non-APS Commonwealth agency.</PARA>
<PARA>This is in direct opposition to previous practice, which has recognised that Australian Defence Force members, despite being paid by the Commonwealth, do not enjoy Public Service conditions and pay. In fact, under section 87 of the Public Service Act 1922, ADF members are not classified as people employed by a Commonwealth authority, and no ADF member can take benefits under the Australian Public Service Redeployment and Retirement Award 1987. This means that redundant ADF members cannot be redeployed within the ADF, nor within the Australian Public Service or any other Commonwealth agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, and I feel that this is the most important point, Australian Defence Force members do not enjoy any special rights over the general public in applying for Public Service jobs. The effect of the Public Service Commissioner's policy is only to stop ADF members applying for Australian Public Service jobs advertised externally which they must win on merit over all comers. This is a right which any member of the public has, including those who have taken a redundancy package from the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue is not new. Senator Newman raised it in this chamber on 10 November and Mr Rocher, the shadow Minister for defence science and personnel, raised it in the House of Representatives on 7 October. Both my colleagues have raised doubts about the legal basis of this policy. Indeed, I think this is the crux of the issue: the correctness and legality of the policy decision. Given that the advice given to the ADF about these new restrictions does not appear to be based on ministerial determination No. 211, I am interested to know on what basis and authority this decision has been made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In reply to another question from Senator Newman during the debate on the report of Estimates Committee B on 10 November, the Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Ray, stated, and I quote from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard:</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am saying that in terms of our having a policy on this matter, they being voluntary redundancies, it is open to us, I believe, to determine the conditions of those redundancies. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet during the debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1992-93 in the House of Representatives on 7 October, the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Mr Bilney, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I need to point out very clearly that the Public Service Commissioner is an independent statutory position. There is no way in which a government can possibly interfere with his statutory role so I need to make it clear that, when he does come to a final decision on this matter, we are obliged, as Ministers in this Government, to accept the verdict that he hands down.</PARA>
<PARA>So I would like to ask: who exactly made that decision? Was it the Government and its Ministers, was it the independent Public Service Commissioner, or was it generated from within the Department of Defence; and, whoever made this policy decision, was it correct and legal?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have made some inquiries as to the answers to these two questions and I am not really happy about the information that I have received. So I would ask the Minister for Defence whether I am correct in believing that: under section 33 of the Public Service Act 1922, the Public Service Commissioner does not have the power to extend the restriction which currently applies to Australian public servants to members of the Australian Defence Force; only a Minister can impose such a restriction by amending ministerial determination No. 211 of 1989, and any such restriction cannot be retrospective; alternatively, a Minister can impose such a restriction by introducing and passing a Bill to amend the Public Service Act 1922; and a Minister of this Government has made no such amendment to ministerial determination No. 211, nor has a Bill to amend the Public Service Act been introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that, if I am correct, it is entirely possible and even highly likely that members of the Australian Defence Force would be entitled to take legal action. Given the potential seriousness of this situation, I would also make the following inquiries of the Minister. Firstly, has the Minister or his Department sought, or are they seeking, legal advice on this matter, and what is that legal advice? Secondly, is the Minister aware of any other Government Minister or department, the Public Service Commission or any other interested body seeking such legal advice, and what is that legal advice? Thirdly, is the Minister aware of any member of the Australian Defence Force who is affected by this policy decision considering taking legal action through the courts? Fourthly, what correspondence have Government Ministers received from the headquarters of the Australian Defence Force, and does it contain advice, legal or otherwise, about the validity of the policy stated by the Public Service Commissioner?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the Minister also whether, if I am correct in thinking that only a Minister can impose such a restriction by amending ministerial determination No. 211 or the Public Service Act 1922, and that this has not been done, the Minister will take the following actions as a matter of urgency: firstly, to instruct the Public Service Commissioner to withdraw his advice to the Department of Defence; secondly, to notify members of the Australian Defence Force who are about to leave that they are once again able to apply for Australian Public Service positions advertised externally on merit without restriction; thirdly, to ensure that any Australian Defence Force member who has already left and joined the Australian Public Service will not have to pay back to the Commonwealth part or all of the redundancy payment as previously advised; and, fourthly, to undertake to discover how many members left the ADF and won Australian Public Service positions on merit but were subsequently denied those positions, and re-offer them the position, offer them a similar position or, if that is not possible, compensate them adequately for being unjustly denied a position they were entitled to all along. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I am sure the Minister is fully aware that the 510 Army personnel caught up in this confusion were compelled to make a decision between two superannuation schemes&mdash;DFRDB and MSBS&mdash;by 30 September this year, a decision which the Minister knows cannot be changed. There can be no doubt that the major influence on their choice between the schemes was their impending redundancy. The importance of this choice should not be underestimated. There are vast differences between the two schemes. MSBS is almost identical to the Public Sector Superannuation scheme, providing benefits no matter when the Australian Defence Force member decides to leave, but DFRDB provides a lifelong pension only after the member has served 20 years. Under DFRDB, members who serve less than 20 years get back their own contributions only, not even interest on their contributions, and therefore lose considerable money. Surely it must be obvious that Army personnel on this redundancy program who had not yet served 20 years had no choice but MSBS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe this goes a long way to explain why only three of the 461 members who were given the opportunity to withdraw from the redundancy program did so. I would suggest that, if they had been given the opportunity to reconsider their choice between DFRDB and MSBS, the number of withdrawals would be significantly higher. I look forward to a response from the Minister as to the legality of the policy stated by the Public Service Commissioner and to answers to the related matters I have raised today on behalf of hundreds of concerned Defence Force members. </PARA>

Secondly, I would like to make the point that, when debates on matters of public interest were first established through the committee dealing with Standing Orders, it was not envisaged that they would be used as an opportunity to have Ministers come in and reply. The fact that I do so today should not create an expectation that constantly on Thursdays various Ministers will come in to reply.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When senators such as Senator Ferguson show great courtesy by notifying Ministers that they want to raise something, there is an expectation that Ministers will come down on the adjournments when they are notified in advance, and if they do not it will be at their own peril because whatever is said is not answered. You will know that occasionally Ministers have a reason why they cannot come down on adjournments, but generally they try. I make that point because Senator Ferguson in his address did indicate he would like me to answer some questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not being a shorthand note taker I did not take down all the questions, but the matter was raised by Senator Newman during Estimates committee hearings and I indicated to her at that stage the position we were at. I say across the chamber to Senator Newman, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that I regret that the day after Senator Newman raised the matter one piece of advice arrived which would have been very useful to her the previous day, and I am critical of those who did not get it to me at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The background to this is that in April this year the Army approached me with a proposal for a limited redundancy to assist it with `downsizing', that wonderful word that has got into the modern lexicon, to meet four structure objectives, in order to meet what I think we all recognise as greatly reduced separation rates over the last year and a half. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After consideration of a range of issues relating to the proposal, I approved a redundancy program of 350 in June of this year. The number of personnel who volunteered to take up the redundancy ended up being far in excess of the 350 I had authorised. Therefore, in August I approved an additional 160 redundancies, taking the total to 510, for 480 of which the equivalent positions would be abolished behind those leaving. I did leave scope for 30 promotions in the system because that again slows down in a time of poor attrition rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was during discussions with the Department regarding these additional redundancies that the issue of what conditions would apply in terms of re-employment, in the public sector or elsewhere, first arose. At that time I indicated that normal Public Service conditions would apply. The Department then sought clarification from the Public Service Commissioner regarding the status of ADF members. The Public Service Commissioner wrote to the Department on 11 September 1992 making it clear that the ADF is regarded as a non-APS Commonwealth agency. As such, ADF members who accepted redundancy should not be employed in the APS, either immediately after or within a reasonable period of their separation from employment with the ADF. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We did receive inquiries from ADF members which prompted the three Service chiefs on 24 September 1992 to get advice on the Public Service Commission's policy. Neither the Government nor the Department wishes to see individual members disadvantaged by accepting a redundancy package without full knowledge of all the conditions that apply. This is a critical factor, I believe. If anyone has accepted a package without the full knowledge of what that package entails, then that disadvantage must be remedied, again stressing that this is a voluntary package and that, once all the conditions are known and people make the voluntary decision, that is their decision to make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had discussions with the Public Service Commissioner which produced an agreement that those Army members who had already accepted redundancy benefits and who separated before 30 September 1992 may apply for Public Service positions and be considered for employment without the required break in service. There was the condition that I think Senator Ferguson mentioned, that they must pay back to the Commonwealth the notional unexpired portion of their severance benefit, and all that comes back to why people pay redundancy benefits and the advantages that accrue therein. I might say that a 20-year veteran usually gets an equivalent of one year's pay, the tax benefit of which doubles its value. I think no-one in the Senate would challenge that particular point. All other members who accept the redundancy offer will be ineligible for Public Service employment during the term of the redundancy payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, those members who have accepted redundancy but have not yet separated, who feel that this policy seriously affects their original acceptance, may elect to withdraw from the program. In other words, if they were offered a redundancy and they now believe, because they cannot get a job in the Public Service, that they do not want to proceed with the redundancy, they may return to the service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Ferguson raised the question of what is the overall legality of this particular situation. It is a question that I have also thought of. Recently, we sought and received advice from a QC, and that is under Government consideration. I am happy to release that QC's opinion when Government has considered the matter. I do not believe that it is general practice to do that before Government has considered the matter. But I must say that Mr Finnane, QC, in a very impressive opinion, has raised some of the questions that Senator Ferguson has raised here today, so that will impel me to give those considerations within Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department has just written to the Public Service Commissioner and requested that the policy be withdrawn until the matter is resolved by Cabinet. I do not believe we have had a response yet on that issue. The Government has separately asked the Public Service Commissioner to report on the options to deal with employment of people who have accepted voluntary retrenchment from government employment. In other words, the Government as a whole&mdash;I am not sure where it was initiated&mdash;has written to the Public Service Commissioner on this matter. We in Defence, raising specific defence issues, have written to the Commissioner and passed on Mr Finnane's legal opinion. I hope that this matter can shortly come to Cabinet and be resolved because there are issues of conflicting principle involved. I do not want to see any serviceman disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I have to say that redundancy, on the other hand, is a specific tool with which to assist people who are projected to be unemployed for some time. That is why it is treated so generously from a tax point of view. I stress again that this was voluntary. I stress again that those who took a voluntary redundancy, knowing all the conditions, made that personal decision themselves. If there were any&mdash;and I think I mentioned a figure to Senator Newman of up to 30&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My contribution to the discussion of matters of public interest today relates to the proposed World Heritage listing of the Nullarbor, a matter on which I have been campaigning for some year and a half now. Honourable senators will probably be aware that this World Heritage listing of the Nullarbor was proposed by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories, Mrs Kelly, 18 months or so ago with the support of the State Ministers for environment in South Australia and Western Australia. The Minister at that time in Western Australia was Mr Bob Pearce, who has since decided to resign as Minister for the environment for reasons that are well known in Western Australia, and the new Minister is Mr Jim McGinty, the member for Fremantle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wanted today to share with the Senate another piece of world heritage in the embodiment of a Mr Thomas Dimer who, like yourself, Mr Acting Deputy President, had the great honour to have been born out in the wild outback of Western Australia. He is 89 years old and I had the pleasure of meeting him last Friday. Thomas Dimer has spent most of his 89 years living on the Nullarbor and working out in the bush. He probably knows&mdash;and perhaps someone like Harry Butler could either support or contradict me in this&mdash;more about the flora and fauna of the Nullarbor region than any living person on this earth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thomas contacted me after I had made a number of public statements in relation to the proposed World Heritage listing of the Nullarbor, which I oppose, and asked to meet with me and share some of his knowledge. One of the great benefits of the meeting I had with him last Friday morning was that Thomas was able to show to me a book which he has written&mdash;or had transcribed for him. I think it is a series of interviews with some people from the Battye Library. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a fantastic tale of his life, which I was able to skim over in a short time. It started 89 years ago. There are stories about the pioneering days out on the Nullarbor and in the outback regions of Western Australia. It is a book which Thomas seeks to publish. I gave an undertaking to him last Friday that I would seek to find someone to help fund the publication of this story. It is a unique part of Australia's history and something which has led me to call Tom Dimer a person who should actually be listed as World Heritage, far more so than the Nullarbor region itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tom Dimer is an interesting character. He knows and loves the Nullarbor probably more than just about any living person on this earth, and yet he is vehemently opposed to the World Heritage listing. He sets out his reasons in a letter he wrote to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper, which in its great wisdom it decided not to publish. I call on it to publish the letter because, firstly, Tom Dimer is a great old character who has a story to tell, and, secondly, he adds some important facts to the debate about whether the Nullarbor region would be protected or enhanced by having a boundary drawn around it which would be posted off to World Heritage headquarters. I think the headquarters is in Geneva or Paris or some other city of great relevance to the Nullarbor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the indulgence of the Senate, I shall read parts of his letter. Mr Dimer sets out some of the problems that have faced the Nullarbor over the last 100 years, mostly relating to feral and vermin animals. He states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed World Heritage Listing for the Nullarbor Region is intended to protect native plants and animals. However, it may be counter-productive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The station owners and farmers there have taken an interest in the well-being of their surrounding properties for a number of years. Feral or vermin animals (especially cats, foxes and dogs) have been controlled whenever possible. The local people have been trying to redress the damage done by early introductions. By curtailing the efforts of these people the Environment Minister would create an uncontrolled breeding ground where native species stand little chance of survival as the vermin would be out of control as they can increase very fast left to their own survival.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have spent many of my 89 years on the Nullarbor. My experience has spanned many decades as I have worked for the Agricultural Protection Board, local Councils and the Police Department on many occasions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To list this area as World Heritage or an A Class Reserve is only creating a haven for the vermin. The vermin (especially the introduced kind)&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I guess he might be referring to politicians when he says that&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is eradicating all the native species such as an example:-</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 5 different kinds of lizards, goannas, snakes and such like. The hopping creatures such as the ring tailed possums, tree kangaroos (which there are at least 4 other kinds of species). They wiped out the curlews, plovers and all birds that nest close to the ground. The cats especially, which were introduced early in the century, are endangering a lot of creatures because of their ability to  survive on the small native creatures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All these species were in plentiful numbers especially on the Nullarbor Plains. I have noticed this more so from the early twenties as I was around that area for quite some years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the 80 odd years of my experience with the bush&mdash;I studied the wildlife and flora and quite often would open up the different kinds of vermin and discover particles of native animals inside them that hadn't been digested. I would at any time be prepared to debate with the environmental ministers over this issue as I feel that he is doing great damage to native wildlife.</PARA>
<PARA>The point that Tom makes in a long letter&mdash;probably too long for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>&mdash;reinforces my own experiences on the Nullarbor, having crossed the Nullarbor on road and rail about 17 or 18 times in the last 15 years. His point is that the station owners, the motel operators and the highway operators all have a very strong vested interest in controlling vermin and in protecting their environment. To a man, woman and child on the Nullarbor&mdash;almost all of whom have signed the petitions that I have been tabling in the Senate virtually every day for the last year&mdash;they are opposed to World Heritage listing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are scared of World Heritage listing, particularly the pastoralists, who fear that, even with the best intentions of the current Ministers for the environment and the best assurances given them by the Western Australian Labor Government, the South Australian Labor Government and the Federal Labor Government, the security of their tenure on their leases would not be affected by World Heritage listing, the listing is a threat to their tenure and therefore a direct threat to their investment in things such as fencing, which is used to control vermin, and water conservation, which is designed and implemented to preserve the natural vegetation. This investment costs millions and millions of dollars every year and this investment, which specifically helps the environment on the Nullarbor, is put at threat&mdash;not only by World Heritage listing but also by the very threat of World Heritage listing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators may or may not know that the World Heritage listing was intended to proceed this year and that the State Government in Western Australia, probably for political reasons, allowed that date for nomination to pass without the nomination going forward. The governments responsible, the Federal Government and the two State governments I have referred to, spent just over $100,000 this year having three studies done into the heritage values of the Nullarbor. None of those studies involved any consultation whatsoever with the local people&mdash;a matter which I have raised many times. People like Tom Dimer who really do know about the Nullarbor were not spoken to. The pastoralists and graziers who spend every day of their lives working on the Nullarbor, who understand the flora and the fauna better than any bureaucrat in Canberra or particularly any politician in Canberra or Perth, were not consulted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have called on the Ministers, firstly, to release those studies which the taxpayer has paid for and, secondly, to end the uncertainty that the people on the Nullarbor live under, and that is this threat of World Heritage listing. Until we have a definitive statement either from the Federal Minister or the State Minister, Mr McGinty, that World Heritage listing will not be proceeded with, their lives will be under doubt and the investment that they would seek to put into the Nullarbor in terms of fencing and water conservation will be reduced. Of course, the long term impact of that is that the very objective of World Heritage listing, which is to preserve and protect the native species of flora and fauna on the Nullarbor, will be jeopardised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I take the opportunity of this debate to call on those Ministers, firstly, to release those reports, and, secondly, to make a joint statement before Christmas&mdash;because it would be a very good Christmas present for those hard working, long suffering people who earn their livings from the Nullarbor Plain&mdash;that World Heritage listing will not be proceeded with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They have the reports before them. They have had all the studies done. They have not done any consulting. They do not need to; I have done that for them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A powerful group of people, Senator Ray. We met with 55 people out at Cocklebiddy earlier this year. They are all opposed to it. The locals do not want it; the local councils do not want it; the thousands of people who have signed my petitions do not want it; and I would venture to suggest that if the native animals could talk out on the Nullarbor, they would not want it either because they are well looked after and preserved by the people who have a vested interest in preserving the environment from which they make their living.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because I can see that people are falling asleep around me, I will conclude by recording my thanks to Tom Dimer for coming forward&mdash;indeed, coming into my life, to put it emotionally. He is a part of living history. I encourage anyone who wants to understand more about the history of the outback to come forward and help Tom Dimer publish his fascinating story of life in the outback. Tom Dimer is a classic old Australian and there are not many of them left. Even when saying that he needs to find $2,000 or $3,000 to publish his story, he said, `I don't really want anyone to give me the money; I just want them to lend it to me. I'll pay it back because the book will sell'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He is only a pensioner but he wants to pay it back. He was not looking for a handout. He is an old digger who has worked very hard all of his life, out in some very tough country. I hope that people will come forward and find a way to make sure that Tom Dimer's story is shared with future generations of Australians, and that his wish be fulfilled that his country, the Nullarbor Plain&mdash;which is so close to his heart&mdash;not be World Heritage listed and not be controlled by politicians and bureaucrats who have no affinity whatsoever with that part of the world. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make one brief observation to the extent that the Advance to the President is partly a global amount of the appropriations for the Department of the Senate. I noted in the discussion in the Committee of the Whole on the appropriations for the Department of the Senate that there is some difficulty in the Department of the Senate managing on its appropriations, to the point where juggling&mdash;of a not particularly sophisticated kind&mdash;has to take place with the various aspects of the funding so as to allow the place to continue to function.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Getting printing done outside of the building comes under administration. We can continue to have our printing done but we cannot have it done in-house because it comes under the category of wages, and when the wages budget is running 20 per cent ahead of schedule we have to manipulate the books. I do not mind enlightened accounting practices, but it goes past that point. We clearly have problems in relation to the funding of committees, and to the general functioning of the Parliament. If I thought there was a concerted effort by the Government, in terms of its own distinct functioning, to cut back&mdash;I am not talking about Government departments; I am talking about the process of government to cut back equally&mdash;I would not mind. However, when we choke off funding to the Senate, we are choking off the only avenue available for scrutiny of government and legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we see the legislation being introduced into the Parliament growing in both number and sophistication, as is inevitable in the more sophisticated society in which we all now live, the committee system of the Senate will have to continue to grow, to be upgraded and to become more sophisticated and more diligent and more capable in the discharge of its responsibilities and duties. That can only take place provided there is adequate funding. It has been an ongoing battle for the last three or four years when I have been involved to get levels of funding for the Senate which allow it just to carry on in a very ordinary way. We now have the new process of efficiency credits and so on, so that virtually we are getting less each year. </PARA>

That process was chaired by Mr Dawkins and basically supported by Mr Willis; neither of them has strong or, probably, any views about the Senate at all. This building has added to the expense of the running of everything. The increased legislation program must create pressure. The tendency, if one is an Australian Democrat, is to try to solve difficult political situations by setting up a committee. That adds to the pressures. The pressures on the time of senators mean that more and more staff are needed to write the reports, and that is a bad trend.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the problem. I think the committee system can work very well, provided senators run it. I do not see much point in setting up committees if staff run them and consultants come in and write the report. We need a rationalisation of the committee system in this chamber. Even on the other side of the chamber, where there are more potential candidates than on this&mdash;we have Ministers who cannot serve, neither can Presiding Officers&mdash;the pressure is being felt to find people to go on committees. I do not know what the answer is long term. We looked at combining standing committees with Estimates committees to get overall expertise, and whether we should set a limit on the number of select committees we set up, but that creates enormous problems of timing. When the first two or three get their select committees in, no-one else can have a go. We looked also at whether we should head for more joint committees with the House of Representatives. That brings party-political considerations far more into the deliberations than under the Senate committees.</PARA></TALK.START>

But I have not detected recently the sort of aggro that the honourable senator may suggest, as an intention to fix the Senate up by cutting its funding. It would be true to say that three or four years ago a certain Finance Minister had those views. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not delay the consideration of this motion a moment longer except to say that I am sure Senator Ray understands that a democracy is not the most perfect system of government in the world but, of course, it is one of the most fragile and one which brings with it all sorts of inherent costs. To ensure that it is preserved there is an inordinate price to be paid, in the same way as people look at the costs of running this building and try to make some value judgments as to whether they are getting value for their money. Provided democracy is working and is seen to be working and is not some indulgence and extravagance, it is primarily, fundamentally, and certainly notionally, a good investment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Ray made the observation about the number of departments of the Parliament. I remember a proposal once by the Government to create one super department. Of course, when the costings were done for that it was demonstrably obvious to anybody who had read the consultant's work that while it might have centralised everything in Leo McLeay's office, it certainly was not doing anything for efficiency, competence or cost cutting. If anybody on this side could be satisfied that the amalgamations of departments would not in any way dilute the quality of the performance and would create efficiencies, nobody would be disagreeing with them, but simply amalgamating because big seems to be beautiful and best is presumably not the best way to go, particularly when one is trying to run a department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for the system of committees, as I say, I think there are dilemmas. One is that the more committees there are, the more strain there is on those able to serve. The obvious point is made in respect of the Government that it has fewer people to go around, but as long as we are dealing with the sort of legislation that we are dealing with and its complexities, it is inevitable that if we are to have proper consideration and deliberation and even contemplation of legislation, the committee system is needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know how my colleagues get on, but I have never had one person on my staff who has ever helped me on a committee, either to write a minority report or to contribute to a majority report or even to do research for me.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very simply, this is yet another add-on, a tacked on amendment to an omnibus Bill which was dealt with a little while ago. The Industry, Technology and Commerce Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 came into the Parliament in its original form without any mention of an amendment to the Australian Institute of Marine Science Act. It also came in without any mention of proposed amendment to the Trade Marks Act. The Trade Marks Act amendments were added on to the Bill after debate had commenced. These amendments were added on when the amendments that the Senate effected to the part of the Bill dealing with the National Measurement Act had been carried. So again we are seeing an example of poor Government management.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this amendment does, however, in this case is quite useful. It is a pity that attention cannot sometimes be drawn to the first-class work that the Institute of Marine Science does. In moving these amendments, the Government is giving formal legislative recognition to the role of commercial programs within the charter of the Institute. In effect, these are similar to the amendments that were moved previously to the ANSTO Act that aimed at legitimising that organisation's commercial operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Institute of Marine Science comes before Estimates committees it always gives straightforward, informative answers and it always keeps the Parliament apprised of what commercial work it is involved in. Indeed, it is quite a shame that a lot of its work, particularly at the forefront of investigation of historical temperature analysis, is not given more prominence than is given some of the more trendy research which has less factual foundation than the work that the Institute does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I join with Mr McGauran, in the other place, to pay tribute to the work of the retiring Director of the Institute, Dr Joe Baker, as his seven-year term comes to an end this month, and place on the record the fact that at all times Dr Baker has shown a great willingness to share the information and the research that his Institute has done with the Parliament. I repeat that that work has been first-class. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a shame that I cannot say good words about the National Standards Commission, which operates under the National Measurements Act. I refer to the amendments which we passed in this chamber and which have been accepted in the other place. Subsequent to the amendments in this place, which were very significant because they deleted from the Act a power that was to be given, sought by the Commission&mdash;draconian powers of search and seizure which the Australian Democrats joined with us in denying the Commission&mdash;far from accepting the will of the Parliament and the debate that caused that decision to be made, Mr Birch and his Commission flouted the intention of the Parliament by sending around a survey that was blatantly contemptuous of the decision that the Parliament had made. It was put in rather innocuous terms, and asked whether people believed the Commission should have the power to ensure patent compliance and whether they would support an amendment to the Act to give the Commission similar powers to those of weights and measures inspectors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was the very issue that the Parliament had debated in great depth and here he was, in absolute contempt of that debate, trying to get those draconian powers restored to him. I suggest that Mr Birch take a look at the debate in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. He will see that there was grave concern about the powers that he was seeking, and that the reasons that he and his Commission were denied them were based on sound argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the way in which the Government is using omnibus Bills to bring together disparate matters that bear no relationship to one another, and tacking bits on after the Bill has been introduced as a method of dealing with something that somebody may have forgotten earlier, is poor legislative form. When we dealt with the trademark legislation we looked at the prospect of putting a person in gaol for turning out a T-shirt with somebody else's logo on the front of it. I think that is pretty serious stuff and it is something which I, as I expressed at the time, was opposed to. I think the manner in which that serious matter was introduced into the Parliament was an insult and an indictment of poor management. I stress that I do not in any way or shape disagree with the substance of the legislation that has been introduced&mdash;dealing with the Institute of Marine Science&mdash;but I do disagree with the way in which it was done. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to add the support of the Australian Democrats for these amendments to the Australian Institute of Marine Science Act. I agree with Senator Bishop's concern about the way that these amendments have been tacked on to what was a very long and complex omnibus Bill. I was not made aware that these amendments would be made to the Industry, Technology and Commerce Legislation Amendment Bill until 5 November. That was some time after we had dealt with the primary Act in this Senate. I had a letter from Minister Free which informed me that these amendments would be made and that there was some urgency in these amendments being accepted, as the commercial potential of a number of current AIMS proposals were dependent on the timeliness of their release into the market. If these amendments were so urgent, why were they not made in the principal Bill, when we considered the issue some weeks earlier?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wrote back to the Minister and offered our support for these amendments, contingent upon assurances being given to us that the capacity for AIMS to commercialise its research would not result in real funding cuts to its budget. I am pleased to say that the Minister has given me those assurances. We will certainly be looking at the budget line item for the Australian Institute of Marine Science in the future, to ensure that the Minister's assurances to us about its budget will be maintained. I offer our support for these amendments. However, it is with the rider that the Committee is concerned that we are now dealing with these amendments some time after the previous Act has been passed by the Senate, and that the Minister has given us an assurance that the capacity for commercialisation will not result in budget cuts to the Australian Institute of Marine Science. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Health. A couple of weeks ago, I had a phone call from a local newsagent who was very concerned about one of his elderly customers of many years. He told me that she needs a hip replacement and, according to him, she has been on a public hospital waiting list for two years. He rang in desperation to find out whether there was any way he could help to get her further up the waiting list. He said he could not bear to see her struggling into his shop week after week in more and more pain and becoming frailer and frailer. How can the Prime Minister claim that Medicare provides an equitable, efficient and fair system of health care for all Australians when between 70,000 and 100,000 people are forced to wait, as has this lady, for months and even years, often in considerable pain, for access to a public hospital bed?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no doubt that Senator Patterson's compassion for this particular constituent is very real, and I know it will be shared by all honourable senators. The question is what practical steps can be taken within our health care system in Australia to ensure that those who are suffering from some illness or the effect of some traumatic accident are given the best medical and hospital care. The answer by the Government is to strengthen the public hospital system in a way which enables waiting lists to be reduced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Patterson knows, a considerable amount of money has been promised to the States for a program over the next two years to reduce waiting lists but, more specifically of course, to ensure that those who want to avail themselves of the public hospital system will find a strengthened system because, over the next six years, we intend to put $1.6 billion into that system under the Medicare agreement that is presently being negotiated. That agreement looks to total health care, not just a financing proposition such as comes out of the Fightback package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What comes out of the Fightback package is a proposition that, in addition to paying tax and the Medicare levy, persons should be compulsorily required to take out private health insurance, without any regard to their income capacity, except for very low income pensioners, for example, where money will be taken to subsidise them but taken away from the public hospital system. Nothing the Opposition is suggesting will produce more bed days availability within the public hospital system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that what we are putting forward from this side of the Government in the renegotiations is a recognition that, for example, there is a place for private health insurance. That is recognised in the preamble to the Medicare principles which are being incorporated in the Bill and being put forward by Mr Howe in the Medicare negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Principally, there needs to be a recognition that Australians continue to support Medicare and its general philosophy of ensuring that all eligible Australians are entitled to receive proper health care through our public hospital system. I believe that that strengthened system gives a better hope to Australians for the relief of the sort of suffering of which the honourable senator spoke, rather than requiring them compulsorily, household after household, to take out private health insurance premiums.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. The Minister said that this year the Government will give money to reduce waiting lists, and I think the figure this year will be $50m. From 1987 to 1989, the Government gave $50m, matched dollar for dollar by the States. That did nothing to reduce the waiting queues in hospitals. What will the Government do? The Australian public wants to know when the Government will have a plan that brings the Australian health system back into some array, makes it fair and equitable and reduces those waiting lists, especially for that lady about whom I am talking, and all the others who are waiting in queues.</PARA></TALK.START>

Exports of Pacific oysters to the United States should not be affected. Exports of flat oysters have recently been made to Holland to test the market.

I believe that in all of these ways there is a considerable indication by the Government that it values the place of private health insurance within the overall health care system of Australia, but not to the point of obsession, which seems to be the case with the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Our basic attitude is one of very real concern that the current political unrest in Pakistan will lead to a chronic polarisation of political life in that country with the potential for over-reaction or excessive use of force either by the Government or by the Opposition in Pakistan. Honourable senators will be well aware of reports of the Pakistani security authorities intervening on 18 November to prevent a march led by former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto from entering Islamabad. The aim of that march was to urge the Government to call new elections.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services. Given that the coalition health finance policy is to give a tax break to low income earners to help them with the cost of private health insurance, should they choose to take it out, and to impose a tax penalty on the high income earners who continue to ride on the taxpayer by choosing not to take it out, why did the Minister mislead this chamber and the Australian public by asserting earlier today that under a coalition government private health insurance will be compulsory? Did he do so because the Government has no plan to fix the ramshackle mess that our health administration in Australia suffers from?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought that the sort of language I used would have been well understood by a party which is driven only by financial and commercial considerations, because it is quite clear, for example, in relation to the high income earners that the honourable senator spoke of, that they will be under coercion and compulsion because honourable senators opposite would levy a financial penalty on them if they did not take out private health insurance. That is the sort of coercion and compulsion that they would be subjected to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that we do have a policy. I have outlined it several times in this chamber. It is a policy which has to do with strengthening the access of those eligible Australians to our public hospital system primarily, but also, of course, to help with those private patients who attend our public hospitals&mdash;by a massive subsidy; I mentioned some $800m with respect to that. There are many elements of the Government's health care policy which make it much more than the health financing policy with which the Opposition is obsessed. In relation to primary health care given by GPs, whether in an urban or a rural setting, in relation to a reduction of waiting lists and in relation to a whole host of matters&mdash;particularly aged care, for example&mdash;we believe there is a need for a comprehensive health policy which provides for fair health and hospital access for all Australians who qualify on a strictly clinical basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that regard we believe that the Medicare enterprise was launched so successfully by this Labor Government and is endorsed by seven out of 10 Australians, and will continue to have the support of most Australians&mdash;principally, of course, that part of it that has to do with bulkbilling. Except for pensioners and card holders, the Opposition would strip that away as a possibility to be offered by GPs when they are visited by ordinary low income Australians.</PARA>

The Minister knows that the proper answer to the question of whether or not it will be compulsory is no. He knows that there is a tax incentive to help low income earners in, and a tax penalty to push high income earners in.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Spindler's motion, in the final form in which it has emerged for consideration by the Senate, is certainly an improvement on the one circulated earlier today. The Government commends it as an improvement, particularly as it seems to recognise that the true role of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities is a supervisory one. It is quite right that it should act as inquisitor of the Australian Securities Commission in relation to the effectiveness of the undertaking by it of its duties under the Australian corporations and securities legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It still seems to me to be perhaps going beyond the proper role of the parliamentary Joint Committee. That role is defined in section 243 of the Australian Securities Commission Act which relevantly speaks of the parliamentary Committee's duties being to inquire into and report to both Houses on activities of the Commission which the Parliament's attention should be directed to. That is a paraphrase of its role, but basically it is to report on the activities of the Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In so far as this motion attempts to have the Joint Committee examine the identity of the buyers and sellers of shares during relevant times, inquire into the question as to whether any of the shares traded in that period were traded and are now held by third parties and whether any benefits were derived on the basis of access to information about the casino tendering process, it may well be that there is a trespassing on the division which the Parliament saw fit to make between the role of the Australian Securities Commission and the Joint Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that we are really on the edge of confusion of the role of both of them, somewhat akin to what we have already been through in relation to the National Crime Authority. I believe it has to be clearly understood that the role of the joint parliamentary committee is to carry out investigations into allegations of insider trading and that the parliamentary committee cannot substitute itself for the Australian Securities Commission in that regard.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister representing the Treasurer (Senator Button) this day, in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Watson on 24 November 1992, relating to Australian Tax Office administration of Sales Tax exemptions.</PARA>
<PARA>The answer relates to certain disarray in the Tax Office as a result of the unreal commencing date of 1 January for the so-called streamlined sales tax legislation. As the Senate is aware, the Tax Office has had difficulty in getting the required booklets out to the various eligible taxpayers. Consequently, the Tax Office is anticipating that a very significant number of taxpayers will not have their registration by the due date, 1 January 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration inquiry into the simplified sales tax Bills was told that it would be impossible for the Tax Office to effect the necessary administrative arrangements by that date. Despite these warnings, the Government went ahead with an unrealistic commencement date and will cause many problems for taxpayers who will not have received their registration number under the new streamlining arrangements by 1 January. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Tax Commissioner has issued a press statement which indicates that taxpayers will not be inconvenienced. But I am told that this somewhat contradicts what is outlined on page 1 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Streamline sales tax: how it affects you</EMPHASIS> and on page 4 of an accompanying booklet for primary producers. The implication is that those who do not register will have to quote an exemption declaration&mdash;which is the one that has been referred to in Senator Button's answer&mdash;when buying certain goods used in their business. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This procedure is much more consuming than using a sales tax number as you must give details to your supplier regarding the circumstances in which the goods will be used and in which exemption item applies. If you are registered, you do not have to supply these details,&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>obviously&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">you just have to quote your sales tax number.</PARA>
<PARA>But the problem is: how will ordinary, everyday taxpayers know the number? Furthermore, these taxpayers who have not received their registration number cannot get the declaration certificate from the merchants; they have to apply to get the forms from the Australian Taxation Office. In the case of primary producers, this will be in the middle of harvest time and it will cause a great deal of problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another problem. People will need to give details on the exemption certificate of their exemption declaration; their name, address, and telephone number; what goods they are buying; how they will use those goods; why they are making a claim; and under what exemption item they are claiming the exemption. They will be asked to sign the form and give it to their supplier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will cause further problems to individual taxpayers because not only will they have to get this declaration from the merchant, according to the Tax Office, but also they will have to apply for it. These forms are only available in the regional and the city offices. Furthermore, people cannot apply for just one form, because if buying fencing fittings and other items they have to lodge a separate form for each eligible item. So it is quite wrong to indicate that taxpayers will not be inconvenienced if they do not have their certificate registration number by 1 January. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also remind the Minister to tell the Tax Office that there is some confusion about the messages given on the hot lines because they are confusing exemption certificates and exemption declarations.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be five Opposition speakers on this matter of public importance. I will be talking briefly about the Medicare agreements; Senator Patterson will talk about the private and public hospital system; Senator Walters will talk about the Government's attempts to destroy the private hospital system and private health insurance funds; Senator Newman will elaborate on the plight of women and the problems of access for the aged; and Senator Herron, who is a very well-respected surgeon and knows the area extremely well, will talk about the poor quality of health care delivery that has developed under this Government over the past 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are debating this matter of public importance as a result of the blind refusal of this Labor Government, further demonstrated today at Question Time by Senator Tate, the Minister representing in this chamber the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe), to recognise the role of the private sector in health care&mdash;a refusal that will cause the collapse of the private hospital system in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today the Australian Private Hospitals Association took a very unusual step of launching a national campaign throughout Australia to demonstrate its vital role in Australia's health system. That campaign will conduct an audit of its patients, the staff and the operations performed today. That will be an invaluable audit because it will demonstrate the problems that this country would have if the association undertook the course that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is advocating when he says, `Many people are privately insured and they don't have to be'. If that is the case and that is the cause that this Prime Minister, Mr Howe and Senator Tate want to take on to ensure that people move away from private health insurance, they must be aware of the consequences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More than 100,000 people cannot gain access to hospitals for operations today. Senator Walters asked a question today about the $3.5m that this Government is spending on its self-promotion, as opposed to spending its own Labor Party money during a campaign to promote its policies, which are yet to be announced. Senator Walters simply asked: how many operations would that $3.5m cover if put towards hip operations? Senator Tate refused to answer the question. Yet it took Senator Panizza to tell the Senate that it would save the pain and suffering of 350 patients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This country has a right to a better health service than that which it has today. This same Labor Government is raising the Medicare levy from 1.25 per cent to 1.4 per cent. This is the Labor Government that has said, `We will not increase the Medicare levy'. This is the same Labor Government that has said that there will be no capital gains tax. This is the same Labor Government that has said that there would be no child living in poverty by 1990. However, it was smart enough not to talk about the parents living in poverty by 1990. The fact remains that this Government cannot do a thing about the financing of health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ten years ago this Government said that the Medicare levy would be self-financing for health. Let me tell honourable senators where we are at with that. In 1989-90, the levy covered only 21.3 per cent of health costs. It was nowhere near 100 per cent. By 1990-91, it covered 19.2 per cent. Last year it was down to 17.2 per cent. The projection for 1992-93 shows that it will be down to 17 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the Government that tries to pretend that someone's levy&mdash;the levy that it is now in the throes of increasing&mdash;is miraculously going to pay for the total cost of health. The levy is now covering 17 per cent of it. How does the Government fund the rest of it? It does so by increasing general taxes&mdash;by increasing the tax take right across-the-board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the rise in the levy will not make any difference at all in 1993-94, after which the same trend obviously will continue if the people of Australia are unlucky enough to have this Government continue in office. But there will not be a problem because there will be a change of government. So the 1993-94 prospect will not become a reality. This Labor Government is in the process of dragooning the States into a new Medicare agreement that supposedly assists public hospitals. All that the States must do is undertake to somehow increase their proportion of public patients in public hospitals. It is just extraordinary! How on earth can they start increasing the number of patients when the beds are not available?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A couple of weeks ago in the Senate I gave example after example of people who are experiencing serious complications as a result of being locked out of the public hospital system. Yet their access to the private hospital system is going to be further restricted when this Government implements a policy to remove more and more people from the private health insurance system. It is typical of this Government's blind and stubborn approach that it refuses to contemplate the fact that some public patients may be perfectly able to afford private cover and it is taking beds away from those public patients who cannot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many patients in public hospitals are locking out low income people. We plan to free up that system. The proposals in the publication, the so-called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Charters for public patients</EMPHASIS>, are an exercise in futility when the root cause of the problem of waiting lists is simply and deliberately ignored. </PARA>

<PARA>They are the words of a Labor State Minister who has seen fit to resign over this Labor Government's mismanagement of the area of health.

They have grown and grown. So there is no point in trying to tell us that the situation is being resolved. It is being exacerbated by the Government's policies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, not just for public hospitals. We do not have any ideological blinkers. We say that private health insurance has a role. The Opposition is saying that the further financing of the health system, which is required, really depends solely on ensuring that a good premium income is coming in to the private health insurance funds. We do not believe that that is the case. We do not believe that tax credits and penalties is the way to go to ensure that that money flows through to those who practise within the health system through the private health insurance mechanism, because that is what principally would happen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's policy emphasises that there is a need to strengthen Australia's public hospital system. Our primary concern is for all those Australians who need some medical attention or hospitalisation and depend on our public hospitals in order to receive that service at a time when they have suffered some acute malady, the consequence of a chronic illness or the effects of a traumatic accident on the road or in an industrial situation, whatever it might be. We believe they are entitled to that service and that our great public hospitals definitely need to be strengthened. That is why we are proposing to spend another $1.6 billion in supporting those public hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that that is the best way in which to use taxpayer support for the provision of health care for Australians. We do not believe that it should be used by diverting taxpayers' moneys away from that particular type of funding of public hospitals to providing a tax credit for low income persons whom the Opposition wishes to encourage to take out private insurance. That is not the way to spend those hundreds of millions of dollars. The money should go directly into the public hospital system, with some private health insurance. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. About 11 per cent of the whole health care costs of Australians comes out of funding through private health insurance. The great bulk comes through taxpayer supported initiatives of Commonwealth and State governments. That is where Australians derive the greatest benefit in relation to the provision of their health care. The tax system and the Medicare levy, based as it is on a progressive tax system, means that those who can afford to make a contribution to the health care of Australians will make it in proportion to their income rather than by private health insurance premiums, which do not differentiate between the income of those who are paying it for a particular provision against the prospect of payments because of a visit to a doctor or the need to be hospitalised or to receive some other treatment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We clearly have a priority in favour of strengthening the public hospital system. I believe that that has to be completely reiterated and understood. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the whole question of the provision of health care, it has to be emphasised that one is not simply speaking of a funding mechanism. One is speaking of what one wishes to achieve. We are all concerned with the cases which we are all aware of, of those who have the treatment of an illness or a condition which is causing them pain delayed or deferred because of a difficulty in getting a bed at a time which would give them relief earlier than otherwise. That is why this Government has provided some $70m over the next two years specifically to deal with the waiting list problem. But that is only a portion of the way to remedy the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bigger effort in that regard will come from the extra moneys flowing into the public hospital system under the general agreement to put in an extra $1.6 billion over six years. But, by specifically tackling the question of the queuing of people for treatment and in ensuring that those who are in the queue get treated according to an assessment that is based on clear clinical need, we will emphasise and help in that assessment so that we have a true listing in priority of those who require and deserve the treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In these ways we are addressing the question of the health care of Australians and not simply concentrating obsessively on the private health insurance mechanism to pump money into, it is said, the provision of health care, but it may be simply into the pockets of those who provide health care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important that we recall that within the Budget provisions of the Federal Government in the whole question of the provision of health care for Australians a very real effort is made to strengthen the provision of health care by those who most people see most of the time, that is, their GPs. In Tasmania this is well appreciated and coincides with the establishment of a chair in community medicine and rural health matters at the University of Tasmania out of Launceston. As a matter of social equity and social justice there is a real requirement that those who live outside the major urban areas of Australia have access to good health care from their GPs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are certainly strengthening that network of rural doctors and those in the smaller towns of Australia who can be persuaded to stay in, or move to, those areas to provide that sort of care. That is the sort of practical step that we are taking to provide better health care for all Australians. It is one that I am quite sure is held in very high regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many ways in which the Government is concerned to take steps to help in this regard. If one is talking about access to primary health care and general practitioners, one has to keep in mind that bulkbilling is an important part of the experience of many Australians as they approach their doctor for advice as to a problem that is bedevilling them and causing some ill effect, either physical or mental. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They go to their GP and the GP, under the Government's Medicare scheme, can make a choice as to whether to bulkbill that person, whether to make a bulkbilling arrangement. We believe that that is proper and part of the freedom of choice which is characteristic of Australian society and ought to be encouraged. We find to our horror that, under the Fightback alternative which is being paraded today, in relation to those who are not pensioners or cardholders&mdash;I refer to the remaining 80 per cent of the Australian population&mdash;GPs will not be allowed to bulkbill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is extremely important for Australians to understand that if they wish to retain a system of health care which has provided the greatest certainty and equity that the Australian community has seen in relation to the provision of health care over the last decade, they must support the strengthening of Medicare. The alternative being proposed by the Opposition will do away with the provision of health care in a way which I believe probably will be unmatched in the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, there are those cases which we are all concerned about and which have been put to the Senate during Question Time. But we know what the alternatives are around the world. We know the desperate plight of those who are so dependent on a private health insurance system, as occurs in the United States. One is terribly fearful of either oneself or a member of one's family falling ill because of the need to pay very high health insurance premiums. Or they find that when they go to the hospital, the hospital asks whether they have a health insurance card, and if they do not have a health insurance card they do not get treated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Herron himself has said in debate here, the United States has the best health system in the world&mdash;for those who can afford it. It is not the same here. One can get very good health care in Australia without the need to be wealthy. That is a result of the Medicare program which has been instituted by this Government. I know that for a fact through personal experience of the health care system here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a place for private health insurance within the Australian health care system. It is only a proportionate place. The major place lives within the role of the Australian, State and Territory governments to help, through the taxation system, to strengthen the public hospital system. That is our primary obligation and duty to the Australian people. We continue to press for that in the negotiations that are taking place. Over the next few weeks those negotiations will come to a conclusion which will verify the fears that are held by all States as to what would happen to their public hospital system under the Fightback proposals. Quite clearly, with a reduction of 5 per cent in the funds paid to the States under the Fightback proposals, there would be much less money available to the States for them to spend on various public services, which must include their hospital services.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It follows absolutely certainly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition would strip away $31m to $32m from Tasmania through the reduction in the general grants made available. That would have to flow through to the provision of services for the Tasmanian people, including the provision of hospital services through our public hospitals, such as the Royal Hobart Hospital and others. That is a prospect which, when understood right around Australia, will fill not only the general citizenry but State and Territory Health Ministers with foreboding. I am quite sure that before the election day they will sign this agreement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Looking at the matter we have before us, the emphasis today on hospitals, and in particular private hospitals, is understandable because it is the day the Private Hospitals Association is launching its campaign. It is a campaign with which the Democrats have some sympathy. We understand some of the problems that are being faced in our health care system today. But it is not just today that we see this emphasis on hospitals, hospital funding and waiting lists. The impression one gets from listening to debates in this chamber is that health is all about hospitals and the ongoing philosophical debate about whether hospitals are publicly or privately funded, about whether we need waiting lists, how many waiting lists, how many people are on them, should we have them at all, should we try to clear them, and so on and so forth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before looking more deeply at the issue, I do not want to gloss over the problems that certainly are evident in some hospitals with some long waiting lists. But there are far more problems in hospitals than waiting lists. The Government should start acknowledging that it has responsibility for those who are moved out of hospitals early, whether because of day surgery or whether because it is simply now the practice to move people home fairly rapidly. The Government must accept its responsibility for their ongoing care and monitoring, and not somehow try to push that into hospital funding as it now stands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will argue that in Australia we do, indeed, have a good health care system once one is sick. But what I want to argue today is that our health care system should be more than an illness abatement program or a sickness management program. In particular, I want to look at the document entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Enough to make you sick: How income and environment affect health</EMPHASIS>. It is put out by the national health strategy team. It is research paper No. 1, September 1992. I quote from the executive summary:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are overwhelming inequities in the health of Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again and again, similar themes emerge when the inequalities for the most disadvantaged groups are examined:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They have the poorest health</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They make the most use of primary and secondary health services, but they are the lowest users of preventative health services</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Their poorer health status largely explains their greater use of primary and secondary health services.</PARA>
<PARA>So who are these Australians? I do not think anyone in this chamber has any doubt that they would include the unemployed and under-employed, hundreds of thousands of children, many people in rural communities, particularly farming families, single parents, the homeless and the tens of thousands of Australians who now rely on welfare agencies for basic food, clothing and other essentials. I go on to look at what this research tells us. I quote again:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall standardised death rates are highest for those from areas experiencing the worst socioeconomic disadvantage. Compared with people from advantaged areas, these people have standardised death rates which range from 46 per cent higher (for girls) to 67 per cent higher (for men). They also have higher death rates from certain causes of death&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I will deal with that later. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of all people in the community, those of low socio-economic status are:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">most likely to suffer disability</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">most likely to suffer recent illnesses</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">most likely to report being only in fair or poor health as opposed to good/excellent health. (for example, low income men are 167 per cent more likely than high income men to view their health in this way, and similarly, low income women are 148 per cent more likely to do so).</PARA>
<PARA>It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to having poorer health status according to these illness indicators, people of low socioeconomic status are more susceptible to certain chronic conditions . . .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the disorders which affect those of low socioeconomic status disproportionately are associated with certain behavioural risks which are more prevalent in those of low socioeconomic status.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. smoking . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. being overweight . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. being inactive . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Having read that, I can only ask: when are we really seriously going to start to look at prevention, instead of spending all our time in this chamber and so much of our resources on cure?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The States are doing this in bits and pieces. I note that in my State of South Australia, unfortunately, we now have an extensive program of food provision for children&mdash;not just primary school children but also secondary school children. And it is not just breakfast; sometimes it is lunch and in some schools it also extends to after-school additional supplements. If for no other reason, surely we should be concerned about the fact that they cannot concentrate and often do not behave themselves if they are hungry. Indeed, with regard to South Australia, I do not know of the need ever having been greater than it is now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that, on a national level, we need to look at a truly national food nutrition program&mdash;and I am not talking about just food supplements. We need a federally funded and coordinated program that involves making sure kids understand what is good food and the importance of a good healthy diet versus continuing the intake of what we may best describe as junk food. By senior primary, and certainly into secondary school, we should have classes&mdash;and I am sure many of us can remember them&mdash;that actually show students how to prepare nutritious meals, looking to the future when these individuals will actually be caring for themselves. This information could then be taken back and shared with the family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People may believe that this is happening in schools. Unfortunately, as we see the pressure for subjects in other areas, this is not now happening universally; far from it. Our school systems are going backwards. Cuts to education in almost every State have meant a reduction in the number of teachers, additional pressure on teachers and a change in priorities&mdash;away from learning for life and life skills to education for employment and virtually nothing else. We have seen in many schools the virtual demolition of what used to be known as home economics, certainly for anybody after year 8, and then it is done only in a very passing and cursory manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at a document entitled `Common and agreed national goals for schooling in Australia'&mdash;and these goals are supposed to provide a framework for cooperation between schools, States and Territories and the Commonwealth&mdash;we see that goal No. 9 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To provide for the physical development and personal health and fitness of students and for the creative use of leisure time.</PARA>
<PARA>That is so full of holes, so inadequate and so vague that one could probably have an annual walkathon to fulfil that basic goal in terms of fitness for students. As for personal health, handing out a few pamphlets would probably be enough. As for the creative use of leisure time, other subjects such as music and art are falling by the wayside as well as physical education and home economics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Physical education programs are constantly under pressure in our schools and the pressure is getting greater. The pressure is to reduce time, so kids are finding that, if there is any physical education available, it may be for only one lesson a week; there certainly is not daily physical education in most schools. Students are being counselled out of activities; told that it is far more important in year 8 to do academic subjects. Indeed, one of my daughters was in this situation. By year 9 no physical education is available for many students. In many schools now, as teacher cuts go on and on, the teacher is not trained in physical education, and so often what the students are learning and doing is not appropriate and tends to turn off as many students as it benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as that, for those schools that are still running physical education programs, finances are becoming so tight that many kids have to sit on the sidelines. This is not just the old problem that always existed with students moving into senior years and attending recreational activities such as ten-pin bowling; it is now happening for gymnastics and dances in the junior schools. Schools are no longer either upgrading their gym equipment or even maintaining it so it can be used. Instead, they are bussing kids to the local gym and employing an outside teacher and $1, $2 or $3 has to be handed over. Kids from low socioeconomic backgrounds simply cannot afford it, and they sit and watch. Surely a healthy life is as important, if not more important, than a purely wealthy one. We really need to look at what our schools are doing and what our kids are being told. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Returning to these national goals, the use of leisure time is an essential issue not just for those who are employed&mdash;or those who want to drop off at the gym on the way to work, jog in their lunch hour or perhaps go to squash on the way home. It is essential for all Australians, and that includes those who are unemployed and underemployed and those who have not had these opportunities at school. People need to understand the importance of maintaining a reasonable level of fitness and people need to be confident when they want to undertake activities. For example, people need to be confident enough to actually take the kids to the beach, knowing that they can supervise because they themselves can swim; or be confident enough to go for a fun run or perhaps bush walking. If these people have not had this experience either in their days at school or with their families, there is very little opportunity for their children unless they get these experiences at school. Many families simply do not do a lot of what we would consider to be the ordinary, everyday recreational activities because they have less opportunity and because they lack finances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to finances, the demise of our physical education programs in most schools is not such a problem for parents who have high or moderately high incomes. They can perhaps even send their kids off to a private school and, as most private schools are able to maintain programs, the problem is solved. But, where their children attend public schools, they can afford to send their kids to swimming coaching or tennis coaching after hours; they can take their kids ten-pin bowling or skating on the weekend. It is the kids from backgrounds where there is not sufficient finance and where parents have not had the experience who are suffering the most. Hence I look back at this document and see it as simply reinforcing what the national health strategy has found. Very briefly, I would argue that our physical education programs really are a national disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not see any sign, despite all the research that has been done&mdash;and this is only one document that has shown it&mdash;that we are about to divert one dollar to schools to ensure that we have a healthier and fitter population. Indeed, it may be health dollars that are really needed in our schools to ensure that some of these basic programs are up and running. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Returning to the matter of death rates, this document, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Enough to make you sick</EMPHASIS>, says:</PARA>

<PARA>What does all this bring us back to? Let us go back and look at the issue we are discussing today&mdash;`The health of thousands of Australians being put at risk by the Prime Minister advocating "that Australians do not need private health insurance"'. I would say it is being put at risk by our ignorance of what really is the underlying problem, our total ignoring of the preventive side of what we should be looking at in terms of our health policy. I would argue very strongly that just talking about hospitals and where the money is coming from is not the real issue. Harping on how we are going to fund health is important, and I think we need to sort some of that out. No doubt speakers after me today will look further into the hospital system. But what we really need to look at is whether or not in this country we should start really trying to prevent illness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have looked at only two ways of doing that and they both fall within the education system.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Lees wants to talk about public health and illness prevention, I would suggest that it would have been much better if that lady had been in hospital very soon after she had been diagnosed as needing a hip replacement so that she did not lose her mobility and then develop other illnesses as a result. Getting that lady into hospital and getting her a hip replacement is an aspect of preventive medicine. Had she been able to afford private health insurance&mdash;or had it been after the next election when she gets a rebate for having taken out private health insurance&mdash;she might have been able to get a hip replacement without having to wait two years. Senator Lees should not come into this chamber&mdash;now she is leaving&mdash;and tell me, `We have a very good health system once you are sick'. It might be very good if one has an acute illness, but if one has a chronic illness it is awful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has said that Australians do not need private health insurance. That is a big fib. He can go and tell the lady who struggles into my local newsagent every week that she does not need private health insurance. She would have had that hip replacement by now had she had private health insurance. I ask the Minister whether he takes out private health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A week ago my mother and stepfather came back to Australia after living in the United States for 25 years. They are shocked by the cost of private health insurance here; they had top private health insurance in the United States. What did I do in the first week they were back? I made sure they had private health insurance cover. That is how sick I think our system is. The Prime Minister says that they do not need it. I said, `Don't believe Mr Keating, Mum, because you know he is wrong'. She rushed off with me down to the local pharmacist and enrolled in private health insurance. I know that if she needs a hip replacement she will get it. She is not really in a position to pay the health insurance premiums she is paying, but she said, `I will give up other things because I need that cover; I want that insurance'. Mr Keating is wrong. People do need private health insurance. After 10 years, the time the Government has had to get it right or to do something, the health system is in the depths of the blackest crisis ever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier today, when I was speaking on the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill, I said that a doctor, with whom I was associated in my previous profession, rang me recently and said, `Come to the casualty section of my hospital right now. There are people lying on trolleys who have been here for days and I have just treated someone on the floor'. I thought I was talking to someone in a Third World country. No, it was a young fellow who, after some years in general practice, has gone back to train as a surgeon. He was working in casualty and he could not believe what had happened to our hospitals since the time he had left when he was a resident doctor in training after completing his medical education at university. He is not a Liberal voter. He has joked with me about being a Labor supporter. He is not a Labor supporter any more. He cannot believe what Labor has done to our hospital system. The hard reality for Australia is that Labor's so-called free and universal health system has led to a grossly inefficient, expensive, not so universal and definitely unstable health delivery system; and it cannot be sustained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every day we see the gross failings of the Government's health care system. Every day we are reminded of our health care crisis. We now have a health care system where public hospitals are underfunded and overcrowded, and the number of Australians waiting for elective surgery has increased to between 70,000 and 100,000 in just 10 years. This means that thousands of Australians are currently waiting, many of them in considerable pain, for routine operations such as hip replacements, prostate operations, cataract operations and other things, which would enable them to have a better quality of life, especially those in their latter years. We are talking about them having a quality of life in their last 10 years. Some of them will have been so disabled by the waiting period that they will not ever again have a quality of life. This Labor Government has subjected those people to spending the rest of their lives with a disability which resulted from the failure to get into hospital when they really needed treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have a health care system where private hospitals are underutilised with a 55 to 60 per cent occupancy rate. That means that just over half of the beds in private hospitals are being used. It is not surprising, because we have a million unemployed people who cannot afford to take out private health insurance and a lot of people who would if they could take out private health insurance. They cannot afford it, and there is no incentive for them to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been estimated that 20 to 25 per cent of those earning $40,000 or more a year fail to take out private health insurance. What happens when they get sick, especially if they get an acute illness? They take up a bed in a public hospital that should have gone to someone who really could not afford to have private health insurance and who really should be in that public health system. That is what those people do. Those people who can afford private health insurance and who can afford to take a greater responsibility for their health care deprive pensioners and low income earners from gaining access to the very limited number of public hospital beds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have a health care system where the cost of private health insurance has risen by 135 per cent in the last five years. I do not need to tell pensioners about this. Many of them still keep their private health insurance at the expense of other things, sometimes even food. They turn their heaters off and do all sorts of things to try to save enough money to get basic hospital cover. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Twenty per cent of the Australian public have jettisoned their private health insurance since the inception of Medicare in 1984. More than two million more Australians rely solely on the Medicare system than was the case some five years ago. If the proportion of Australians who take out private health insurance continues to fall at the rate of 3 per cent a year, it is anticipated it will cost the public hospitals an extra $150m per year to operate. I ask the Government where it is going to find that money. That is another hole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have a health care system where the number of Australians aged above 65 who have taken out private health insurance has increased from 755,000 in 1989 to 824,000 in 1991. I am talking about old people&mdash;many of whom are on pensions and cannot really find their way clear to take out private health insurance, yet they struggle to do so. It is hardly surprising that they do, given the parlous state of the public hospital system. Since those who maintain health insurance are more likely to be elderly and therefore use more hospital services, premiums will continue to rise at an alarming rate. That will drive more people out of the private health insurance system and it will drive the costs up again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to know&mdash;and perhaps Senator Crowley, Senator Loosley or somebody else will tell me&mdash;where are those opposite going to find the money for that purpose? I would also like to know the answer to that question because Mr Howe said that if the Government did not have a Medicare co-payment&mdash;and Senator Crowley, when she bothers to come into this debate, will tell me because she was one who opposed the Medicare co-payment last year and now it is being raised to 1.4 per cent&mdash;it would need a levy of 1.53 per cent. Where will it get the money? There is a gap there and there is a gap here as people move out of the private health insurance system into the public system. Where is it going to get the money?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have a health care system which is heralded as being free, but in reality funds obtained from the Medicare levy provide only 8 per cent of the total health care costs. As Senator Knowles said, members of the Australian public are being hoodwinked if they believe this 1.4 per cent Medicare levy will cover their health costs. No, they have been told an untruth again. Labor propaganda&mdash;that is what it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The injection of funds that we have had in this Budget for waiting lists will not bring about the kinds of structural reforms that are necessary to address the balance. What has happened is that we are seeing today the private hospital system protesting, as happened a few months ago with the public hospital system in an unprecedented show of strength, and telling us that the hospitals system is almost now no longer viable. </PARA>

He had no answers to our questions and only proceeded to tell untruths about the Opposition's Fightback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everyone knows that the Australian health system is in crisis. We have had the Minister for Health in Western Australian, Mr Keith Wilson, resigning. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the area of the hospital funding we have been left with a situation which I described at the hospital survival conference in Melbourne last May as the most inefficient and ramshackle hospital funding system one could imagine. It includes continuing the myth that the Medicare levy provides the funds.</PARA>
<PARA>We all know that is what the Government tries to push. We all know that it is an untruth. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This has meant that hundreds of thousands of ordinary Australians, including the 42 per cent of people over 65 who choose to be privately insured as a measure of securing ready access to hospital treatment without an undue wait for needed care, have been ignored. Ignored also is the majority of Labor supporters with private health insurance and the need to encourage people who could afford it to see the membership of private health funds as a means of supplementing scarce public funds needed to maintain high quality public hospital services.</PARA>
<PARA>He ended up saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Federal Health Minister, Brian Howe, has failed to recognise the role of private health insurers.</PARA>
<PARA>That is about the only thing I would disagree with him on. I think Mr Howe does recognise the role of private health insurers and will make sure he dumps them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have tens of thousands of people on waiting lists at public hospitals who are unable to gain access for urgent treatment. Some, indeed&mdash;and it is not too emotional to say so&mdash;die before getting that treatment. Yet the Government is so ideologically bound to destroy the private funds that it has spent $3.5m of taxpayers' money, instead of Labor Party funds, in the lead-up to the election for a propaganda campaign to try to sell Medicare and soften up the electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How far will the Government go in its efforts to destroy the private health system? Let us look at the blatant methods it uses. It has to be first understood that the Government's own Act requires that all health funds be registered in each State&mdash;that is, to stop funds shifting money from one State to another in an attempt to undercut the contribution rates of the competing funds. This would be so easy to do if it were permitted. However, the Minister and he alone may give permission for the shifting of that money if he chooses, but not&mdash;and I stress `not'&mdash;if he believes the moving of that money would allow this undercutting to occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at what has occurred. Medibank Private, the Government's own fund, as far back as 1983-84 transferred out of the Victorian branch $22.3m. That money was given to its branches in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania. This was done to enable the branches of Medibank Private in those States to meet their legal requirement to hold two months reserves of their contributions. Why were the branches in these States so short of money? Because they were busy undercutting their competitors in their States, thus giving them a greater market share. </PARA>

Yet the Minister turned a blind eye to this blatant predatory pricing exercise and gave the Victorian branch of Medibank Private permission to transfer its money. What happened? The Victorian branch, of course, had to have its turn to be rescued.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So in 1989-90 Medibank Private in Victoria lost $21.8m, and as stated in the last annual general report of the Health Insurance Commission 1990-91 it lost $41.7m. So&mdash;surprise, surprise&mdash;Medibank Private's branches in New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia came to the party and transferred money back into Victoria to rescue that branch so it could maintain its legal reserves with, of course, the Minister's permission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why did Victoria suffer this big loss? Because it was its turn to undercut its competitors in Victoria. This is how it did it. I will cite the family insurance cover in Victoria. Medibank Private's top cover in Victoria costs $24.70 with the basic cover being $17.47; MBF is well above, $33.90, with the basic cover being $21; HBA is $30 with the basic cover being $19.60; ANA is $38.60 with the basic cover being $21.40. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So in that year, with a loss of $41m, the Victorian branch of Medicare Private undercut all the other major health funds in that State. Yet the Minister, with this sort of evidence, this blatant predatory pricing, this blatant evidence of deliberate undercutting, gave Medibank Private permission in the New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australian branches to transfer money to shore up the Victoria funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is how the Government works; this is the Government's ideology&mdash;and, unless the Labor Party is thrown out of government, this will finally succeed in bringing down the health system.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are aware that the Government has set up an inquiry into hospital services chaired by Jenny Macklin. The Government always chooses the chairman if it wants a certain outcome and recommendations. One of the options she suggested for the Government to adopt was to extend the choice of doctor and hospital to all through a single national insurer. Is that Medibank Private? Let us have a look at what the Government's mates, the health insurance unions, say. A newspaper article states:</PARA>

<PARA>For heaven's sake, the Minister should not tell me that the Government's ideology is not blinkered and that it is not the Government's plan to get rid of the private health funds.

Anybody in Victoria could simply stand up and say, `Minister Tehan, you could reduce your waiting lists immediately'. Minister Tehan could be challenged by any Victorian about the fact that she is refusing to sign the Medicare agreement and take the money that the Commonwealth is waiting to pass over to her to reduce the waiting lists in the hospitals in Victoria.

The deliberately inflicted injuries that are caused in this country each year cost Australia a very great deal of money. In the national strategy on violence against women, it was estimated that, annually, there are about $286m worth of intentionally inflicted injuries identified in the hospital system.

As I instanced yesterday, a man in Western Australia was told that he would have to wait five months for an urgent coronary procedure. This was documented in the Western Australian newspapers. But we are told, `Don't worry about that. We are going to go along as we have in the past'. Is it any wonder that I get angry when I hear this unbelievable inability to comprehend what is occurring out there in the real world?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Government is proposing to us is not a response. What it is saying is, `We will contain health care costs. We will ration services'. Yet, the Government pretends that this is not occurring. The Government is about cost constraint. It talks very lovingly about the way in which the percentage of money spent on health care has been kept at 8 per cent of gross domestic product for the last 16 years. It talks lovingly about this great achievement. Little does the Government realise that at the same time we have had a rapidly ageing population and an explosion in technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal Party and the coalition have a plan that allows doctors to negotiate with insurance companies in relation to fees.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be delighted if the Opposition makes health an issue at the next Federal election and in particular focuses on Medicare. The simple fact of recent Australian history is this: since the inception of Medicare in 1984 there have been three Federal elections fought either principally or in secondary terms on the issue of health care and the Medicare universal health insurance system. Those three elections were won convincingly by the Labor Party. If the Opposition is keen to go down that road again in 1993, the result will be another defeat.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been some recent electoral experience in the United States on this issue&mdash;and I will say a little more about the American health system later on in my observations. I am referring not only to the presidential election in which Governor Clinton and Senator Gore focused on American health policy but also to a casual vacancy earlier this year in the United States Senate for the State of Pennsylvania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democratic candidate&mdash;a man by the name of Harris Wofford&mdash;campaigned primarily on health care. He focused upon some realities in the United States, including the fact that not only are there 40 million Americans without any form of health cover whatever, but also 60 million Americans are chronically underinsured. That means that in the overwhelming majority of cases people who fall sick or whose families encounter ill health are virtually assigned to a charity system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Wofford was elected to the United States Senate. For the first time in 30 years a Democrat had won a Senate seat for the State of Pennsylvania. A person by the name of James Carville took an interest in that campaign. He went on to become Governor Clinton's campaign director and was pivotal in Mr Clinton's election to the United States presidency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition does not have a good record in the area of health care. There is no question about that. That is not my judgment&mdash;that has been the judgment of the Australian people time and again. It is true at a Federal level. We heard from Senator Tate this afternoon that the objective is to oblige people to take out private health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also true at a State level. One only has to look at the New South Wales experience where the ideological cataracts have come into play with the rush to privatisation. It is true in Victoria with the obsession with downgrading conditions of working people, particularly nurses, in the health care system. As Senator Cook knows better than I, in recent times we have seen this happen under the Kennett Government. We have seen it at State level and we have seen it at a Federal level. The greatest risk to the health care of Australians is a coalition victory at a general election in 1993. This has been the case on the three preceding occasions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at Medicare. After some eight years, Medicare is still supported by over 70 per cent of Australians. Seven in 10 Australians still rate the system either satisfactory, good, or very good. That is an impressive record by world standards when we are talking about health insurance, health care and health cover. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no risk contained in the observation of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), as Senator Knowles would have the Senate believe. The observation is true. But it is also true that the Government does not have ideological cataracts in place. The Government does not have a problem with people taking private health insurance. The Government does not have a difficulty in seeing private health insurance balance out the public commitment to health care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, Medicare is built principally upon the original Medibank system of the Whitlam Government. I recall vividly the promise in November 1975 of one Malcolm Fraser, as the unelected Prime Minister, when he said, `Medibank will be retained and strengthened under a Liberal government'. What was the result after the general election of December 1975? That promise, like so many others of Fraser's and the coalition's since, was torn up. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The circumstances that exist in Australia at the moment are that, as a consequence of the 1992-93 Federal Budget, what the Government is about doing is building upon an already impressive record of achievement in the area of health. I have just a few points to make in the short period that remains to me. For example, the Government has implemented one of the most successful AIDS management programs in the world; there is no question about that on a comparative scale or an absolute scale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has fully embraced the recommendations of the Baume report into drug evaluation and is implementing the report's recommendations. That was a first class evaluation; the recommendations were first class and the response has been first class. The Government is paying particular attention to women's health programs through a $34m national women's health project, the $64m national program for the early detection of breast cancer, the $32m organised approach to preventing cervical cancer and the $6.5m alternative birthing services program. Those are facts. We are not talking here in terms of hyperbole about an alternative system that might or might not exist in the US&mdash;in the way the coalition wants us to believe it does. We are talking about the factual basis upon which Australian health care is built. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has also established the national Aboriginal health strategy and is spending $232m on a range of public health measures in Aboriginal communities. That is entirely appropriate. Senator Jones will be aware that the need is obvious and evident, particularly in Queensland. The Government has committed $8.5m over three years to providing training and support to rural health workers, another very worthwhile initiative taken by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take the point that Senator Lees made earlier about preventive health care. It was a very useful observation that she made and it is one with which in large measure I agree. But we ought to recognise also that the Government is working towards a healthier population through the $6.1m national health advancement program and the $40m national campaign against drug abuse. The Government has also launched a national food and nutrition policy and is developing expanded national health goals and targets. The Government has also committed $9m to developing and providing health services for at risk and homeless youth to help them take care of their own health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no question about the programs being in place; there is no question about the programs being worthwhile. It is also of value to look at the community response to the 1992-93 Budget. In an endorsement from the Australian Council of Social Service, ACOSS stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Health initiatives in the Budget reflect a theme of strengthening Medicare as the centrepiece of our public health system.</PARA>

<PARA>That is an observation made by people who are not normally associated with the policies of the Labor Government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consequences of Fightback would be to place public hospitals under increasing pressure by slicing at least $1.25 billion of government funding from their budgets. It would guarantee access to high quality health care for only the wealthy. Again, the American alternative comes into vogue.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, pursuant to Part 7 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Petroleum Resource Rent Legislation Amendment Act 1991, </EMPHASIS>I present the report on the operation of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Assessment Act 1987</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The introduction of the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax (PRRT), and the enhancements to PRRT introduced in the August 1990 Budget, were integral components of what has become a decade of micro-economic reform undertaken by the Government in the petroleum industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taking office in 1983, Labor found a petroleum industry subject to heavy Government control, and where uncertainty was undermining an industry already possessing a high degree of natural risk.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Moreover, in 1983, the outlook for Australia continuing to supply a high proportion of its oil needs from its own production was uncertain to poor.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the early 1980s, the then Bureau of Mineral Resources indicated that the domestic production of crude oil, condensate and naturally occurring LPG from existing and planned new developments would increase to 1985, but then decline. In the absence of substantial new discoveries, the reports indicated that Australia's level of self sufficiency would fall to somewhere about 30 per cent by the mid 1990s. These reports emphasised that new discoveries and developments would be essential in the forecast period if Australia's level of self sufficiency was to be maintained at the level then prevailing, some 66 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government addressed this challenge through a comprehensive program of fundamental reforms, designed to encourage a vigorous, dynamic and competitive petroleum industry. The Government's program of reform has included</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.deregulation of the oil and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) markets;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.implementation of an Offshore Exploration Strategy to facilitate the development of Australia's petroleum resources;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.fundamental change to secondary taxation; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the development of a National Gas Strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a consequence of the Government's policy reform agenda the gloomy picture foreseen by earlier forecasters has not emerged. The policy environment in which the industry operates has been changed beyond recognition; the industry has been re-vitalised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Real oil prices today are lower than they were following the first oil shock in 1974. Despite this, Australia has fared well in terms of investment in exploration and development in our offshore waters. Self-sufficiency currently stands at around 85 per cent. Furthermore, we can be optimistic about future prospects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ABARE, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, in its latest forecasts, noted that there was an excellent chance that oil production could be maintained at current levels or even increased, up to and beyond the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has overhauled the industry, and the results are there to be seen. The PRRT is an integral part of that reform program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The requirement to report on the operation of the PRRT Act arose out of the legislation that implemented the 1990 Budget reforms to PRRT. These reforms extended the PRRT to Bass Strait. They also introduced company-wide deductibility for exploration expenditure in all PRRT areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The PRRT is an efficient tax. Unlike other secondary taxes, it is levied only on the net income of a profitable project. It does not adversely affect production in times of changing prices and costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Moreover, the PRRT provides a reasonable balance between providing the private sector with adequate returns for the risks it takes in investing in petroleum exploration and development, and providing the community with a fair return on the use of its non renewable resources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decision in 1990 to extend the PRRT to the Bass Strait project was the outcome of an intensive review brought forward by the Government in the light of industry concerns evident at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The excise and royalty regime, which the PRRT replaced, had become too inflexible to adapt to changing market conditions. Frequent variations had become necessary with the result that the regime was complicated, and distorted investment and production decisions. The Bass Strait producers argued that they could invest a further $1 to $1.5 billion to extract an additional 200 to 300 million barrels of oil if the petroleum taxation arrangements were reformed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The impact of the tax changes is clear&mdash;the Bass Strait project has been rejuvenated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New developments currently under consideration include the construction of two new platforms at a combined cost of $650 million to extract a further 85 million barrels of oil.  Two other fields, containing a combined total of 16 million barrels, are also expected to become viable under the PRRT.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Major infill drilling and workover programs on existing platforms are currently estimated to add 150 million barrels of economically recoverable oil. Exploration activity has also surged, with big increases in both seismic surveying and exploration wells.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is clear that the fundamental impediments to further development identified by the Bass Strait producers have been removed. Furthermore, it is clear that the move to PRRT has avoided the situation where some production was stopped at low oil prices, because of the distorting tax regime.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The wider impact of the PRRT reforms also needs to be considered. Australia's offshore areas are only lightly explored. To ensure that the full potential of our resources is realised, we must create an environment that facilitates efficient exploration. The introduction in 1990 of company-wide deductibility for exploration expenditures against the PRRT removed a significant impediment to efficient offshore petroleum exploration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reforms  mean that new exploration decisions are driven by prospectivity and technical factors rather than by distortions in the taxation arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While it is too soon to fully assess the impact of this amendment to the PRRT, the signs are all positive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Petroleum Exploration Association has reported that wider deductibility appears to be diversifying exploration activity among its members.  Increased holdings of offshore acreage by local and international companies indicate that funds that may once have gone to areas abroad have been redirected to Australia. And activity in offshore frontier areas has remained very encouraging.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some industry submissions to the report raised concerns about the effect of the 1990 reforms on natural gas developments. One concern was the reduction in the premium on the carry forward rate for general project expenditure from 15 to 5 percentage points above the Commonwealth long term bond rate. It was argued that the reduced premium would impede the development of commercial gas projects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reduction in the premium reflected the significant benefits to industry that derived from the introduction of company-wide deductibility for exploration, and the relative risks of the different stages of a petroleum project.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The carry forward rates and the tax rate for the PRRT are part of a balanced and integrated package that includes wider deductibility for exploration expenditures. To preserve the community return, any adjustment in the carry forward rate for general expenditure would require a corresponding adjustment elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The issue raised has been carefully examined and there is no evidence that the current provisions are impacting adversely on developments. Therefore, changes will not be made to the carry forward provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will now turn to the concerns raised in connection with the impact of the PRRT on gas prices. Some submissions argued that the PRRT will directly impact on Victorian gas and ethane users with a consequential adverse impact on industry and employment. Requests for change were made in submissions by both the producers and their gas and ethane customers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bass Strait producers asked that gas and ethane revenues from the Bass Strait project be singled out for a specially reduced rate of taxation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is not prepared to accept this suggestion. The PRRT is a project tax, not a product tax. A change of this kind would reintroduce the type of taxation distortions on investment that characterised the former excise and royalty regime. The producers' request also ignores the windfall reduction in secondary tax that they received in the early years of the PRRT. It would undermine the legitimate community return from the project.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Users of natural gas and ethane asked the Government to regulate in some way the price of gas products from Bass Strait to ensure that the producers were not including a PRRT component.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this regard, it is worth highlighting that a number of factors intervene to determine gas prices to the consumer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, I want to reiterate that the PRRT is a project tax, not a product tax and again note the windfall gain in reduced secondary taxation in the early years of the PRRT received by the Bass Strait producers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Second, prices for gas and ethane are negotiated by the parties involved consistent with normal commercial practice. Whether PRRT falls under the definition of costs that can be passed on, is currently being decided by legal interpretation of the existing contracts and by arbitration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consistent with normal commercial practice, the Government would expect that once the legal standing of the contracts has been decided, negotiations will commence in regard to what amount, if any, of the PRRT will be passed on. These matters are best determined by the parties concerned and are currently being resolved by contractual arbitration and negotiation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A further factor relevant to natural gas prices in Victoria is the Victorian Government's Public Authority Contribution charge on the Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria.  In the 1990/91 financial year the Contribution amounted to $242 million.  In 1991/92 it was $265 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Victorian Government has the option of varying this charge which is three to four times the figures being discussed in relation to the PRRT.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One can observe that, in the absence of these charges, Victoria would have by far the cheapest gas in Australia, with an indicative city gate price for 1990-91 at Melbourne of 87 cents per gigajoule, compared with  $2.40 per GJ in Adelaide, and $2.85 in Sydney, based on figures from the Australian Gas Association. One can also observe that the Kennett Government has shown no compunction in raising Victoria's domestic gas prices by some 10 per cent since assuming office.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the light of these factors, the argument that the application of PRRT will be disruptive to end users of natural gas and ethane cannot be sustained. It is clear that there is no direct link between the PRRT and the price of natural gas and ethane to the consumer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nevertheless, the Government recognised that there were special circumstances affecting the prices for natural gas in Victoria. When the Government implemented the 1990 reforms to the PRRT it sought to minimise any potential transitional impacts on the Victorian natural gas market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth therefore provided the Victorian Government with a special grant of $60 million for the first two years of the application of the PRRT in Bass Strait. Following the grant, the then Victorian Government stated in the Victorian Parliament in May 1991 that it would become its responsibility to ensure that the application of the PRRT was not passed on. I am not aware of any change in this position following the change of Government in Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is clear that the PRRT provides the certainty and stability needed to attract long term investment in our petroleum exploration and production industry. The Government indicated at the time of the 1990 reforms that it would not be considering any further concessional changes to the arrangements for petroleum production taxation. Nevertheless in preparing this report I have given careful consideration to industry arguments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I can advise that the Government will further examine the restrictions on the transferability of expenditures on disposal of a partial interest in a project.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will consider issues such as whether a transfer of expenditures should be proportional to the interest in the project, whether each project category of expenditure should be transferred proportionally or whether it should be optional.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will also examine further the legislative provisions affecting the end of year transfer of exploration expenditures under farm-in arrangements that are commenced part-way through the financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this context we need to ensure that the policy objectives of company-wide deductibility are in fact being met, while ensuring that the PRRT does not inhibit risk sharing and management that are normal aspects of oil industry activity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I expect that an announcement on these matters will be made in the first quarter of 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government gave an undertaking to the Senate in June 1991 to include in this report details of the time taken to administer applications for project production licences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since 1985, the Commonwealth has received 14 applications for a production licence of which 13 have been awarded. In considering applications the Government needs to examine a number of resource management issues. Details of the processing of applications are included in the report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conclusion, Australia has a regulatory and taxation regime for petroleum exploration and development that makes us internationally competitive. This has been recognised internationally by respected, authoritative sources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report I table today shows that the Government's package of reforms for the industry are working.  New investments are going ahead in Bass Strait under the PRRT. The report also indicates that exploration activities in our offshore areas are no longer being affected by taxation that distinguishes between project and frontier areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the Government assumed office in 1983, it found a hopelessly over regulated petroleum industry, contemplating a declining role in meeting Australia's vital crude oil needs. The Government set about systematically freeing up the energies of the industry, with bold reform policies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Petroleum Resource Rent Tax is a key element of those reforms, providing a strong stimulus to the industry, while safeguarding the community's return for the use of its non-renewable resources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The PRRT is an excellent example of micro-economic reform introduced by this Government in the area of energy, and indeed the economy as a whole. It demonstrates the Government commitment to policies that will ensure a strong, competitive petroleum industry into the 21st century.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Walters for that comment. I shall return to that very relevant issue in the course of my remarks. This report which the Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook, has tabled and the accompanying statement are the result of the coalition's concerns about the impact of the resource rent tax, particularly on Victorian gas and ethane producers and users. Evidence before the Senate inquiry on the legislation, which was conducted in May and June 1991, indicated to those of us on the Senate Standing Committee that the Minister's assessment and that of his Department on the impact of this legislation was hotly contested by those who produced and consumed gas and ethane.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest to the Minister that this report will not lay to rest the significant criticisms that have been made regarding the impact of the Petroleum Resource Rent Legislation Amendment Act of 1991. The shadow Minister for resources and energy, Mr Tim Fischer, in the other place, has given the coalition's response to this report, but I would like to add some comments of my own. First, I want to make two general comments. I have expressed concern in this chamber on a number of occasions regarding how the Federal Government's actions have damaged Victoria. Madam Acting Deputy President, I know that you, as a senator from Victoria, will also share the concerns that I have about this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, there is no doubt that the politically driven mergers of Qantas and Australian Airlines, and Telecom and OTC certainly could have a serious effect on Victoria, where Australian Airlines and Telecom were once headquartered. The Defence Force restructuring, announced by Senator Ray, as I have said elsewhere, has also had a major adverse effect on Victoria. Naturally, I do think that defence policy must take account of wider issues. Nonetheless, we have to recognise that the impact of those decisions which were taken by Senator Ray and the Government have been particularly harmful to Victoria and, in particular, to employment in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Keating-driven merger of the State Bank with the Commonwealth Bank will also have the effect of further major job losses in Victoria. Madam Acting Deputy President, you will be aware that Minister Griffiths appears from time to time in the press suggesting how particular actions that he has taken, given his various responsibilities, have benefited his home State. I suggest to you that moving the headquarters of CSIRO to Melbourne, welcome as it is, hardly compensates for the loss of Australian Airlines and the likely consequences flowing from the loss of the split headquarters which exist now of AOTC. The Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Collins, is now in the chamber. He will be aware of the concerns which I have expressed in that area. One only has to read the recent submissions made to the Minister's Department, the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, on the resources rent tax to get the feeling that Victoria continues to strike out as far as this Government is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second general point I wish to make is that the Minister refers to the resource rent tax as `an excellent example of micro-economic reform'. The reality is that this Keating Government and, before it, the Hawke Government wimped out on most areas of micro-economic reform and, in particular, taxation reform. If the Government were truly concerned about encouraging industry in Victoria and elsewhere in Australia, it would support and, indeed, initiate the removal of job destroying taxes such as the payroll tax and the fuel excise tax. Madam Acting Deputy President, you will recall, as a member of the Labor Party, that Mr Keating himself said some years ago that the removal of the payroll tax would lead to an additional 200,000 jobs around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government, if it were truly concerned about reforming the taxation area, would listen to the concerns of industry and junk the wholesale sales tax mess. But of course, on the big issues of micro-economic reform, the Government inevitably shows a remarkable lack of concern for Australia's real national interests and tends to highlight what it sees as the narrow, short term interests of its own Party, the Labor Party. The Minister in the tabling statement and in the report concedes that insufficient time has elapsed to be completely definitive about the impact of the resources rent tax on the petroleum exploration and production industry. Surprisingly, he then goes on to argue that early indications are that the RRT is meeting its objectives. He further advises in the tabling statement that the Government will give further consideration to some changes in relation to associated taxation aspects of the resources rent tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Happily, I believe time is running out for this Government and for this Minister. The coalition believes that the problems which have been highlighted in relation to Victoria remain, despite the Minister's whitewash. The problems have been highlighted in the many submissions in relation to pricing, market distortions and investor confidence which have flowed from the imposition of the resources rent tax without proper consultation with people in the industry. The Kennett Government in Victoria also has concerns, naturally, about the effect of the resources rent tax in relation to the private sector cogeneration industry and its impediment to interstate trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry itself has highlighted a number of problems relating to the resources rent tax. First, it argues that it is a barrier to interstate trade in gas; second, that it will lead to higher gas prices in Victoria; third, that there will be less incentive to explore and develop gas, and fourth, it warns that some gas reserves will be left in the ground. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that none of these issues has been adequately addressed in the report tabled today. The Minister has shown that he will not listen to industry. He may like to re-read&mdash;or perhaps read for the first time&mdash;the submission that was lodged by the former Labor Government in Victoria. In regard to the competitiveness of major Victorian gas users, the former Victorian Government argued in its submission:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst many factors contribute towards private sector investment decisions, a number of proposals have been deferred indefinitely and others face uncertainty as a major consequence of the potential impact of RRT on Victoria's national and international competitiveness. This applies not only to the general manufacturing sector but also to the petrochemical industry which, as a major consumer of ethane as well as natural gas, will be placed in an untenable national and (notably) international competitive position.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These substantial difficulties will not be resolved until the immediate threat of RRT pass-on under existing contracts is overcome&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and, as the Minister at the table knows, that is a very big issue in Victoria which is causing major concern amongst the gas producers&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . but more particularly, not until the longer term threat of the now higher tax regime on gas is eliminated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is economically dispiriting for Victorian manufacturing industry to realise that a number of its international competitors are purchasing natural gas from the North West Shelf project, where a significantly lower tax regime is applied compared to that for Bass Strait.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further harm will be done to Victorian industry as a consequence of its interstate competitors acquiring gas supplies from onshore petroleum projects, where significantly lower tax regimes also apply.</PARA>
<PARA>While perhaps one would not agree with every word put in that submission by the former Victorian Government, one would have to say that it highlighted major concerns which are certainly felt in our home State, Madam Acting Deputy President. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to illustrate the consequences of this legislation for investment and employment in Victoria, let me cite a number of specifics which the Minister might care to investigate. The Pratt group planned to invest in co-generation facilities for its paper recycling plant at Coolaroo. But a significant factor affecting the viability was the additional RRT payable on gas. However, similar plants operate in New South Wales, and Victoria is missing out on investment in this relatively new, environmentally friendly technology. I think that you, Madam Acting Deputy President, will be concerned to learn that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another case that has been brought to my attention relates to the Geelong based cement factory. As you know, Madam Acting Deputy President, Geelong is an area in Victoria which is particularly depressed and which suffered greatly as a result of a number of disasters which afflicted the former Government in Victoria. Pioneer holds a 50 per cent share in this factory, which is a major Victorian gas user. Gas is cheaper in New South Wales, South Australia and Japan, and this means that the cement produced in, say,</PARA>
<PARA>South Australia can be produced at a lower marginal cost than it can in Victoria. The cost of producing cement at the Victorian plant is already four times that of the same company's Kandos plant in New South Wales, which uses brown coal, a less environmentally friendly fuel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to have a number of further comments recorded in this chamber. The report fails to distinguish between two very different products of the industry&mdash;oil and gas. The report focused largely on oil and often missed the point about the needs and concerns of the gas industry. I believe the report also contains a logical fallacy. It wrongly links the proposed Bass Strait development with the recent introduction of the RRT. In reality, other options were available that would not have had the severe negative consequences for Victorian gas and ethane. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the report is largely a whitewash. Very worryingly, it ignores the big impact that the application of the RRT to gas users can have on the future of Victorian industry. One of the big issues which appeared before the Committee related to the compensation arrangements which the Government decided to make to compensate Victorian gas users and producers for any possible flow-on effects in order to help moderate those effects. Sixty million dollars was provided to the Victorian Government for this compensation package. Senator Loosley will be interested to know that that money was paid into Consolidated Revenue&mdash;paid to the Kirner Government. None of it, as far as I am aware, has been paid out as compensation. In fact, it has been pointed out that that may well have to wait until a number of court cases are decided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, as honourable senators know, that Victorian Government, as a result of the mismanagement of the Cain and Kirner years, was running a very substantial deficit. I suggest that the $60m has been spent. Naturally the liability involved will be incorporated in the Forward Estimates. Presumably, when the time comes, further money will have to be raised. In any case, I look forward to receiving any comments that the Victorian Government, or the relevant Minister, Mr Jim Plowman, may have on that issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we saw in Victoria was a vast black hole which swallowed money up from all areas. Sixty million dollars was paid into the Consolidated Revenue account and I believe that it has, in a practical sense as distinct from a technical and legal sense, already been used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of us were waiting anxiously for the report that the Minister was required to produce in assessing the impact of the legislation. Certainly given the time period involved one accepts that not all definitive judgments can be made. But it is clear from the very extensive submissions that have been provided to the Department&mdash;which I have had a brief chance to skim through&mdash;that there are very widespread concerns in Victoria about aspects of the resource rent tax. As a person who is particularly concerned to make sure that Victoria gets back on its feet and that we recover rapidly from the disaster of the Cain and Kirner years, I say that I would have liked to see the Minister more effectively addressing in this report the concerns which many producers and consumers of natural gas and ethane have brought to his attention. </PARA>

<PARA>These two documents give the Senate some indication of the relationship between Australia and the World Bank and the operations of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank over very recent times. Membership of the IMF is open to every country that conducts its own foreign policy and will adhere to the fund's charter. In that respect, Australia joined the IMF in August 1947. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since joining the Fund, Australia has been the largest quota holder in its IMF constituency. That constituency currently includes the Republic of Korea, New Zealand, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu, Western Samoa, the Solomons, the Seychelles and Kiribati. Australia nominates the executive director who can speak within the executive board on behalf of each constituent separately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is of interest to note that Mongolia joined the IMF on 14 February 1991 and has asked our constituency's executive director to take charge of its interests in the period leading up to the next election to be held in September of 1992 when it is anticipated that Mongolia will formally join our IMF constituency. Our relationship with the International Monetary Fund is reflected in the consultations which occurred in 1988 and again last year by way of review of Australian trade and industry policies, with a particular focus on Australia's position on the various Uruguay Round issues. It is now a matter of history that Australian leadership, through the Cairns Group of countries and our relentless efforts to liberalise world trade, will almost certainly meet with success in a conclusion to the Uruguay Round in 1993, following the breakthrough in GATT between the United States and the Europeans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also of consequence to note that in September last year Australia formally moved from the European Department to the South East Asian and Pacific Department of the International Monetary Fund. Australia's trade and economic priorities lie increasingly with the Asia-Pacific region and Australia should and, in my view, will benefit from a greater understanding in the IMF of Australian economic links with the Asia-Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fair to say that the IMF has become an influential agent for promoting and cementing international economic change. However, it should also be stressed that it must be of increasing importance to the International Monetary Fund that it take note in its deliberations of the social agenda which is involved in making evaluations; that it take note of the different cultural values in each country within our constituency and beyond and display a sensitivity to those values, to the political climate and to the history of the member nations involved. That has not always been the case, though in our region the performance, for example, has been much better than it was a decade or so ago in Latin America. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no question that a significant feature of IMF operations is the consultation process which accompanies its lending activities. It is of real consequence to make certain that negotiations between the Fund and the recipient country are on the basis of common objectives and equal responsibilities in the relationship. There is no doubt that, for example, in the view of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, IMF programs are generally effective in encouraging countries to adopt policies which will maximise potential for long term, stable economic growth. We really need to see a great deal more of that in the future, especially in our region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the World Bank, Australia has given a high priority to active policy discussion between donor and recipient, both bilaterally and multilaterally, through international forums. Through its projects and programs, the World Bank has demonstrated an increasing emphasis on policy dialogue and conditionality. The Bank has made a contribution to global growth and development. That contribution has been positive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In performing its economic policy leverage function, the Bank has been able to persuade borrowing countries to adopt economic policies which will improve prospects for growth. In conclusion, I stress the need for sensitivity and discretion and the need to take into consideration the cultural values, the political histories, the traditions, the social agendas of the individual recipient countries, and the need for equal rights and equal and common purpose between donor countries and recipients. </PARA>

<PARA>There are many issues which this report raises which have become of more importance and immediate concern to parents throughout Australia. Indeed, the recent furore over the screening of violent films and material on television before 8.30 at night, which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) raised as an issue only last month, has been of concern to many in the community for a number of years. This report says on page 21:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The primary responsibility for protecting children and young people from harmful material rests with their parents or guardians. In discharging that responsibility they have a right to expect assistance from the State, especially as films and videos are so readily accessible.

Children and young people, in particular, must be adequately protected from material likely to harm or disturb them, and people who may be offended by certain material have a right to expect that it will not be thrust upon them against their will or without warning.</PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Equally, the community has the right to ban material considered likely to endanger public health or safety, or to offend accepted standards of public decency.</PARA>
<PARA>The problem which has developed over recent years in Australian society is that these accepted standards of public decency seem to be constantly changing&mdash;not as a result of growing agitation by the parents and families of middle Australia, nor as a result of a general referendum of middle Australia. They are changing because of the growing pressure provided by the ever-increasing number of special interest lobby groups&mdash;groups which have money to make and spend in the promotion of the burgeoning pornography, sex and erotica industries. This is in contrast to parents who are struggling to provide their families with a decent standard of living and decent expectations. </PARA>

The Employment and Skills Formation Council has brought down a report, commonly known as the Carmichael report, detailing these deficiencies in the current system and making far-reaching recommendations towards improving vocational training in education in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, this Government sees a solution to the problems of training in setting up yet another bureaucracy&mdash;the Australian National Training Authority, ANTA. This begs the question: why has the Government so little confidence in its current advisory structure; why is ANTA not under the purview of NBEET's Skill Formation Council? While Labor has undertaken some belated initiatives within the last year, over its 10 years of government it has never adopted a comprehensive strategy to raise the level of skills in Australia to international levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Successful countries in this field, such as Germany and Japan, have long surpassed Australia in the provision of training skills for their young people. In a culture which rewards and admires achievement in the attainment of excellence, such as that in Germany, there is clear well resourced, well funded and industry recognised training schemes and a great diversity of training opportunities. In Germany almost 80 per cent of teenagers, virtually all those not attending universities or colleges, are undertaking some form of training course. This does not compare particularly favourably with Australia which has a national average of only 21 per cent of young Australians receiving vocational education. The OECD average is 50 per cent. Clearly, the plight of this neglected sector of education has in fact deteriorated under this Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fortunately, however, the coalition recognises the importance of this sector. We believe it is essential to move towards national reporting of standards of attainment based on assessment of key competencies required for success in the workplace. Vocational training should be provided in a wide variety of ways appropriate to the range of needs of those seeking training, including the needs of those at different stages of their career. As far as possible, funding should be directed to the people rather than the courses and the institutions. Under the coalition's Fightback policy, over the next three years we will spend $945m on the expansion of vocational education, thus providing over 225,000 new training places. This funding commitment is an increase of $225m over the Keating commitment for TAFE. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the present Government has failed in what it has done in this area and has now moved to try to be seen as doing something by setting up yet another bureaucracy called ANTA. The Government, in the way it is establishing the Australian National Training Authority, looks like it is going to repeat the mistakes that it made with the universities when it established the national unified system and insisted at that stage on intrusive measures, such as course profiles. We note that with the setting up of ANTA it is going to do exactly the same thing again. It is time for this Government to act effectively and reverse these centralist policies so that Australian youth do not continue to fall further behind in the international race. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>The report on research funding programs for 1992 comes up every year, and each year the Australian Research Council makes available grants for scientific and academic research which is conducted by our tertiary institutions. Such research often plays a very valuable role in developing our understanding of humanitarian issues or in providing answers to life threatening diseases. I believe that it is fair to say that over the years Australian institutions have held their heads high internationally with the standard of their research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year the Australian Research Council has allocated $77m in total. Whilst I have no concern whatsoever with the value of the research, I must take this occasion today to question the priorities which the Australian Research Council places on its funding allocations. I have on previous occasions in this place, as Senator Sowada would know, pointed out grants made by the Research Council which I believe would provide little benefit to the people of Australia. Reading through the grants allocated by the Council this year, I am once again forced to draw the conclusion that a great deal of money given by the Council for research could have been better spent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should remember that we are in a nation where one million people are out of work, where hundreds of Australians tonight will be forced to sleep on the streets, and where many young children tonight will go to bed without a meal. In that situation I find it totally unacceptable for the Australian Research Council to allocate $20,000 for a study of the history of tourism in fascist Italy. I find it similarly amazing that the Council should see fit to allocate $31,000 for an analysis of the visual representations of witchcraft in early modern Europe. The Council also allocated $35,000 for a study of the rise and fall of German communism. No doubt someone will be interested in that, but I have great difficulty in resolving how our nation's pending school leavers, who will find themselves looking for a job, will derive any benefit whatsoever from a $16,500 study on the structure of the British Raj in India from 1937 to 1947. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The list of grants which surely are open to question is endless but includes a study, for instance, of nineteenth century French romantic song, an analysis of family, work and class in middle class Malaysia, and it is probably the third study that I can remember relating to the eighteenth century Irish Parliament. If we want to throw in another bizarre area of research, we are to spend $15,500 of taxpayers' money on a study of the culture of the Stawell Gift. I suppose next year we will see a study into the Adelaide Grand Prix and perhaps there might even be a study of the culture of the Melbourne Cup. But we are talking about hundreds of thousands of taxpayers' dollars&mdash;indeed, millions of dollars&mdash;which should be put to better use in benefiting all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note with interest that in an <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> article on 16 September, the Chairman of the Council, Professor Max Brennan, indicated that some of the Council's critical fellowship programs were likely to close if there were not more Government support. I would argue very strongly that Professor Brennan should consider exactly where the Council is placing its funds, because money which is simply being wasted on schemes such as I have outlined here today could be diverted to areas of the fellowship program which will be of real benefit to all Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the annual report of the Australian Research Council, which I have to say is one of my favourite reports in that it displays to the Parliament and the Australian public the tremendous variety of research currently in progress in universities around Australia. It never ceases to amaze me what that variety consists of and Senator Calvert has expressed to the Parliament this afternoon some of the very specific research projects that have been funded in this report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there are a number of points that need to be made about the Australian Research Council and I will take this opportunity to do so. The 1992 research budget has increased to $255.5m from $230.9m in 1991. This certainly represents an increase and we commend the Government for it, but closer examination of the report will clearly illustrate the enormous and unprecedented stress upon our research institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put on the record here that nowhere in this report was I able to find any comparison of research grants from last year to this year, which certainly hindered my appreciation of the work done by the ARC and the nature and scope of research work in Australia at the moment. A quick comparison of the grants from 1991 to 1992 showed that there has been an unprecedented increase in the amount of money and the demands placed upon the Australian Research Council. For example, applications and requests for grants in the social sciences jumped from 383 applications, both new and continuing, in 1991, to 462 new and continuing applications for funding, which represents more than a 20 per cent increase in the applications for grants in social sciences alone. In humanities the number went up from 273 in 1991 to 306. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can go through the report fairly quickly and see that there really has been tremendous stress placed on the available funds. This stress has been generated by the fact that many of the newer universities created under the Dawkins amalgamations feel the need to engage in very broad and wide-ranging research projects in order for them to somehow be seen as a legitimate university engaging not only in undergraduate teaching, but a broad postgraduate program as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This increased demand on the total pool of funds for research has placed enormous stress especially on the older research institutions such as Melbourne University, Sydney University and those which have a very large research base. It has meant that everybody has been squeezed for funding and enormous stress has been placed on those institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is always exciting to examine the broad range of research. I notice that archaeological research has received a handsome slice of money. I would point out that Australia is very active in the eastern Mediterranean in many countries which have ancient remains. For example, the remains of Jebel Khalid in Syria have been the subject of research by the ANU for some years and that research has received a very nice grant of $65,000. I commend Professor Graeme Clarke to the Senate who, of course, is an internationally renowned scholar and whom we are very fortunate to have here in Australia at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The work done by Monash University at Ismant El-Gharab in the Dakhleh Oasis is again very important work on a very little understood site in what is a very poorly understood period of Egyptian history. I recall visiting that site in 1991 to escape the Gulf war in the Middle East and being  absolutely astonished by the size of the remains existing in the desert oasis of El Dakhleh, and actually witnessing the inscribed papyrus being excavated by the archaeologists who were literally finding papyrus in the sand by the bagful. Believe me, that is a very unusual, rare and special experience for anyone who has worked in the field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to suggest to Senator Calvert that, whilst many research grants might seem somewhat obscure, they are given by the Australian Research Council for a very good purpose. These grants are scrutinised very carefully and it is certainly not for this Parliament to call into question the quality of the work being done by Australian scholars. I am sure that the Research Council has given all these grants the very best scrutiny and the scholars who have received them well deserve them. </PARA>

<PARA>This report deals with scrutiny in action by the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances in respect of two Public Service determinations which prejudice the rights of Commonwealth employees. In this context I note that the year 1992 was the bicentenary of the publication of Tom Paine's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Rights of Man</EMPHASIS>, one of the most important and influential works on personal liberties, and a work which incidentally influenced me greatly in my youth. Therefore, it is particularly appropriate that the Committee has taken the action that it has and upon which I now report to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These determinations made by a departmental official removed an injustice for one category of employees, but entrenched a similar injustice for some 30,000 other former employees. The position of these employees was described by the Merit Protection and Review Agency as anomalous, unfair and inequitable. In the course of its inquiries the Committee found that the administering authorities had known about this unjust situation for almost 20 years. Eventually the Committee accepted an undertaking to provide express one-line Budget appropriations totalling $4.1m to recompense the disadvantaged employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A notable feature of the Committee's scrutiny was the support it received from the three Ministers who became involved.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the second major cognate debate on taxation matters today. It is great to see the Senate getting on with business. The Bills in this package cover very diverse areas such as the Medicare levy, income tax and dividend and interest withholding tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I deal first with the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill (No. 2). This is quite an historic piece of legislation. It is one of the first deliberate moves by this Labor Government in years to consciously and proudly increase a progressive income tax measure so as to finance the provision of better public health facilities and service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is interesting to take an international perspective or at least to take a comparison, because we have the incredible situation of President-elect Clinton winning an historic victory on a platform of introducing a national health system in the United States. Most people would be aware that in the United States if one does not have health insurance, one does not get health care. It is a classic market model which accepts that tens of millions of people will be totally disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unclear to me why the Opposition wishes to go back to the private insurance model which will simultaneously increase the total cost of national health care and&mdash;perhaps this is the reason&mdash;increase the profits of the private health insurers. It will increase the income of specialists and others with scarce skills, which have been provided by the public education system, and ensure that many people will become uninsured and hence will be vulnerable to financial ruin if a tragedy befalls their family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a huge problem in Australia with the efficient allocation of resources in our economy. We have a permanent shortage of development capital which continues to force many entrepreneurs to give up or to go overseas with their inventions. This shortage of capital must be exacerbated if we divert more of our total resources into health costs. We spend about 8 per cent of GDP on health costs. The United States, with its Fightback style health system, spends over 11 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So why is the Opposition proposing these kinds of changes? The United States has one of the highest infant mortality rates in the West and it has lower life expectancy than in Australia. The simple fact is that a national health system is more successful, more economically efficient and much more equitable. Health is a special case; I think it needs to be recognised as such. The Democrats support this measure as, I believe, so do most Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also two omnibus taxation Bills, Nos 5 and 6 for the year, which cover the usual diverse range of matters. Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) 1992 is not contentious. The legislation proposes, among other things, to simplify the administration of the prescribed payments system which will allow many businesses to go on to an annual system of reporting rather than the current monthly system. The legislation also proposes to provide a tax exemption to the new family payment advance. From 1 January, recipients will be able to elect to receive half of their family payments in a lump sum in advance. These payments are exempt from tax when received periodically and this amendment will ensure that lump sums are also exempt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the Government should be commended on this initiative. It is good social policy to allow families the flexibility of deciding whether they need all of their entitlements on a regular basis, or whether they might like to effectively commute some of their future benefits into a larger amount to enable them to afford important purchases such as school uniforms, to enable them to pay overdue bills, to top up the family holiday or to buy Christmas or birthday presents. It is fair, but it is also politically astute, especially its timing, and I think it will prove to be popular in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major revenue measure, possibly the most controversial, especially if one takes the view of Senator Campbell, concerns the proposal to treat limited partnerships as companies for taxation purposes. Currently, partnerships and limited partnerships are not taxed as separate entities, but the individual partners are taxed on their particular proportionate entitlement. This also means that partners can claim a proportionate share of a partnership loss. On the other hand, companies and certain public unit trusts are separately taxed and shareholders cannot claim a proportion of corporate losses. Instead, these are available to be carried forward to be offset against future profits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Limited partnerships are different from ordinary partnerships in that they are created under specific State legislation. Most partners can limit their liability in much the same way as shareholders, but still obtain the benefits of an entitlement to tax losses. Hence, they are a perfect tax planning vehicle. This legislation proposes to tax new partnerships as companies from the Budget date and for those existing at that time from 1995-96. </PARA>

There are many and varied options. For example, we might be able to support the proposal, but put in a mechanism whereby the Federal Government could declare that some limited partnerships were exempt from the tax. This would mean, for example, that the Federal Government could assist a particular project like a harbour tunnel, but this would be at the discretion of the Federal Treasurer, who would presumably weigh up the tax cost against the other benefits of the particular development. Indeed, this could be an important industry policy instrument. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before dinner, I started to make some remarks on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill, which we are discussing this evening. This Bill also contains some important taxation proposals. The major provision concerns the allowance of some environmental expenditure as an immediate tax deduction and the allowance of depreciation on other environmental capital expenditure which is not currently allowed. This is a major sustainable development initiative. It is similar, although more restricted, than the measures that the Australian Democrats recommended in our alternative Budget this year entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Getting to work</EMPHASIS>. I will discuss this measure in greater detail a little later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the gift provisions concerning donations to environmental organisations are being redrafted and broadened. There will be a register of groups for which a tax deduction will be allowed. Entry onto or removal from the register will be by agreement between the Treasurer and the environment Minister through an executive order which is not reviewable by the Parliament. This system follows the model established for arts bodies, which was also introduced to stop the practice of funnelling money through bodies that qualified for deductions to bodies not entitled to deductions on direct contributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tax deductibility for interest on money borrowed to finance superannuation contributions will be terminated. The timing of this decision suggests that it is a reaction to a ruling issued earlier this year which granted deductibility for the interest incurred by taxpayers in borrowing money to contribute to a superannuation fund. Clearly, it is absurd for the tax system to favour borrowing funds to invest in a savings vehicle. The point of granting tax concessions for superannuation is to increase the level of savings. Borrowing to fund superannuation is clearly unproductive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Royalties paid to non-residents will be subjected to a final withholding tax. This is subject to the various double tax treaties to which Australia is a signatory. This is not the time for a full debate on the standard treaty model. However, it is clear that it is designed to assist capital exporting countries relative to capital importing ones. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia suffers from a perpetual shortage of capital, and we are disadvantaged by the structure of these treaties. This issue needs to be taken up at the international level. The structure of the standard international treaty penalises capital importing countries and needs to be reformed. This measure will raise $50m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that nobody has a monopoly on good ideas&mdash;I also know that this is a bit nitpicky, but I want to get it on the record anyway&mdash;but today it was asserted that the 25 per cent increase in the zone rebate provision was discovered by the coalition. We have sponsored this initiative for years in our alternative Budgets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The capital gains tax provisions have been rewritten in order to clarify them. As previously announced, the provisional tax uplift factor is being reduced from 10 per cent to 8 per cent. This is a welcome move. Given the very weak growth currently occurring in Australia, we think that the Government could have been even more generous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second area of amendment in the provisional tax regime is the relaxation of the penalty provision section 221YDB. This provision is hated by taxpayers as it imposes a liability on people who vary their provisional tax and get their estimated income wrong by more than 10 per cent. This Bill relaxes that 10 per cent test to 15 per cent. The Democrats support it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Technical amendments are made to the tax treatment of the disposal of securities. The very generous horse breeding concessions are reduced, but I think they still remain very generous.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the few minutes left, I will return to the environmental protection expenditure proposal. Environment protection expenditure is expenditure incurred for the sole or dominant purpose of preventing, combating or rectifying pollution of the environment or treating, cleaning up, removing or storing waste. The deduction is constructed in a very complex manner, but basically it is designed to grant a deduction to directly environmentally related expenditure which does not currently qualify for any taxation relief, either by way of an immediate deduction or by way of depreciation over a number of years. Therefore, expenditure not now deductible, such as the costs of removing contaminated soil from an industrial site, will become fully deductible. Similarly, certain earthworks which are not deductible or depreciable will now become depreciable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the installation of, for example, pollution control plant or equipment will not obtain immediate deductibility but will continue to be depreciable over a number of years. As a consequence, this new measure will not stimulate new sustainable development investment, as this type of investment will continue to be treated like any other investment. By that, I mean that it will be subject to the ordinary accelerated depreciation rules. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats believe that we need to advantage specific expenditure so as to stimulate the introduction of pollution and waste control equipment and the introduction of renewable energy and energy efficient equipment and the retro-fitting of existing structures&mdash;for example, by installing insulation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1992. As the coalition representative on science and technology in this chamber, I will be restricting myself simply to that part of the Bill which addresses the research and development taxation concession. By way of background, the Bill contains a number of important elements in this regard. First, it provides the indefinite extension of the taxation concession for business expenditures on research and development at a rate of 150 per cent. Secondly, it removes the limit of $10m that currently applies to pilot plant used in research and development activities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The full cost of pilot plant acquired or commenced to be constructed on or after 19 August 1992 will be able to be claimed over three years as research and development expenditure. Third, the Bill denies the research and development concession to companies involved in syndicates or other financial schemes where investors are guaranteed a return on their investment. This includes government bodies such as universities and the CSIRO. Finally, the Bill strengthens the Industry Research and Development Board with respect to the actions that it can take when finance schemes do not meet research and development tax deductibility guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should say at the outset that the coalition supports the intentions of the Bill with respect to the research and development taxation concession. It would be well known to honourable senators that the Government had intended to reduce the concession to 125 per cent from June 1993. At the last minute, just before the Budget was announced, the Government had a change of heart and determined that the existing 150 per cent concession should remain for an indefinite period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition supports the continuation of the concession at the 150 per cent rate. However, unlike the Government, the coalition understands that encouragement of investment in research and development cannot be left to the taxation concession alone. If one takes the trouble to look at Australia's position in the world with respect to research and development, the consequences of this one-track policy are clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our total gross expenditure on research and development as a percentage of GDP is 1.23 per cent. The OECD average is 1.87 per cent. The large public research and development makes even this sad comparison look better than it is. Business spending on research and development, one of the crucial indicators of industrial performance and competitiveness, looks worse still. Australia ranks sixteenth out of 19 OECD countries which have measurable levels of private sector research and development expenditures. Australia's rate of business expenditure in business enterprises on research and development is 0.51 per cent of GDP; compare that with the OECD where the average is 1.18 per cent of GDP&mdash;about double. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be clear that the level of private sector expenditure on research and development in this country is woeful, and the current Government has done very little to address this situation, for all its talk. The taxation concession at 150 per cent is important but it is not enough by itself. What more is the Government prepared to do? The answer, sadly, is nothing. The Government has no new policies and no agenda for change&mdash;yet another area where we have a tired Government bereft of ideas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A Keating Government only promises more of the same. For a private sector starved of incentive, this means a level of investment in research and expenditure which falls far short of the world's best standards. The private sector has to be provided with greater incentive to invest in research and development. The coalition is responsive to that need. We will be providing this incentive through the reform of the business tax regime and through reform of the labour market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government simply is not doing enough and it is not prepared to tackle the major reforms that are necessary to encourage a self-supporting private sector research and development effort. The taxation concession is only one step in that direction. It is one part of a broad economic assessment carried out by companies when they are reflecting on their capacity to invest in the developmental and commercialisation phases of a new product or a new production process. The cost of capital, labour productivity, business input costs and the efficiency and structure of supply networks are all crucial factors. On every one of these we find that the coalition's Fightback plan has a positive impact. By extension, this means a positive impact on research and development investment by the private sector. By contrast, the Labor Government seems to think that the taxation concession is all that is required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind you, Mr Deputy President, of the Government's failure to implement one of the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee&mdash;of which you were the Chairman and I was a member&mdash;inquiring into the education of gifted and talented children which are needed in this country. If ever a country needed its gifted and talented, Australia does now. These are the very people who will benefit from any increase in research and development in this country and who will benefit Australia by that research and development. Mr Deputy President, you must feel as sad as I do at the failure of your Government to take any action on the education of the gifted and the talented children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the context of a government lacking imagination and failing to forward ideas or inspire confidence, it should not surprise us that the Government's science White Paper, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Developing Australian ideas</EMPHASIS>, has sunk almost without trace, rather like our Committee's report into gifted and talented children. In opinions which have been widely reported in the media, the White Paper has been described as underwhelming and has been criticised for failing to tackle the real problems in the science portfolio. We have been told that the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free) has been living down to his nickname of `Agenda Free'. It has even been said that the only good thing to come from the White Paper was the Government's decision to retain the 150 per cent tax concession on business research and development. As I have said, we have adopted the 150 per cent rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also support the other provisions contained in this Bill in relation to the taxation concession. For instance, the Government has drastically reduced the likelihood of any future abuse of the concession. The Bill ensures that the concession is available only to those businesses which are engaging in genuinely high risk investments. As my colleague Peter McGauran, the shadow Minister for science, has pointed out in the other place, this has always been a concern to the coalition parties over the years. We have raised the issue publicly on a number of occasions. It is pleasing that, after defending its failure to act for so long, the Government has at last accepted the arguments of the coalition on the need for a tightening of the applicability of the research and development concession. It is yet another example of the agenda free Labor Party being led by the coalition with a very busy, active and innovative agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I repeat the coalition's support for the research and development taxation concession initiatives contained in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1992, but it is clear that much more needs to be done. If we can allow companies to operate in an internationally competitive low cost environment&mdash;an environment which allows them the basic right to exact internationally competitive rates of return on capital and labour&mdash;increased levels of expenditure on research and development will follow. In the long term, that is the only effective strategy. In simple terms, it is clear that this tired, policy-bereft Government cannot do this, but the coalition will. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is there a hyena in the House, Mr Deputy President? I was able to tell Senator Knowles that she clearly does not know&mdash;and certainly will not hear, if I tell her; that is all right, she will still remain ignorant&mdash;that through Mr Peter Shack the Opposition claimed that there were 100,000 people on the waiting lists of this country, and in its Fightback document, which is a mere 12 months old, it assesses that figure at 60,000 people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Either the Labor Government has been dramatically effective in the last couple of years in terms of the waiting lists dropping by 40,000 or the Opposition knows that the figures on waiting lists are very rubbery and concedes that its previous figures were too high. The Government has put money into reducing waiting lists. Over three years the Commonwealth has allocated $50m which was matched by $50m from the States. As a result, the waiting lists fell. It is quite clear that if one targets expenditure one can reduce the waiting lists. Indeed, that is why in the recent Budget the Government has put up $70m over the next two years to deal with the size of the waiting lists which, quite clearly, is not acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also true that under the Medicare agreements it has been possible to contract public beds in the private hospitals. I was saying this afternoon that that is something which has been done very successfully in my own State as well as in New South Wales. The private hospitals were very pleased to cooperate with the public system. They have been able to use their spare capacity beds to help reduce the waiting lists. This particularly applies to pensioner patients waiting for eye surgery and orthopaedic surgery. Reliable data indicates that these specialty needs have been a problem in terms of waiting lists since the late 1960s. They still are the principal cause of the waiting list problems. However, the time taken to treat such patients has much more to do with the supply of the necessary specialists than public or private hospital funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This afternoon I also reminded the Senate that in my own State the private hospitals were very pleased to proceed. However, those private hospitals, the public system and the State Government were obstructed in that exercise by the specialists refusing to come to the party. Public patients on waiting lists in South Australia were held to ransom by greedy doctors and by greedy specialists. That is a fact. It is also one of the facts that ought to be part of this complex arrangement. Quite clearly, it is beyond the ability of my Opposition colleagues to deal honourably and honestly with the waiting list challenge in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked Minister Tate not too long ago a question about waiting lists and the allocation of public funding to public hospitals. This matter concerns the very graceless brawl that is going on between the New South Wales and Victorian governments and the Commonwealth over whether to sign the Medicare agreements. It is no more than political posturing. The Minister, in answer to a supplementary question, was able to deal with the quite clear question I put to him. He certainly made it clear to honourable senators opposite, who certainly were not minded to listen to him, that if we want to extend waiting lists then we reduce funding to public hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole Fightback package is devoted to shifting money from the public sector to the private sector in the hope that that will run down waiting lists. This is no way to deal with public funding of public hospitals. We certainly cannot reduce public waiting lists by reducing public funding to public hospitals. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the complexity of waiting lists must take into account the cost to the nation of health. I heard Senator Lees say in her contribution this afternoon that the real tragedy about health in this country is that, to a great extent, the political debate is not fought on the basis of preventive health, morbidity and disease, ways in which we can reduce ill health in our workplaces or in our community, and how we can look at clearly establishing environmental guidelines for clean water and unpolluted land, but on the basis of whether we have private or public insurance. This is a big distraction. But it is where the political fight has taken place. Unfortunately, with Fightback, this will continue to be the case. This is what will happen as the Opposition tries to drag us back to the 1950s and the Government proceeds apace with the equity, accessibility and affordability of Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, the Opposition has not put a cap on the cost to this nation under Fightback. One of the distinct achievements of the Labor Government in the health area has been holding the cost at about 8 per cent of GDP. The cost under the American system, which the Opposition is planning to adopt, is now about 13 per cent. It is growing out of control to such an extent that Mr Clinton has won an election on the second most important issue that the American people wanted to vote on&mdash;that is, to change their health system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Health care in America is unfair. It is outrageously expensive for individual citizens. Something like 100 million people in America have limited or no access to health insurance. The people of America have said, `That is enough. We cannot go on managing. We are sick, we cannot get to hospital and we cannot afford treatment. We cannot afford to meet our individual costs'. At last it has been recognised that the nation cannot afford those costs. In Australia we have actually managed to hold at a very reasonable and manageable 8 per cent the percentage of the money that the country is spending on health.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Newman, in a piece of high dudgeon this afternoon, suggested that this Government was evil and wicked and was into rationing. I am terribly pleased that Senator Newman can now spell that. I am pleased that she knows that this is occurring in the health area. Indeed it has. This is precisely why this Government has said that under the new Medicare agreements we will require and arrange for people to get into the public hospital system as public or private patients according to clinical needs. That is what this country will move to. It is what has been largely happening anyhow. Most people get into public hospitals as a result of accidents or emergencies. Anyone in this country who is ill as a result of an accident or an emergency is dealt with straight away in public hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply remind the Opposition about where Mr Packer went after he had had a massive heart attack and was at death's door. According to some descriptions, he went to one of the humbler public hospitals in Sydney. He went to a public hospital which treated him in the same way as every other patient. Public hospitals treat such patients regardless of their insurance status, capacity to pay, social status and socio-economic background. The public hospital system treats them according to need and it treats them equally. That is what our public system is about. It does not distinguish between patients in terms of their insurance status. Indeed, it is an absolute matter of principle that this Government says that we want to establish that as a right. We want to give a strong guarantee that people get into the public hospital system on the basis of clinical need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to appreciate that the waiting list figures are rubbery at best. We do not really know how many people in this country are on hospital waiting lists. I can assure Opposition senators that we have very little access to hard data from the private sector. The public sector properly goes some way to accounting in public for how it expends its money. It is clear from the Budget statements and the further development of Medicare that it is not good enough&mdash;I do not believe so and neither does this Government&mdash;that the States are not providing adequate data to the Commonwealth about how they are allocating their health dollars, particularly in regard to their hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is one of the new thrusts in this Budget for Medicare. We would like to require harder data so that we can make more reasonable decisions about access to services and what services we will properly put in place. I presume that honourable senators opposite would not argue if I suggested that a patient with gallstones had a larger claim on the public dollar than a person who wished to have their tattoos removed. We could then proceed to trawl through the various medical conditions or illnesses that people might front the hospital system with. Everybody would agree that there is some kind of rank ordering and that it is reasonable that a person who is in an acute state of illness be treated ahead of a person who has a chronic illness or an elective condition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We already set lists, if you like, allocating priorities within our system. We already know that we ration services. Would the Opposition argue that we should be expending as much effort to save the life of a person who is 85 and has kidney failure or cancer as we might with somebody who is 35 and has a young family? We can come up with any number of examples to justify making a choice between who has a priority claim on those spare, scarce and hard-won dollars. It is a nonsense for the Opposition to accuse the Government of rationing. What matters is that we begin to ration in a proper, thoughtful and deliberative way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was chairing the Senate Select Committee on Health Legislation and Health Insurance, that is why we actually went to an opening chapter that stressed the importance of asking for a large public debate so as to make the rationing of resources a matter of considerable community and ethical regard so that people would know, for example, how much it costs to keep a premature baby in a humidicrib alive&mdash;at last count, it was about $75,000. The community might have to decide how many humidicribs it wants. It might actually learn not to suck in its breath and gasp every time Derryn Hinch says, `Tiny, underweight baby flown across state'. I say to Mr Hinch, `Of course that is an entirely proper thing to do with restricted resources in order to save the life of a little person'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the sort of debate we cannot have about this whole issue because the members of the Opposition are ignorant and unprincipled in the sorts of debate they will try to lead on these emotional issues. They are like the Derryn Hinch of the Parliament: bleeding on any issue to make a cheap point and not seriously prepared to deliberate on the complexities of this issue, on the very important differences between the Government and the Opposition on Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am interested to note the silence from the Opposition when it is challenged by me on what Medicare levy it will include, should it win, with Fightback. Is it going to take the levy of 1.4 per cent which those opposite have come in here and abused us about for proposing to introduce in July next year? Is it going to take money or is it going to settle for 1.25 per cent? Like many areas of policy from those opposite, one can note the thunderous silence. I do not know if they even know. As I said this afternoon, they are in a log jam. They are keeping Medicare so that it is very difficult for them to go out and argue against it. They are keeping Medicare because they want the goodwill that goes with the name, the money that goes with the levy and the guarantee of universal insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what Medicare has given the people of Australia. That is what the people of Australia know, that is what they want and that is what they say every time they are asked in a news poll.

That is what their specious little motion this afternoon was about and that is why they have a terrible problem when they go out into the community to argue about health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under Fightback, health will cost every individual more, it will cost the nation more, it will be permanently inflationary and it will set the health policy of this nation back 30 to 40 years.

The problem that this Government has is that the decision of who gets into hospital is made by bureaucrats. Madam Acting Deputy President, you can frown all you like because you know that it is fact. The bureaucrats now have the responsibility to ration waiting lists; to decide what case is urgent and what case is not. That has been clearly demonstrated by files and files of cases that we have in our offices. If you do not get the complaints, Madam Acting Deputy President, we sure do. Senator Herron gave example after example this afternoon of where this is leading. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Crowley had the audacity tonight to say that the Opposition was ignorant and unprincipled. We have had our health policy on the table for 12 months and we are called ignorant and unprincipled, and yet this lousy, rotten Government will not even release its policy now&mdash;a matter of months out from an election. Senator Crowley comes in here, professing to know all about health, and she still cannot tell us what the policy is. I ask again: when will the policy be announced? The Government cannot say that what it is currently legislating for, and has legislated for in the past, is the policy because it is not working. The figures have blown out; they have gone to the extreme, and that is where we are at today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Waiting lists have grown. Anyone but anyone, if they are out there in the real world, which Senator Crowley quite clearly is not, can tell the Government that waiting lists have grown. People know that they cannot get into hospitals for various surgery, whether it be surgery as important as thoracic or cardiovascular surgery. Once again, Senator Herron gave examples this afternoon of how long the waiting list could be for an urgent cardiovascular operation. He said that an urgent case might get into hospital in a month. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But Senator Crowley is so rude in this chamber that she only breezes in, abuses, and then breezes out again. She would not stay here long enough to hear Senator Herron. She would not stay here long enough to understand that people are dying waiting for bypass surgery. The problem is that she does not care, and nor does this Government. If they cared, they would release the policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Crowley also asked, but she is not interested in sticking around to find out the answer: what are we doing about the Medicare levy? Our policy has quite clearly stated that we will retain the Medicare levy. But the Medicare levy, as far as we are concerned, is only a part of general taxation anyway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government is still pretending that the Medicare levy somehow funds the total cost of health. As I said this afternoon, the levy covers 17 per cent of the forecast total health cost. Senator Crowley would not know what I said this afternoon because she did not have the decency to come in and listen. She just comes in and abuses. She even thought that this afternoon we were debating a motion. We were not debating a motion this afternoon; we were debating a matter of public importance. It is absolutely outrageous to try to make anyone believe that the total cost of health is somehow being funded by this stupid levy. One could say to people, `Just take an extra 1.4 per cent of your income tax and you can categorise that as the levy', or just make it the whole issue and up income tax by 1.4 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, as I say, Senator Crowley has no wish or desire to know the truth. She treats this chamber and the Opposition with such absurd rudeness that one ceases to be amazed. One day she will have the courtesy to come in here and listen to a full debate and then respond to it accordingly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The old adage that empty vessels make the most sound has never been more eloquently established. With regard to the principal Bills that we are dealing with tonight, the committee stage will be held subsequently. There are a number of matters of detail raised by honourable senators that will most appropriately be dealt with there. So, as with the last set of Bills that we dealt with, I will not duplicate that exercise, although I will refer in passing to some.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do need to indicate formally&mdash;although the chamber is aware of it, because I think these amendments have all been circulated; they have certainly been provided&mdash;that there are some amendments to the Bills that will be dealt with in the committee stage. Before I deal with those, just as a matter of advice&mdash;although the chamber is aware of it&mdash;I should mention that in the area of corporate wardrobes there were amendments made in the House which I think have significantly enhanced that legislation. I will deal with that in a moment. There will be amendments with regard to the taxation of limited partnership companies to ensure that all limited partnerships are corporate limited partnerships in the 1995-96 year of income and subsequent years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be amendments relating to R&amp;D to allow for the gazettal of guidelines for determining when government bodies operate on a fully commercial basis and so will not be denied R&amp;D deductions even if some guarantees are offered. There will be an amendment to the royalty withholding tax clarifying that the tax will not apply to permanent establishments in Australia of non-residents of a country with which Australia has a double tax agreement. I can formally advise that the Government is considering representations that the transitional arrangements for companies whose R&amp;D proposals were approved after 30 March and before 10 June 1992 may adversely affect some companies. These representations are currently under consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, having put those formal matters behind me, there has been some broad support for the thrust of the major measures in this complex array of tax legislation, not so much that it makes complex legislation but that there is an array of measures in these Bills with which we are dealing that cover a large number of issues. That is caused by two things: it is a product of the cognate debate of several Bills at the same time and in the nature of taxation laws amendment Bills that they tend to range, of necessity, over a diversity of issues.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Broadly, there seems to be support for the register of environmental gifts. I was disappointed to hear it referred to as a political sop. It does not provide greater benefit; it only provides benefits in a much more regularised, organised way, capable of more effective scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was amused to find that everybody is claiming credit for the zone rebate initiative. Success has a thousand fathers or, in this instance, several parents, seeking to play different roles in the birth of this child. Nevertheless, it is recognised by the people of Australia, particularly by the people affected and by everybody in the chamber, that it is a worthwhile initiative to be enhancing the zone rebates. It has been welcomed here, as it has been welcomed around Australia and as it should be, as were the changes with regard to the prescribed payments system and dividend streaming. So given that support, there is no virtue in taking the time of the chamber in heated agreement. The second reading speeches outlined the changes and I welcome the support for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I always hesitate to say that my good friend Senator Panizza might in any way have misunderstood a piece of legislation because our offices are in the same corridor and every time I do he comes in and says, `No, I did not. I really understood it.' I did not hear what he said; I have only been able to get a report of what he said. He did seem to be concerned&mdash;far be it from me to say that he misunderstood&mdash;about what the Government was doing with TFN credits as they relate to provisional tax. I want to make clear&mdash;without going into it too technically&mdash;that what we are effectively doing is giving these credits the same status as other credits that taxpayers might have to set off against their provisional tax liability, for example, PAYE or others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provisional tax changes generally have been welcomed. Some people would always like to see bigger changes&mdash;the variation potential greater, the uplift factor lower&mdash;but I think it is generally regarded as putting these rates in a better perspective. I welcome the support for the capital gains simplification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to some of the issues in contention, first of all to the limited partnership question. It is never a welcome measure when legislation seeks to tighten up the operation of legislation where people have been seeking to use a particular form of structure which they regard as being tax-effective for them. But the Government is concerned that we should not allow to continue a process by which those not exposed to losses can utilise the tax benefit of those losses. It will continue to be the case that people exposed to genuine risk of loss in other forms of corporate vehicle will, if they incur the loss, have no diminution of their access to the tax benefit of that loss. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was reference in the debate to the international trends with regard to this matter. My advice is that comparable countries have in many instances felt the need to restrict access to losses through limited partnership, not necessarily in the way we have done, but recognising the same problem that we recognise and moving to resolve it. No-one expected it to be a popular measure, but I think it is a correct measure. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am a great friend of enhanced funding of infrastructure, but that is not to say that any tax proposal that will lead people to provide more funds to infrastructure is, of itself, justified. It depends on the nature of the tax measure, the likely cost and the likely implication, including its economic impact in terms of where it may divert investment that should otherwise be made elsewhere.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The occupational clothing proposals as amended in the House now have broad support. I note that Senator Watson raised a couple of questions of detail. I think they are better dealt with in the Committee, and I will happily respond to him at that time. I just acknowledge that he raised them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The R&amp;D changes are important. I think people generally recognise the virtue of the changes that have been made. With regard to questions of environmental expenditure, I understood people&mdash;at least Senator Kernot&mdash;to be raising concern that perhaps we should be even more generous. We have not here given a tax break to environmental expenditure. We have essentially recognised the contemporary responsibility of the corporate citizen&mdash;that an obligation of corporations in a modern society is to engage in such expenditure in the normal course of running their business, and that therefore that expenditure should be so recognised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My next point will be the last that I refer to before concluding. In summing up a second reading debate, there are always more points to raise than there is time in which to raise them, but others have sought to be brief in their contributions to expedite the proceedings, so I will seek to cooperate in the same way. There has been concern that residents of non-treaty countries with permanent establishments in Australia should not be treated differently from residents of treaty countries with permanent establishments. It is a complex issue. We could debate it for a long time. But the nature of the treaties is such that they protect Australia's position internationally and they protect the revenue. Residents of non-treaty countries may well not be residents of countries with comparable tax systems, and we know that in some instances they are not. If they are residents of a low tax country, there would be an incentive to enter into arrangements to enable them to pay most of their tax offshore, and that is not a loophole which we wish to leave. To the contrary, we would prefer that they were all being taxed under the withholding tax system, but we do not have that option, pursuant to our treaties, and that is proper, I think. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Concern has also been expressed about 30 per cent being too high a rate. The Government decided that Australia should impose withholding tax on all gross royalty payments to non-residents at a flat rate of 30 per cent in the absence of treaty limitations. The same rate applies to unfranked dividends paid to residents of non-treaty countries. By way of comparison, the non-treaty rates of royalty withholding tax of some of our trading partners are, for example: the United States, 30 per cent; the United Kingdom, Canada and Germany, 25 per cent; and Japan, 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I do not think we are out of step with others. As a matter of interest, though, I note that on 3 November in the debate in the House of Representatives, Mr Wilson, the member for Sturt, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . where we use withholding taxes we should set a much higher rate . . . Then we should reduce it . . . according to whether we are dealing with a treaty country or a country that has a tax system somewhat similar to our own . . . The lower rates of withholding tax should, therefore, be made available only when we are sure that we are getting a fair share of the tax cake.</PARA>
<PARA>I have not quoted every word of his speech. I do not wish to be accused of taking him out of context. I think I have got the sense of it accurately. I do not wish in any way to have anybody express concern because I did not use every word of his quote. I think if honourable senators read the full <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> text they will see that I have not taken him out of context. That is not to say that because one member of the House of Representatives from the Opposition generally shares my view rather than Senator Watson's that I am right and he is wrong. Nevertheless, it is an interesting addition to the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank honourable senators for their contribution to this debate. All but the Medicare legislation will now go to a committee. I hope that that legislation gets relatively speedy passage when it returns&mdash;and may we deal with the Medicare legislation in the committee stage somewhat more smoothly and harmoniously than we did at the second reading stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot give Senator Harradine a detailed answer to that. I understand that it is an important issue, but it is not an issue directly related to this Bill. This is a Bill, I accept, about raising the levy. It was never the intention of the Government that the levy would cover all the costs of the health system in Australia; nor have we ever pretended that it will. The expenditure side of Medicare is something that Senator Harradine will have to pursue with others, but, on the revenue side, this Bill merely proposes to raise the levy from 1.25 per cent to 1.4 per cent. So, as a matter of logic, it will cover the costs more than it otherwise would, but it is not designed to be a 100 per cent coverage.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I now go to the question of Australians who have been paying their way and are not eligible to receive Medicare benefits. I refer to the matter that was raised in this chamber by Senator Herron relating to a missionary couple in Papua New Guinea by the name of James and Ruth Mollenhauer. They had recently returned to Australia for the birth of their baby after doing three years missionary work in Papua New Guinea and their applications for new Medicare cards were refused by the HIC on the grounds that they were not Australian citizens. Because I am interested in this question as to whether the Medicare levy should be raised, I want to know why, if this levy is to be raised and if this levy is being paid, are people not entitled to Medicare benefits?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a more glaring example where the person was a freelance journalist, had been employed, had paid her taxes and had been overseas for a fairly short time. She is now back in Australia paying taxes and paying the Medicare levy, and will be giving birth to a baby in March. She has been denied a Medicare card. Frankly, this is appalling. She is an Australian citizen. She has worked as a journalist since 1983 and has paid her taxes. In 1990 she married and, with a Christian organisation, took part in voluntary aid projects in South East Asia. To help support herself and her husband, she undertook freelance journalism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She returned to Australia in July this year and subsequently was appointed to a temporary position of press officer. She has been duly paying taxation and the Medicare levy. Last month she went to the Medicare office in Canberra to apply for a new Medicare card in her married name. She explained that she had been out of the country and was informed that this would not affect her entitlement, as the time for which she had been absent was acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She returned to the office with the relevant information and was told that a new card had already been issued in her maiden name. She indicated that she wanted the card to be issued in her married name. After checking with the Medicare office in Sydney, the staff member told her that she no longer qualified because she had been out of the country. She explained her involvement in volunteer aid overseas. She also explained that she could possibly be going to China for similar volunteer aid for one or two years at the end of this year or next year. This has caused her great anxiety. She has been refused a Medicare card. Her baby is due in March and without Medicare coverage she will be faced with some financial hardship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I feel that this type of case is relevant to whether we in this chamber agree to an increase in the Medicare levy. If we agree to the increase in the Medicare levy and people, such as this person, who have been paying their taxes and their Medicare levy are not entitled to receive benefits, the system is unjust. I know it appears that the message has not got through to the Parliamentary Secretary who is at the table. I warned the Minister representing the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Senator Tate) that I would be raising these issues, but apparently the message has not got through; the communications have broken down. But this is an urgent case and I would be very grateful if the Parliamentary Secretary were to take this on board and, hopefully, pursue it so that justice can be done. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This legislation flows directly from the report of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Who is to guard the guards?</EMPHASIS> That report was an evaluation of the National Crime Authority. The primary matter considered by the Committee was the level of accountability of the National Crime Authority to the Intergovernmental Committee and, in particular, to the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decisions of the National Crime Authority are subject to review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act of 1977. They are subject to the most cursory scrutiny of the IGC and, to the extent that the Authority has thus far been prepared to interpret the relevant sections&mdash;55 and 51&mdash;subject to some sort of scrutiny by the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority. They are also subject to the Freedom of Information Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, presently that scrutiny is far from adequate. The Authority has argued that section 51(3) is the normal standard secrecy provision which refers to the disclosure by members of the Authority staff, members of the Authority and past members of the Authority, of certain information, including information to tribunals, courts and so on. The National Crime Authority has thus far interpreted that section to include, by way of disqualification from exemption, the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority. There has been very considerable debate on the relevance of that section by the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority. The Solicitor-General, if I remember correctly, originally gave an opinion buttressing the notion of the Authority members that they were bound by the secrecy provisions when they appeared before the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Clerk of the Senate, in a very eloquent and persuasive opinion, took the opposite view. By a process which one could politely describe as evolution, or perhaps more of attrition, we have found that the Solicitor-General, as a result of opinions he has given in respect of that and other matters, has come to the conclusion that his original opinion was wrong and that section 51(3) does not apply in the way in which it has been used by the Committee. However, having said that, the Opposition has an amendment which we propose to persevere with to ensure that in terms of debate that is beyond reach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are restrictions as to the information which can be given to the IGC and they are contained under section 59(5). However, I do not think that is any barrier to the IGC's scrutiny and monitoring of the National Crime Authority because, frankly, it just has not bothered. During the period of imbroglio, turmoil and confusion in the National Crime Authority, which for the first part of its life was the hallmark of its operation, the IGC without exception fastidiously ignored those difficulties. I think during the much more difficult periods, the IGC met but once and, to my knowledge, there was nothing on the agenda of that meeting which indicated that it was showing any concern for the difficulties that the National Crime Authority was having. The IGC, of course, is made up of the various State police Ministers&mdash;I think South Australia is the exception; that State has its Attorney-General on it&mdash;and also the Federal Attorney-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In view of the restrictions which the Joint Committee found itself suffering from, it has recommended changes to the method of accountability. The primary proposal was that the Joint Committee be given unfettered access to information with subsequent and sensible controls in terms of the disclosure of information of a sensitive nature which is given to the Joint Committee in camera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have always thought it somewhat obscene that a committee or a creature of the institution which set up the National Crime Authority is denied sensible and reasonable access to, and the opportunity of monitoring, the Authority's conduct. As we all know, one of the conditions of setting up the National Crime Authority in the first place was that it be subject to stringent accountability and supervision by the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority. As I say, thus far it has not been possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The task of the members of the Committee has not been much helped by the IGC's rather impertinent view that the Joint Committee ought to be abolished. Senator Tate is nodding. I assume he would not be nodding in approval but just acknowledging the absurdity and obscenity of that proposition. Clearly, the IGC has not done its job, and that has been eloquently demonstrated. To suggest that a committee of this Parliament is not responsible enough to receive from the NCA information as to its functioning, I find ludicrous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second option, and the fall-back position that the Committee took so as to give the Government two matters to contemplate, was that the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority receive information other than that which may be classified by definition as `sensitive'. This Bill opts for the second. I do not know, but I think it is more substantial than speculation to imagine that that is the preferred option of the IGC. The Federal Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) seems to very much reflect the view of the IGC. My experience of but two meetings of that body is that it has some fear of the Joint Committee exercising its functions properly and some concern that we might have the capacity to properly monitor it, and its view is that we ought not to be receiving information other than that which is `sensitive' as defined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the proposed Bill, if the chairman of the Authority declines to provide information, the matter can be referred to the Attorney-General who himself is capable of making a decision. But I never forget that he is a political animal and part of the political institution. He may refer the matter to the Inspector-General, a new position being created, who will investigate the matter and report back to the Attorney-General, and the Attorney-General may publish that finding in so far as it does not disclose the sensitive information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Joint Committee will be able to examine the annual report of the Inspector-General. That is not to say that it is intended to have a supervisory role or to second guess, but certainly to at least examine the annual report. The Inspector-General has some flexibility in terms of his responsibility. He is not required to investigate matters which he judges to be frivolous or vexatious. He will be required to notify the chairman of the NCA and the Attorney-General of any inquiries. The Inspector-General's hearings shall be conducted in private and he may compel the provision of documents and information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Complaints in respect of the NCA may be made through the IGC or the PJC and then on to the Inspector-General.

The chairman of the NCA will be required to advise the Inspector-General of his action in response to a finding of the Inspector-General. If the Inspector-General is dissatisfied with the resolution of the chairman of the NCA, he may report to the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are just one or two other minor amendments. One minor amendment includes the prohibiting of the disclosure of the serving of a process by the NCA which is issued under the recently amended sections 28 and 29. The current credit reporting provisions of the Privacy Act require the agencies to record any disclosures on an individual's credit information file and to ensure that an individual can obtain access to his or her file while, under the amendment to disclose, it will be prohibited until the notification of the prohibition expires. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has a number of amendments. The essence of our primary amendment is that the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority ought to have unfettered access to all information that it requires of the National Crime Authority. There then will be a mechanism to ensure that that information is disclosed only in a proper way. Perhaps what is not understood is that the disclosure of any sensitive information flowing to any committee by any member of that committee improperly will ultimately reflect on members of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It ought not to be overlooked that, as to the conduct of members of parliament in disclosing in camera evidence&mdash;as  at the present time in respect of almost all other committees, save for the ASIO committee&mdash;the real and final sanction is that of our peers and of the wider community. I believe that it is inherent in the position of members of parliament and incumbent on them to conduct themselves in a proper and responsible way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To suggest that members of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Crime Authority are sufficiently irresponsible to have a sanction placed on them as to what information they can receive, does a gross disservice to the functioning of the Parliament and to the Committee.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate today is debating the Government's National Crime Authority Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992. This Bill seeks to respond in large measure to some of the recommendations made by the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority in its report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Who is to guard the guards?</EMPHASIS> Unfortunately, I feel the response is not adequate and certainly not within the spirit of the recommendations made by that Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will address some of the major amendments made by the Government's Bill. I welcome the first amendment, which omits section 55(2) of the National Crime Authority Act. That section states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nothing in this Part authorizes the Committee&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">to investigate a matter relating to a relevant criminal activity; or</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">to reconsider the findings of the Authority in relation to a particular investigation.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a welcome amendment. During the existence of the Committee, which was established to assess&mdash;in a sense, supervise&mdash;the workings of the National Crime Authority, these provisions have caused difficulties. To say that the Committee may not investigate a matter relating to a relevant criminal activity raises considerable doubt as to whether the Committee may investigate anything. As to whether it should be prevented from reconsidering the findings of the Authority, similarly, this makes one wonder what task the Committee is left with, seeing it was asked to `monitor and review the performance by the Authority of its functions'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Who is to guard the guards?</EMPHASIS> various suggestions were made, one of which was to drop the words `matter relating to' so that the Committee was simply prevented from investigating criminal activity as such. That would have been acceptable. It was also suggested that findings should not be interpreted as being conclusive findings. However, the Government has gone one better and omitted the whole section. I certainly welcome that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unfortunate that the other provisions the Government has sought to put in place through this Bill virtually have the effect of preventing the Committee from exercising its function to supervise and monitor the work of the Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to some of those provisions. The central question is what information the Committee may obtain from the National Crime Authority. If we turn to the interpretation section of the Bill, we find that `sensitive information' is categorised as information which might prejudice:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the safety or reputation of a person; or</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the fair trial of a person who has been or may be charged with an offence; or</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the effectiveness of an investigation by the Authority; or</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the operations of law enforcement agencies.</PARA>
<PARA>These definitions largely mirror definitions which I offered in my private member's Bill that was seeking to solve this problem, but one wonders about the inclusion of the term `reputation'. If nothing may be said or disclosed which could conceivably prejudice the reputation of a person, it is far too wide and the first hurdle in the provision of information to the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second hurdle is in clause 9 where the Committee may request the chairperson of the NCA to disclose certain information, but only in the performance of its duties. At first glance, that seems quite reasonable. However, if the chairperson of the NCA decides that the request made by the Committee is outside the performance of its duties, the Committee has no recourse, avenue of appeal or reconsideration of that judgment. This places a barrier in the way of the Committee receiving information from the NCA which could in certain circumstances be insurmountable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third hurdle is that, if a dispute or a difference of opinion arises, the decision is ultimately to be made by the Minister. I find that totally unacceptable, because it does leave the decision of whether a parliamentary committee should have access to information which would enable it to exercise its duties in political hands. We have all had examples&mdash;I mention the former New South Wales Police Minister, Mr Pickering&mdash;where political considerations have intervened with proper processes in the area of crime detection, particularly in any large scale attempts to combat organised crime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I find the concept that the Government is putting forward of the Committee only receiving information that is not sensitive as defined in the Act totally unacceptable on the three grounds that I have foreshadowed: firstly, that the definition is somewhat faulty; secondly, that it is not possible to appeal if the chairperson decides that the information sought is not within the performance of the Committee's duties; and, thirdly, that the final arbiter is left in the political arena. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's intention in putting forward this legislation is well illustrated by the fact that absolutely no restriction is placed on disclosure of information received by the Committee once that information has been judged to be not sensitive. That to me seems to indicate that the Committee will receive only information that is generally available or can be made available to the public. It seems to me that that characterisation of the work of the Committee reduces its effectiveness considerably. It is quite clear that the work of the NCA deals in many areas with information that in normal circumstances would not and should not be made public, but withholding it from the Committee would make the work of the Committee absolutely impossible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear when we consider its duties, the Committee must have access to all information that is in the hands of the National Crime Authority. As I have mentioned before, the central task is to `monitor and to review the performance by the Authority of its functions'. It also has a duty to report to both Houses of Parliament; to examine each annual report; to examine trends and changes in criminal activities, practices and methods and report to both Houses of Parliament any change which the Committee thinks desirable to the functions, structure, powers and procedures of the Authority; and, finally, to inquire into any question in connection with its duties which is referred to it by either House of the Parliament, and to report to that House upon that question. It is quite beyond me how the Committee could fulfil those functions unless it had access to the information that the National Crime Authority has in its possession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the principle I have put forward in my private member's Bill&mdash;and I thank shadow Attorney-General, Mr Peter Costello, for his courteous acknowledgment&mdash;which principle is reflected in amendments by both the Opposition and the Democrats, is the correct one: the Committee must have unlimited access to all information within the purview of the ambit of activities of the NCA, except, of course, operational matters. In turn, members of the Committee and the Committee as a whole should be restricted in the disclosure they are able to make of the material that comes into their possession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments I will be moving will be putting that view forward and will advance provisions which will enable the National Crime Authority to advise the Committee that certain information may not be disclosed. If there is a difference of opinion, between either the Committee or a member of the Committee and the National Crime Authority, then that matter needs to be resolved by a judge of the Federal Court. I  emphasise again that in introducing a judge of the Federal Court as an arbiter at this point, I believe strongly that such a decision must be taken out of the political arena. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear that there may be many matters under investigation by the National Crime Authority which could, if made public, cause considerable embarrassment to the government of the day. It is beyond me how the Government can then expect, and in this case also the Opposition, that that particular decision can safely be left in the hands of the political representative of the Government, the Minister. I believe it is absolutely essential that this decision be taken out of the political arena. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I foreshadow another two amendments that I will be moving in this area. Those amendments address the question that, if certain material has been judged by the Federal Court judge as sensitive and therefore may not be disclosed either in the Parliament or generally in public, it may leave the Committee as a whole or members of the Committee in a difficult position if they feel they have come into possession of information which would suggest that certain remedial action needs to be taken related to the work of the National Crime Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To simply sweep it under the carpet by saying that it is sensitive information, that it may not be disclosed and therefore no effective political action may be taken, seems to me once again to defeat the task of the parliamentary committee. To cater for that, the amendments concerned suggest that that information may be provided by the Committee or an individual member of the Committee to the Minister, and to the Minister only. But to ensure that some political pressure is on the Minister to take responsible and responsive action, the Committee will report to the two Houses of Parliament that such a report has been made to the Minister&mdash;without, of course, disclosing its contents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another range of amendments, amendments 5 to 11, which I shall move, which address some of the provisions connected to the establishment of the new office of Inspector-General. In principle, I welcome the establishment of that office. It is one of the recommendations that was made by the Committee in its report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Who is to guard the guards</EMPHASIS>? The Committee has come to the conclusion that there are a lot of complaints which are made about the work or related to the work of the National Crime Authority which the Committee cannot cope with. It has neither the resources nor the expertise in many cases to deal with complaints, and yet very many of them are worthy of further examination and, if possible, resolution and remedial action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new office of Inspector-General is to be charged with that task. However, there are two areas which I believe require amendment. One of them is that, in a number of sections, the Bill provides that the Committee must hand on to the Inspector-General without any further involvement by the Committee any complaints it receives. I believe that that, once again, diminishes the potential for a substantive contribution that the Committee may make. I believe that it should be up to the Committee to determine how many of the complaints it receives should be passed on to the Inspector-General, and when.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, there are a number of sections which deal with the provision of reports by the Inspector-General. In many of these provisions, the Committee once again is conspicuous by its absence. Even where the complaint has been received by the Committee, the Committee has decided to hand it on to the Inspector-General and the Inspector-General has dealt with it, it is apparently considered by the Government that the Committee, in discharging its duties to supervise the National Crime Authority, should not be given a copy of the report at various stages of that process. That is ludicrous. Therefore, I have endeavoured to provide in a number of amendments the provision that when the Chairperson of the NCA and the Minister are given a copy of the report, the parliamentary Joint Committee also receives a copy of the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That raises a concern that where the Committee receives a report it could contain sensitive information. There is no provision at the moment in the amendments that are to be moved by the Opposition or by the Democrats which would cover that particular eventuality. I accept that the protection against disclosure of such sensitive information contained in a report must be in the Bill. Therefore, I will move an amendment to the amendments to be moved by the Opposition which will fill this gap. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This brings me to the conclusion of the overall assessment of the National Crime Authority Amendment Bill (No. 2). I express my disappointment that the Government has not seen fit to enable the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the National Crime Authority to carry out its work effectively and efficiently, but rather&mdash;I echo some of the words used by Senator Crichton-Browne&mdash;in spirit, if not in words, has followed the attitude expressed by the IGC that the Committee might just as well shut up shop. If the Bill were to be passed as the Government intended, the Committee might as well do so. With these comments, I recommend strongly to the Minister that he consider seriously the amendments put forward by the Australian Democrats and by the Opposition to enable the Committee to continue to carry out its work, which I believe is essential and valuable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight the Senate is discussing the National Crime Authority Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992. Primarily, the Bill attempts to deal with the continuing friction that has occurred between the parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority and the National Crime Authority on the one hand, and the National Crime Authority, the parliamentary Joint Committee and the Inter-Governmental Committee of Ministers on the other.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To start with, this indicates the complexity of the relationship between the various bodies which the Parliament first established. Naturally, the National Crime Authority, being the prime object of the original legislation, is an extraordinary body vested with powers of a quite different nature from those normally possessed by law enforcement agencies throughout Australia. More particularly, by way of obtaining references from various jurisdictions, it is able to overcome a lot of the hostility, jealousy and petty demarcations which allowed organised crime in Australia to get a hold, taking advantage as it did of the differences between jurisdictions and the lack of a body which could effectively investigate serious criminal offences occurring across the borders of the States and Territories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the National Crime Authority, the Inter-Governmental Committee on the National Crime Authority was established, as it had to be. It is natural in a democracy that, where a law enforcement body is vested with such extraordinary powers, there must be a body which takes political responsibility in the various parliaments for the operations and general conduct of that authority. Naturally, in our political system that is the elected members of the parliaments who attain the status of Ministers and who are responsible to the Parliament and, through the Parliament, to the electorate. The parliamentary Joint Committee also has an important role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one is discussing the question&mdash;which boils down to whether sensitive information ought to be passed from the National Crime Authority to bodies other than other law enforcement bodies&mdash;the history of the creation of the National Crime Authority and the various supervisory bodies argues very strongly that there should be no transfer of such sensitive information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us recall the definition of `sensitive information', which is provided for in the Bill and has universal agreement as a fair definition of what should count as sensitive information. Sensitive information means:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . any information the disclosure of which might prejudice:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) the safety or reputation of a person; or</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(d) the operations of law enforcement agencies.</PARA>
<PARA>A good starting point for deciding how such sensitive information ought to be dealt with is to look at the way in which the Act intended that such information should be dealt with by the Inter-Governmental Committee. This body of Ministers, who participated in setting up the Authority and sustaining it, in granting references to it and in taking responsibility for it in their own parliaments, is under a very considerable constraint. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 59(5) of the National Crime Authority Act provides that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Authority shall not furnish to the Inter-Governmental Committee any matter the disclosure of which to members of the public could prejudice the safety or reputation of persons or the operations of law enforcement agencies and, if the findings of the Authority in an investigation include any such matter, the Authority shall prepare a separate report in relation to the matter and furnish that report to the Commonwealth Minister or Minister of the Crown of the State by whom the relevant reference was made.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Intergovernmental Committee, as a body, is not to have access to that sort of information. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not speaking of improprieties on the part of Committee members.

In terms of distributing that sort of sensitive information into even more hands, irrespective of whatever precautions people take in their parliamentary or electorate offices with the handling of information and the safety of office procedures and so on, every dissemination of such material must have further attendant risks as to its disclosure. This is unfortunate for those whose reputation or safety might be unduly affected or where the operations of an investigation or a law enforcement operation might be jeopardised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, that is the adamant view of the Intergovernmental Committee. It needs to be emphasised because this Bill is not simply the attitude or the expression of a point of view of the Federal Government and the Federal Attorney-General; it is the point of view of all the governments of all the States and Territories of Australia in relation to this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Madam Acting Deputy President, I am sure that you would like me to indicate those who attended the meeting of the Intergovernmental Committee of the National Crime Authority last Friday in Melbourne. The meeting was chaired by the Hon. Michael Duffy. The Hon. Chris Sumner attended from South Australia; the Hon. Terry Griffiths from New South Wales; the Hon. Paul Braddy from Queensland; the Hon.

Marshall Perron from the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a wide range of political allegiances. In no way did they discuss this matter in any partisan manner, but they all agreed to a resolution, which was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Inter-Governmental Committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) supports the provisions of the Government's Bill which would prevent access by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority to sensitive information, and would ensure that disputes as to whether particular information is `sensitive' are resolvable by inquiry by the Inspector-General of the National Crime Authority and determination by the Minister, and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) opposes any amendment to the Bill which would have the effect of granting the parliamentary Joint Committee unfettered access to National Crime Authority sensitive information.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the resolution of the Intergovernmental Committee that was brought down last Friday, 20 November, in Melbourne after a full discussion of the matter and having had the pros and cons of the Opposition's amendments explained to it. That was its conclusion. It wanted to give encouragement and support to the Government persevering with its Bill which, it needs to be emphasised, has the following safeguards so that what occurs is not likely to result in a simple political act of bastardry by a Federal Attorney-General who was minded to frustrate the workings of the parliamentary Joint Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government proposes&mdash;as honourable senators will know&mdash;that if a chairperson of the National Crime Authority forms the view that the information which should otherwise be transferred to the parliamentary Joint Committee is sensitive, as described, the chairperson of the National Crime Authority does not make a final determination but the matter is referred to the Federal Attorney-General and he makes the determination. But, in doing so, the Bill indicates that he will seek the guidance of the Inspector-General of the National Crime Authority&mdash;an office created by this Bill&mdash;who will provide advice on the question of sensitivity. </PARA>

<PARA>In many respects the first amendment is a declaratory amendment. It clarifies the position which has been in some dispute between the National Crime Authority, the Attorney-General, the Solicitor-General and, on the side of the angels, the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority and the Clerk of the Senate. I might refer to the thirty-sixth report of the Senate Committee of Privileges. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More generally in relation to secrecy provisions, the exchanges of advice on this subject, referred to at paragraph 3.22&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which I will come to shortly&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">which were conducted between August 1990 and August 1991, are reproduced in the explanatory memorandum accompanying the Parliamentary Privileges Amendment (Effect of Other Laws) Bill 1991 introduced by Senator Crichton-Browne. The purpose of this bill is to declare, for the avoidance of doubt, that the powers, privileges and immunities of each House of Parliament, and of the members and committees of each House, are not affected by a provision of a law other than the Parliamentary Privileges Act except to the extent that the provision expressly provides that those powers, privileges and immunities are affected. Parliament should give urgent and serious priority to considering legislation of this kind.</PARA>
<PARA>In many respects, that is the effect of this amendment. It has been an absolute nonsense up until this point to argue differently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to refer to recommendation 5 of this same report, which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Parliament should give urgent and serious priority to considering legislation such as the Parliamentary Privileges Amendment (Effect of Other Laws) Bill 1991.</PARA>
<PARA>While I am on my feet I would like to read a further paragraph of the report. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The PJC itself, having grappled with the narrow interpretation of sections 51 and 55 of the National Crime Authority Act, has recommended that the situation be clarified, and Senators Crichton-Browne and Spindler&mdash;both members of the PJC&mdash;have separately introduced bills to amend the NCA Act in an effort to deal with the problem. The Committee also notes that the Government proposes to introduce legislation to clarify the relationship between the NCA and the PJC, based on recommendations of the Inter-Governmental Committee rather than those of the PJC. The Government has indicated, however, that it intends to formulate amendments to the Act "in a manner acceptable to the Government, the States and Territories, the Parliamentary Joint Committee, and the Parliament as a whole", to address the problem. The Committee of Privileges looks forward to the legislative resolution of the difficulties which have arisen.</PARA>
<PARA>I trust that these amendments now clarify that position. The Committee will now be in a position to receive all information, including information of a sensitive nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If these amendments were in place now the Committee would not be capable and competent to deal with the motion given to it by the Senate in respect of its present reference&mdash;that is, the reference relating to the relationship between the National Crime Authority and James McCartney Anderson. It would be in this position for a number of reasons, not to mention the definition of `reputation'. When one is dealing with personalities and characters such as James McCartney Anderson, Abraham Saffron and a number of other people, if this proposed Bill were in place there would be no flexibility and we would not be able to receive the sort of information that we are receiving now and, therefore, we would not be capable of in any way monitoring the National Crime Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems that we have had thus far is that until the last two chairmen, members of the Authority have refused to disclose what they describe as operational matters. I might give an example. A previous chairman of the Authority resigned in circumstances which led the Committee to make some tentative and superficial inquiries. The Committee simply wanted to know what were the circumstances surrounding the resignation of the Chairman of the National Crime Authority. We were told that we could not have access to that information because to do so would be to disclose whether or not it was an operation, and to do that would breach the secrecy provisions of the Act. That is the level of the nonsense that has been taking place with the National Crime Authority using the present provisions in a way that I am sure were never intended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer Senator Tate to the report of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Who is to Guard the Guards?</EMPHASIS>. If he reads the report carefully he will discover that the IGC's role was considered. It is not without significance to note that the Victorian Council for Civil Liberties commented that it saw the Committee, not the IGC or the Minister, as the body to which the Authority was accountable. The report stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Assistant Commissioner Graham Sinclair of the Victoria Police made a similar point:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the National Crime Authority needs to be seen to be accountable, and not just accountable to the IGC. In my view, the IGC is a body that has a greater vested interest in the National Crime Authority. I do not mean that disrespectfully. You are talking about relevant Ministers and so forth, some of whose staff are employed with the Authority from time to time. To me, this Committee stands much further away from any taint of vested interest in the Authority.</PARA>
<PARA>When we look at the way the IGC had conducted itself, we observed the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This claim by the IGC&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>when it says that it has a better line of responsibility&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is difficult to reconcile with the limited activities of the IGC. In the period July 1984 to October 1991, the IGC met on only 16 occasions.</PARA>
<PARA>The report went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, in 1989-90 financial year the IGC met only once. Yet during this period the Authority was embroiled in major controversies, including those relating to the operation of its Adelaide office and the abrupt resignation of its Chairman. The Committee is alarmed at the infrequent meetings of the body claiming to provide `effective oversight' over the Authority. More adequate supervision by the IGC would have prevented the controversies arising in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA>The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As indicated in chapter 3, the Authority's history has not been problem-free. The IGC appears to have done little if anything to address the problems. As far as the Committee can determine, the IGC made no contribution to giving the Authority strategic direction. Future Directions seems to have originated quite independently of the IGC. No management reviews have been initiated by the IGC. No formal assessments have been made by the IGC of the Authority's performance.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the contribution that the IGC has made. I remind the Minister, I hope without malice, that the police Ministers in the various States have their own problems in terms of managing the affairs of their own police departments. The history of the police department in Queensland is well known. The Commissioner of Police is now in gaol. The history of the New South Wales police force is well known and well documented. If the evidence being disclosed through ICAC is only partially true, it gives an indication of the incompetence of various police Ministers in managing and supervising their police forces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for the Western Australian police force, I need say no more than that the Commissioner of Police recently had the office of the Deputy Commissioner of Police bugged so as to monitor his conversations. That makes me wonder what capacity the various police Ministers have for the management of their own affairs, never mind their supervision of the NCA. It would be an absolute nonsense for the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority not to have access to all information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very interested to hear Senator Tate's vigorous defence of the IGC. I well remember&mdash;and I must go back to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> some time&mdash;his absolute outrage and indignation, when he was Chairman of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, that the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General had announced by press statement that amendments were going to be made to the National Companies and Securities Commission legislation. He promptly stood up and gave notice of an intention for a reference to the Legal and Constitutional Committee. Who did this lot think they were, telling the Federal Parliament what the legislation was going to be! At that stage, Senator Tate was on the side of the angels. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Tate is a Minister now. If that explains the difference, that explains the quantum leap in his logic. The truth is that the IGC is not the appropriate body to perform the supervision, the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority is. It is quite impossible for the Committee to function if the information provided to it is filtered to the point of definition, as is being offered in this legislation. As I say, to have `reputation' as a definition makes it almost impossible to deal with any reference. Yet the Government would have it that the Committee has some sort of capacity to monitor the National Crime Authority without information. I think that makes an absolute nonsense of the proposition. Therefore, we move these amendments requiring the National Crime Authority to provide the Committee with the relevant information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not repeat what I said before about the responsibility of members of parliament and their accountability, the consequences of misconduct and the inappropriate releasing of in camera evidence&mdash;or evidence of any nature. I say this to Senator Tate: the sanctions are the Parliament and the wider community. From a public point of view, it is not important what information is acquired by members of the Committee. What is material and of consequence is what it does with that information. There is no evidence that the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority has disclosed any information of a nature which would even embarrass witnesses&mdash;except for two members of the Authority who told lies to the Committee. For their sins, they were found out, as was disclosed in the Privileges Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Tate is serious about having proper supervision and monitoring&mdash;a proper watchdog&mdash;of the Authority, which he himself has observed has extraordinary and most unusual powers of the type that, a decade ago, would never have been thought to be given to any such body by the Parliament, then it has to be a body that understands how the Authority functions. The IGC does not do it. It is a nonsense to suggest that section 59, for instance, is complied with. The only way that the NCA can get its references is through the police Ministers. To obtain those references, it discloses very detailed and confidential information so as to be able to make sensible judgments. I ask Senator Tate to allow these amendments to prevail. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite evident from Senator Crichton-Browne's contribution that this arises from a series of incidents, perhaps the most dramatic episode being the inquiry which the parliamentary Committee wished to undertake into the resignation of Mr Faris as chairperson of the National Crime Authority. It seems to me that, in that situation, a legitimate question arose as to who should determine the sort of information that might flow to the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why we believe that this Bill&mdash;embodying, as it does, what is called, even by the parliamentary Committee, a second best but, nevertheless, acceptable provision for the Federal Minister responsible to this Parliament to determine whether information is sensitive or not on the advice of the Inspector-General&mdash;is a way to deal with this sort of situation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would not wish to labour this point past that which is necessary, but just for the record let me make it clear that these amendments do not spring from frustration arising from anything to do with Mr Faris and his resignation. I might add that when we were taking evidence for the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Who is to guard the guards?</EMPHASIS> I was very tempted to withdraw from receiving further evidence because it was a total waste of time trying to get sufficient sensible, intelligent, detailed information about the functioning of the National Crime Authority. It was almost impossible. In fact, the only evidence we got that was material, in my view, was evidence from people outside the National Crime Authority.

He was a protected witness&mdash;a very expensive one&mdash;and a primary witness in reference No. 1, which was inquiring into the activities of one Abraham Saffron.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this provision deals very adequately with the dangers that the Minister has outlined could be inherent in the Committee obtaining this information. It acknowledges that the Committee has a responsibility not to disclose outside its sphere of activity information that it has received. But as I have said before, it is important that the decision not be made within the political arena for political reasons. The examples where this has been done and where the matter has been treated as a political football are legion. I believe, therefore, that the provision for a judge of the Federal Court to make this decision is soundly based. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also ask the Committee to note that special provision is made in this amendment for an individual member of the Committee to be able to make such disclosures or to provide such reports. It is quite clear that, even within a committee, the tyranny of the majority may prevent a particular matter being brought forward which an individual member of the Committee believes is extremely important to be dealt with by Parliament or by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have referred previously&mdash;and I briefly repeat it&mdash;to the fact that there are also two provisions which would enable the Committee or individual members of the Committee, even if the judge has decided that the material is sensitive and may not be disclosed, to transmit this material to the Minister with a request that some remedial action be taken. I believe that satisfies the public policy requirement that sensitive material, once it is classified as such, could not or should not be simply buried but should be transmitted to the Minister properly in the political sphere to take appropriate remedial action. I commend this amendment to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In so far as there is a role for a Federal Court judge to deal with the question of further publication beyond the Committee, I think it would be of great interest to know the views of the Federal Court judges as to the imposition of this particular role upon them. Whilst it has some character of weighing up arguments as to whether information is properly described as sensitive or not, and therefore has some of the trappings of a judicial exercise&mdash;an exercise of judicial power&mdash;it really seems to be the sort of exercise which is properly, in our view, undertaken by a responsible Minister, such as the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth of Australia, who would be answerable to the Parliament and thence to the electorate for any determination to be made in relation to this matter. We believe it is more a matter for which a person ought to take political responsibility as a responsible Minister in an elected government than a decision to be made by a non-elected member of the Federal Court Bench. For those reasons, basically, we will oppose this amendment. </PARA>

I will not go on at length other than to quickly recap the processes proposed in that amendment. Firstly, there is the informing of the chairperson of the evidence or documents that are proposed to be disclosed under subsection 55(3). The chairperson may then, within 14 days, certify to the Committee that the information required is of a sensitive nature within the definition of subsection 55(4), and the Committee is then prevented from disclosing the evidence or documents except as permitted by subsections (10) or (12). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a member of the Committee so requests, the evidence or document must be referred to the Minister under proposed subsection 55(6). The Minister then has 14 days to determine whether the document or the evidence contains sensitive information. The Minister, before making that determination, may require the Inspector-General to make inquiries as to whether the information is sensitive. If the Minister determines that the information is not sensitive, it may be disclosed by the Committee in a report to the Parliament or a special report to the Parliament by a member of the Committee&mdash;that is, contemplating a minority report in most cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Committee considers that a matter relating to the NCA requires remedial action, it may make a report to the Minister which can include sensitive information.

<PARA>These amendments address the question of what happens to the reports of the Inspector-General, the office that is established by the National Crime Authority Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992. The amendments seek to address two matters. In a number of clauses of the Bill, it is provided that the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority must convey complaints directly to the Inspector-General. That includes complaints that the Committee has received from constituents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats feel that the Committee should be in a position to examine those complaints and, if it decides that it is beyond its capacity&mdash;and in most cases it will be&mdash;to examine those complaints and to deal with them exhaustively, then hand them on to the Inspector-General. When a constituent makes a complaint about the National Crime Authority to the parliamentary Committee, which has been charged with a duty by Parliament to supervise, examine and monitor the work of the Authority, then the Committee should not be simply placed in the position of being a letterbox and a `hander-on'. It must be enabled to exercise its discretion as to what needs to be done about the complaint. Amendment Nos 5, 6 and 7 address that matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The remainder of the amendments deal with the question of reports being submitted by the Inspector-General to the chairperson of the NCA&mdash;in some cases to the Minister. Almost pointedly, the parliamentary Committee is omitted from those bodies that receive copies of reports of the Inspector-General. My remaining amendments seek to remedy that. I believe it is essential, if the Committee is to continue to fulfil its functions, that it be given reports of complaints about the Authority, about the body that it has been charged to supervise, when the report is made by the office of the Inspector-General which has been established to deal with such complaints. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition supports the amendments. Senator Spindler has articulated with persuasion the fact that the amendments strengthen the role of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority. That is quite right. Save for this amendment, it may well have developed into a process where the Committee&mdash;to use Senator Spindler's expression&mdash;would become a letterbox, and there may be certain matters in the form of a complaint that the Committee may wish to deal with as a reference. This ensures that the Committee has a capacity to make judgments about how it deals with the various complaints.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason we support the proposition in the first place is that we are not competent by and large to deal with very many of the complaints that come before us. But there will be occasions where we may wish to look at the matter further. Senator Spindler is also right when he touches upon the starkly obvious point that the Joint Committee was left off the mailing list of the Inspector-General. In many ways, it reflects the rather vain and antagonistic view of the IGC towards the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do in part resent the attitude of the various State Ministers who make up the IGC with their arrogance and supercilious approach to our Committee. As I said at the beginning, it just shows what a nonsense their concern is for proper scrutiny when they have the audacity to argue that the Joint Committee ought to be abolished when, of course, the Committee is a body of this Parliament which created the National Crime Authority in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by reminding Senator Tate that the reason the IGC was formed was not only as a watching brief for the National Crime Authority but also as a form of placating the various antagonistic and parochial State Ministers who were concerned not to lose any of their powers.

Senator Harradine's amendment, we think, achieved a couple of things. In fact, what it did achieve was significant and very useful for the Parliament. It achieved having codes of standard which are usually self-regulatory and do not come normally before the Parliament. That will remain, as I understand, in the Government's amendments.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problems with Senator Harradine's amendment go far beyond pay television; they go to the heart of proper democratic process. The reason I make that comment is that Senator Bourne said that Senator Harradine's amendment had the virtue, the value, of forcing the Houses to deal with an issue. The difficulty is that not only does it not do anything of the sort but it also has the horrendous implication that law will be made by both Houses literally doing nothing at all. Simply by Senator Harradine or any other senator in the Senate or indeed&mdash;and perhaps even Senator Harradine should consider this&mdash;a member of the House of Representatives giving a notice of motion will law be made, because neither House does anything else. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I said last night that it was unprecedented. Mr Smith, the shadow Minister, sought his own independent advice from the parliamentary research service.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope the Committee understands that we are not talking here about disallowing regulations. Senator Harradine's amendment has changed that. The original section 128&mdash;and this is why I would like to return to that, but in sweet reasonableness to Senator Harradine we are not doing that&mdash;made these codes of practice disallowable instruments subjected to the normal procedures of this Parliament. Senator Harradine's amendment removes the original section 128 and replaces it with a power to make law; to actually draft these codes of practice here in the Senate or in the House of Representatives and make them law. This is the problem. Part (2) of Senator Harradine's amendment states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If notice of a motion for an amendment to a standard or code of practice is given in a House&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>a House; either House&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and within 15 sitting days of that House after the notice has been given:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) the notice has not been withdrawn&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and, of course, the notice would not be withdrawn&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and the motion has not been called on . . .</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, nothing has happened. Part (2) continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the amendment specified in the motion shall then be taken to have been agreed to by that House. </PARA>
<PARA>It passes the Senate without a single word of debate. The problem then is that it goes to the House of Representatives, or the other way around. Part (3) of the amendment states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If a House agrees to an amendment&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and we have agreed to it by doing nothing under part (2), because nothing has happened; all that has happened is that the Senate has a notice of motion&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in accordance with subsection (1), or is taken to have agreed to an amendment pursuant to subsection (2) . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, it is simply deemed to have been agreed because nothing has happened&mdash;no debate; nothing. If 15 sitting days go by in the other House and nothing happens, the amendment is taken to have been agreed to. I said last night that this was an horrendous amendment and I was taken to task for describing it as such. It is, and the horror of it has nothing to do with pay TV or anything else. This is law of a breathtaking kind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the scenario under the Harradine amendment. If Senator Harradine or anyone else comes into this House, and it can be done on a daily basis, jumps to his feet at 10 o'clock in the morning with a cast of thousands present, as we have every morning in here, and gives a notice of motion that says, `I move that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Neighbours</EMPHASIS> shall be banned from television'&mdash;it is on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> under this amendment and nothing else may happen for 15 sitting days&mdash;if there is no debate, no motion actually moved, under Senator Harradine's amendment, it becomes deemed to have passed the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It then goes to the House of Representatives and under the next part of the amendment, part (3), if nothing happens in the House of Representatives, it becomes law of Australia. Vigilance would be required. This is an horrendous amendment. I said this last night and it is accurately described. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the soft words of Senator Harradine saying that people will only come in once a year or just at the end of the year as a clean-up exercise, I draw the attention of the  Committee again to the amendment. There is nothing to stop a senator, or indeed a member, coming into the House every single sitting day of the Parliament and giving notice of motion to amend this, that or something else that is a code of practice. In fact, by amendment they can totally rewrite it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, we are not disallowing regulations; we are making law in this amendment. After notice of motion is given in the Senate or in the House of Representatives, by the simple fact that nothing else happens after 15 sitting days have elapsed in both Houses, it becomes law. How can anybody reasonably describe that as being democratic?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last thing I wanted was to have this Bill amended at all in the House of Representatives. We were prepared to make great concessions in terms of what was amended in this Bill. The last thing I wanted was for this to have to come back to this chamber. I am sick of it; everybody is sick of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The implications for democracy and the democratic process are so profound in this amendment that it simply cannot be allowed to happen. We will not allow it to happen. We will not proceed with this legislation if this is carried. We cannot allow that to happen. I ask honourable senators to read Senator Harradine's amendment again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say honestly: how can the Australian Democrats with their philosophy of democratic government support this? How could they support any proposition which says that, by simply giving notice of motion&mdash;we do it 20 times every morning in here&mdash;it becomes the law of Australia without another word of debate by virtue of the fact that nothing else happens? That is an extraordinary proposition for the Committee to carry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I really do plead with the Committee to consider the implications of parts (2) and (3) of the amendment. Technically, this does not even have to go to the other House. If that House does not get notice of it, it has to be put on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper </EMPHASIS> by a member of the other place. It is a profoundly undemocratic amendment. We cannot allow a member or senator in this Parliament to stand in his or her place and give a notice of motion which then, by simple virtue of the fact that nothing else happens, becomes a law of Australia. That is the effect of Senator Harradine's amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I apologise to the Committee for going on at some length about this, as I did last night. I have not used the word `fundamental' once, but I do want to get across to the Committee the real horror of the total destruction of the democratic process which is wrought by this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accept Senator Bourne at her word. I know her well enough to know that. She has said that this amendment has to be supported because it forces the Parliament to take some action. The Government amendment does that, and that is why we have amended the Bill. The profound problem with Senator Harradine's amendment is that it does exactly the reverse: it removes the obligation from either House to do anything. By the simple fact that nothing is done, a law is made by one member of this Parliament in either House simply giving notice of motion that a law be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like any honourable senator to deny that this is true, but, as I said last night, even though Senator Walters may not be with us after the next election, I predict now that these notices of motion will be given in the Senate on a regular basis. The only way that we can stop this from becoming law is by absolute vigilance and by depending on every occasion on nothing slipping through with all of the horrendous amount of business that these Houses carry. If we are not absolutely vigilant and do not scrupulously examine the notices of motion given every day either here or in the House of Representatives, and the 15 days elapses in both Houses with nothing else happening, this Parliament will have made a law which has profound implications for the broadcasting industry and the people who watch television in this country without a single word of debate having occurred in either House of Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister makes the point about regulations not being law. They are law, all right. We then get to the situation where, if a regulation is made, a law is made by the bureaucracy and that is tabled in this Parliament. By virtue of the Senate doing nothing about it, it retains its legal status. Is that the total destruction of the democratic process? Of course it is not. That is precisely what I have suggested in this amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We come then to the question of whether or not, just by an individual member of the Senate getting up here and moving an amendment to a code of practice or a standard, that code of practice or standard will have been amended. Senator Collins is suggesting that people may not know that there has been an amendment moved and, therefore, it may slip past. What is the bureaucracy doing? There are armies of people within the bureaucracy looking at the notices of motion and what goes into this particular chamber and of course they will know what has been passed here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister and the Government are striking at the heart of the democratic process. The Minister and the Government clearly do not want the Parliament to deal with a matter which might be of great public importance. A matter which indeed is of great public importance at the present moment is violence on television. It is an area of extreme public importance. The Minister does not want the Parliament to have the ability to deal with that matter. He does not want it at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Minister says is false. He says that my amendment will prevent the television industry from consulting with the community. That is false and the Minister knows it is false because the industry is required, under the Broadcasting Services Act, to undertake those consultations. The Minister knows that so why did he say it? Is he suggesting that the television industry is going to breach the law simply because of this amendment? Is he suggesting that the Australian Broadcasting Authority&mdash;Brian Johns&mdash;is going to break the law just because of this amendment? Is he implying that? Is he saying that? That is what he has just said. I have more respect for both the industry and Mr Johns than to agree with that suggestion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to the suggestion the Minister has made about Warwick Smith's advice. The first part of Warwick Smith's advice from the Legislative Research Service is irrelevant because the Government is agreeing to the Parliament doing something on codes of practice and program standards. The Minister points to the last part of the advice which reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed new section 128 follows a similar method, but there are significant differences. Firstly, the period in which regulations can be disallowed under the Acts Interpretation Act is limited to a short period after they are made. The proposed new section 128 does not provide for the standards or codes to be laid before the Houses shortly after they are made, and a motion for amendment can be made at any time.</PARA>
<PARA>One of the very valid reasons for not having them laid before the Parliament automatically is the very reason that I advanced when I proposed this amendment; that is, I do not envisage, nor do I expect in the amendment, that automatically these matters should come before the Parliament as do regulations. I do not envisage that at all, and that was quite a deliberate instruction of mine. The final paragraph says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, disallowance is a negative act, and it is reasonable for a disallowance to take place unless there is positive support for the regulation expressed by the House. An amendment is a positive act, which makes a positive change, and it is arguable that amendments should only be made upon a positive vote of the House.</PARA>

We are not talking about disallowing regulations with Senator Harradine's amendment&mdash;not even Senator Harradine pretends that&mdash;we are talking about making law. Senator Harradine wanted me to address this point and he is not listening. The difference between Acts of parliament and regulations is that the whole disallowance procedure is a method of scrutiny which works very effectively and which is administered by a committee of this Senate that has no peer, that is, the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. But the disallowance act is a negative act. It is a means of scrutinising the Executive's delegated powers.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking about passing law with this amendment, not the negative act. Acts of parliament are called Acts of parliament because they take a positive act of the Parliament to create them.

The disallowance procedure is an effective scrutiny of Executive delegated decision making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might add&mdash;and I do not make much secret about where my sympathies lie on this&mdash;that the question of our making too much delegated regulation and subordinate legislation is a separate debate.

We do it every day in second reading amendments in this chamber. We delete all the words and replace them. That is exactly what one can do, and Senator Alston knows that. For example, Senator Harradine's notice of motion could be that he will move that code of practice number so and so be amended to remove&mdash;let us take a realistic one&mdash;the prohibition on R being broadcast on free to air and replaced with a prohibition on R and M.

We should turn the situation on its head and imagine what would happen if someone wanted to play ducks and drakes with this in the House of Representatives and it got through. Senator Harradine might not like that very much if the Government in the House of Representatives was not of his persuasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But let us stick with the Senate under Senator Harradine's amendment. Senator Alston has conceded that this scenario could reasonably happen. A code of practice comes in which says that R is banned from free to air. Senator Harradine comes in and gives notice of motion to the effect that he is amending that to ban M, as well as R, from free to air. Nothing happens in the Senate for 15 days under his amendment&mdash;not a word of debate. The motion is not brought on and it becomes deemed to have passed the Senate with no debate. It then goes to the House of Representatives as a message. Unless somebody actively puts it on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> in the House of Representatives, it does not even have to go on that House's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>. After 15 sitting days of its being received as a message by the House of Representatives, without even going on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>, it becomes a law of Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to go on at length about this.

To put up a proposition that we can make law for Australia with not a single word of debate having been uttered other than the notice of motion being given by one senator or member of the House of Representatives is a nonsensical proposition that nobody interested in democracy should support. </PARA>

It seems absurd, that with one hand a House should be given the right to disallow a regulation, and with the other hand the Government should be given power to overcome that by keeping the motion at the bottom of the notice-paper. The effect of the amendment is that, unless the motion is debated and decided within fifteen days of its appearance on the notice-paper, the regulation being challenged shall automatically lapse.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All of this puts this whole process in a very difficult position. As I said before&mdash;and I would like to go through this process&mdash;the Government amendment that is before the Committee tonight was drawn up in consultation with the shadow Minister for communications, the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith). This amendment did not just spring out of left field; we have not dragged this off the top of our heads in the last half-hour. We saw the problems with creating law by negative action rather than positive action. I discussed it last night. We have been discussing this matter for most of the afternoon, on and off, and this evening with the shadow Minister. It is in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of the House of Representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow Minister advised me that the Government amendment was satisfactory and that it solved the problem. In fact, the honourable member for Bass enunciated, when he tabled his legal advice&mdash;the final paragraph of which says,`Yes, this is a positive action and it should only happen by positive action'&mdash;that he supported the Government amendments in the House of Representatives. I point out the difficulties that we are now facing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Harradine would let me finish, I can say it myself. It is in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. Obviously Senator Harradine only saw the first part of what he said. The honourable member for Bass made two statements on this amendment. Senator Harradine should go and have a look at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> proofs. When he concluded the debate in the House of Representatives, the honourable member for Bass stated the reasons why he supported the Government's amendment. He then said&mdash;and it was curious wording, I confess&mdash;that nobody knew what would happen in the Senate, but that he hoped that his support for the amendment in the House of Representatives would provide some guidance, presumably to his colleagues in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know the reason why he said that, and it had nothing to do with any deficiencies in the Government's amendment; it had to do with what I have been witnessing going on on the other side of the chamber for the last hour. I stated this at the beginning of the debate: the fact is that if the Government wanted to adopt a position, we would want to go back to the original section 128 which made all of these standards and codes disallowable instruments&mdash;in other words, subject to full parliamentary review like delegated legislation, and disallowable by the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We knew that was not acceptable to the Senate; that is why we negotiated this with Warwick Smith. We did not do that, even though we knew we could not support this amendment, and the honourable member for Bass indicated that, too. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps I may make our position clear. What we have tended to lose sight of in this debate this evening is that when we supported Senator Harradine's amendment the other night, we made a very significant move in the direction of parliamentary democracy; over the Government's dead body, but nonetheless we did it. What we succeeded in doing&mdash;and I think Senator Bourne said this at an earlier stage&mdash;was to allow the Parliament to have a say as to the amendment of standards and codes of practice. But it was also abundantly clear, from what Senator Harradine said, that he would not expect any amendment to take place without a positive vote of both Houses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In those circumstances it seems anomalous that one can have a double default mechanism that would allow a change to be brought about without any positive vote. It seems to me that when one analyses the differing points of concern that have been expressed tonight, it really comes down to whether, in the normal circumstance, if the Senate is the place where notice of motion is most likely to be given, the House of Representatives, in due course, ought to be forced to conduct a debate. I have no doubt that Senator Walters will want to contribute to the debate on this point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that, if the House of Representatives is minded to support the amendment, it will bring the matter on for debate. By choosing not to do that, the House of Representatives&mdash;or the majority party&mdash;is making it plain that it will not be supporting the amendment. In those circumstances, Senator Harradine's conditions have not been fulfilled and he would not expect them to be fulfilled. In other words, he does not expect that an amendment ought to be achieved by the vote of one House only; it has to be by vote of both Houses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Knowing that that is the position in the House of Representatives, what the original amendment did was to force that debate to occur, even though, for practical purposes, there was a pre-determined outcome. One would know, because one would see from the vote here how each party lined up on the issue, what was going to happen in the House of Representatives. Of course, the majority party, if it chose not to bring it on, would make it abundantly clear that it was not minded to support it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me to simply come down to whether we ought to allow those default mechanisms to occur. I have a great deal of sympathy for Senator Harradine and that is why we supported the amendment in the first instance and I think we have achieved an overwhelming result. We have achieved a situation where, by vote of both Houses of parliament, the ABA can be overridden. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Harradine should not be churlish about this. He should not think that somehow the Opposition has suddenly ratted on a deal or that we do not really have any sympathy. The fact is that we have overwhelmingly supported a proposition that turns what the Government wants to do on its head. The Government has not been at all keen on it. We have seen the merits in this from the outset, as have the Democrats. We still adhere to the view that if the Parliament, meaning both Houses, wants to change those standards or codes or practice, it ought to be able to do it. That is Senator Harradine's view. So it simply comes down to the issue of whether we ought to be allowing things to happen simply by default. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that that would then involve a great degree of vigilance. It is possible that things could slip through. It does not have to be a fundamental amendment, which, of course, would attract national attention and then ensure that everyone was very anxious to move the necessary amendments or to bring the motion on for debate; one could actually have something that looked innocuous but was not picked up. We had an instance of that not so long ago with the superannuation guarantee charge legislation where, because the debate was still proceeding well after midnight, something slipped through, the records were not accurate and the House of Representatives found itself voting on something which had not occurred in this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot pretend that somehow the system is infallible. Therefore, if we are to amend standards and codes of practice, we ought to do so consciously, deliberately and on the basis of a notice of motion given in each House. If we reach that position, then we have achieved what Senator Harradine's amendment would appear to be arguing for; that is, that this Parliament, by separate majority vote in each chamber, ought to be able to override the ABA. That is what we have supported, and we still support it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are saying tonight is that it does not seem right that one could bring about that result by default. Therefore, I do not see that we have in any way stepped back from our commitment to what I think is a very worthwhile and progressive amendment and one which will enable notices of motion not only to be given but to be brought on for debate&mdash;for votes to be taken and for people to have to show their hand. If there is sufficient community support for it to be brought on in the other place, then that will occur as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the matter is taken to a vote and the view is the same, then we will have achieved what we set out to achieve. In those circumstances, I think what we are looking at tonight is not any sort of fundamental change to what was originally proposed, but simply a refinement to ensure that we require a positive vote in both the chambers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Apropos of what Senator Harradine said before, I agree with what Senator Alston has said. He shows his great legal ability in this case. Mr Chairman, it is a constitutional point. If we are to pass legislation in this House it has to be passed in accordance with the Constitution. That does require, as Senator Alston says, a positive vote in both Houses. A system which attempts to get legislation through by default is not in accordance with the Constitution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Harradine said, `The legislation, as originally made, is subordinate legislation, and surely we can alter that'. As Senator Alston said, `Of course we can, but in altering it we have to go through a process that is set out in the Constitution and that requires a positive vote in both Houses'. The default mechanism, as Senator Collins has said and Senator Alston has inferred, is a system that is not available to us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will just deal with the matter raised by Senator Alston. I would be grateful if he would consider carefully my response to him. I ask him to give me the courtesy of listening to my response to what he said. I acknowledge Senator Alston's sincerity in this matter. What he actually indicated was that we should not have a situation whereby legislation is virtually passed by double default. He indicated to the chamber that if a motion to amend a standard or code of practice was adopted by one chamber&mdash;that is to say, by a vote of this chamber&mdash;and then that message was sent to the House of Representatives and the government of the day did not bring that matter on for debate in the other chamber, that would be an indication that the Government was not supporting the amendment to the code of practice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not necessarily the case. There has been a situation in regard to regulations where the 15 sitting days has been allowed to expire by the Government because it did not want the regulation. So the main point that Senator Alston has made out against my proposition does not really hold water. I refer to the Blewett instance, which is a classic example. He just allowed the 15 sitting days to expire and blew the regulation. He did not want to get up and debate it; he just knocked it off by that means. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is the point that I am making. It does not indicate that he does not support the motion to disallow. In fact, in that particular instance he actually supported the motion to disallow but chose to let the 15 sitting days run and, in effect, supported by a negative action the disallowance of that motion. So what is the difference between that and this?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of this nonsense that Senator Collins has been talking about that somehow these measures can be snuck through is a load of tripe. I have never heard so much tripe in my life. As I said to him, people have to be asleep for six months before suddenly they realise that M cannot be shown on television. That is a nonsense because if, for example, a period of 15 sitting days has expired in this chamber, a message has to go back to the other chamber. As I am advised, that message also goes to the Department. What would the Department do at that stage?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what the Minister has been on about is just ludicrous. It is crazy. It is a furphy. It is the use of hyperbole to deny, effectively, to this chamber and to the House of Representatives&mdash;the elected representatives of the people&mdash;the right to deal with questions of great public moment. I have been accused of proposing a motion which represents the total destruction of the democratic process. I am doing the reverse. What I am doing is trying to ensure that the Parliament deals with these questions of great public moment&mdash;not in an automatic way as per regulations, but only in a manner that will ultimately have the support of both Houses of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, let us say that everybody is asleep for six months, including the Department. What will happen the day after people realise that there has been a change in the code of practice? The government of the day would get up the next day and move that it be reversed, and that takes four days before the matter is actually determined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Opposition that my amendment is intended to ensure that the Government cannot just put it on the bottom of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>; it has to deal with it. I refer to what was said on 2 December 1936 when this particular measure was decided upon in respect of regulations. Mr Blackburn, who moved the amendment, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effect of my amendment will be, that a member gives notice of a motion to disallow a regulation, that motion is either disposed of by the House in which it is moved, within fifteen sitting days, or the regulation ceases to operate. In this House or in any House in which the Government has complete control over the time-table, the Government can render illusory the rights of the House to amend regulations simply by postponing a motion for disallowance.</PARA>
<PARA>Do honourable senators follow that? What did Sir Robert Menzies say? He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I am indebted to the honourable member for having drawn my attention to this point. It seems absurd, that with one hand a House should be given</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the right to disallow a regulation, and with the other hand the Government should be given power to overcome that by keeping the motion at the bottom of the notice-paper.</PARA>
<PARA>That is precisely what the Government is doing in these amendments. It says that it is providing to the Parliament the power to amend codes of practice and standards. It is providing that, but what it is doing is making illusory the rights of the Parliament by amending my amendment so that it can, simply by postponing the motion for disallowance, make that provision illusory. As Sir Robert Menzies said, that is absurd. It is absurd to give the right to disallow a regulation&mdash;and in this case a code of practice or a standard&mdash;with one hand and, with the other hand, give the Government the power to overcome that by keeping the motion at the bottom of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>

I concur with everything that was just said by Senator Alston. It might be useful for people to know what the drafting instructions were that I gave for this amendment. I am very keen to see this legislation, in whatever form, finally get through this Parliament.

That is the reason for the drafting instructions I gave.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the double default, as Senator Alston referred to it, was pointed out to me last night, I said to the draftsman, `We are not going to get the support of the Senate for the original position that the Government adopted.

So if we want to get this through the Senate we are going to have to maintain that structure'. Senator Harradine has had a win out of this. That is why I cannot understand Senator Harradine's attitude. He has had a win, and I am happy to acknowledge it. I said to the draftsman, `Give me an amendment that maintains the structure for which Senator Harradine got the support of the Senate but which requires the positive action of both Houses of Parliament to achieve it instead of a double default by both Houses of Parliament'.

I hate to tell Senator Harradine this, but an amendment that becomes law is an Act of parliament, as I explained before, because it is a positive act of the Parliament to create it. Delegated legislation, rightly, as Senator Harradine said, is made by bureaucrats, not by parliament, and is subject to disallowance by parliament. It is a negative action. It is a scrutiny on the Executive power to achieve. Senator Harradine is talking about the positive action of amending something that then becomes law. I point out that his amendment does not cover only codes of practice; it also covers standards. It covers things such as Australian content and children standards.</PARA></TALK.START>

The structure that he has asked for, in which the Parliament is positively involved in amending standards and codes of practice of the ABA, has been retained. But it has been retained, as Senator Alston said correctly, by amending the proposal so that that act is a positive act and not a double default. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I pay tribute to a great Queenslander, and indeed a great Australian, the late Sir Leslie Thiess, who died in Brisbane on Wednesday night. My early memories of Sir Leslie are of when he was working on main roads projects and I was working for the Main Roads Department typing estimates in the drafting section, many of which were jobs carried out by Thiess Bros during the war years. Over the years that I have been living at Kingaroy, I have gone up and down the roads from Brisbane to Kingaroy by car so many times that I have lost count. Joh has told me of all the cuttings on that road that were built by Thiess Bros and also of the many sections of bitumen that were laid by Sir Leslie's firm. During those war years Thiess Bros also ended up building dams, airstrips and ports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1958, 25 per cent of the Snowy Mountains hydro-electric work was constructed by Thiess Bros. Thiess Holdings became the first Australian company to win a contract for tunnelling works in competition with international construction companies. Is it any wonder that I say he was a great Australian?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area of his work was the pioneering of the open-cut coalmining in central Queensland in the 1950s. He went to Japan and organised the first sales of coal to Japan from the Kianga open-cut mine. Look at how that industry has grown and what it has meant to the economy of Queensland. I was in Gladstone on Monday this week, and the vast expansion of open-cut mining is obvious from the tremendous stockpile of coal at the port ready for transport to Japan, and no doubt also these days to Korea and other South East Asian countries. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is obvious that he was a great Queenslander who did much for the economy of our State. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It grieves me very much when I read in the media of the $1m bribe he was supposed to have given to Joh. That was all based on a story told to Channel 9 by Mr Woodham, who had been sacked by the Thiess family for dishonest practices. He was paid $50,000 for the story, which was untrue and was meant to hurt Sir Leslie. He threw in Joh for good measure, to make a good story and to get his $50,000.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that, after thorough investigation, the CJC wrote to Joh's solicitors and told them that there was nothing on which to base any legal action. It examined that before the case went to court. After Sir Leslie defended it and it had been finalised, the CJC carried out some months of investigation based on what was said in the court and came to the same conclusion that there was absolutely nothing on which to base any charges. Woodham and Channel 9 did not even come to Sir Leslie and Joh and ask their side of the story because, they said, it would have spoilt a good yarn. In other words, they knew it was a trumped-up story to build up the ratings of Channel 9. There is no doubt that it was completely untrue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Queensland Government, when Joh was Premier, awarded contracts on the basis of the lowest conforming tender. Indeed, in all contracts let in his almost 20 years as Premier, they did not find any based on other than the lowest conforming tender. Any work given to Thiess Bros was won by it on merit. The stories Channel 9 came up with in this regard were completely without credence. When we think of what this wonderful Australian has done for the nation, there is a dark, black cloud lying over the Channel 9 people who were involved in that exercise: Jana Wendt, Peter Wilkinson, and, of course, Ron Woodham, the man who told them the snake yarn in the first place. It was one of the most despicable actions that could possibly have been taken against a man like Sir Leslie Thiess.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am happy to stand in the Senate tonight and pay a sincere tribute to Sir Leslie Thiess, a great Queenslander and a great Australian, who, as Joh said in the paper yesterday, had contributed more to the State of Queensland's growth and development than anyone he has known. I would also like to express to his family my sincere sympathy in the loss of their father, brother and friend. </PARA>

In fact, he had a farm, I believe, just outside Toowoomba. He grew up on that farm with his family and then diverted into industry and commerce. He provided a great many jobs and he is one of the men who changed the face of Queensland and brought it from a small State that was basically primary industry to a State that went in and built up great mining and engineering works. Sir Leslie Thiess played his role in Queensland, and I add my sympathies to those of Lady Bjelke-Petersen to his remaining family and pass on my condolences. </PARA>

He was an extraordinarily strong individual. He came from a large family, he had a large family and, above all else, he was a strong family man. He was a man of great generosity and he distributed that generosity in many ways. I am sure that much of the maligning of Les Thiess came about because of this generosity and because of his friendship and his ability to give to his friends the help or assistance that at times they might need. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the last four to five years the Queensland media have reported large financial investments, by the Japanese, in this State mainly in the areas of property development and tourist associated ventures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These investments have been confirmed, particularly on the Gold Coast and Cairns&mdash;North Queensland area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the consolidation of these financial investments intelligence obtained by members of the Task Force (Bureau of Criminal Intelligence) indicates an alarming increase in the movement of the Japanese organised criminal group `the Boryokudan'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I asked Minister Cook a multi-part question about the Tasmanian oyster industry, in which I am sure you are greatly interested, Mr Acting Deputy President. The question was motivated by my knowledge that many Tasmanian oyster growers are concerned about the recent actions of the Tasmanian Department of Primary Industry and Fisheries. Their concern has been provoked because the Department has recently declared the bonamia disease as endemic to all Tasmanian waters. I quote from a letter sent from Coal River Oysters to the State Minister, the Hon. Robin Gray. In part, that letter reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The declaration causes us great concern as we have received no advice nor any consultation that provides assurances that this move is in the future best interests of our shellfish farming industry.</PARA>
<PARA>I, too, am concerned about the future best interests of Tasmania's shellfish farming industry. That is why I asked the Minister in Question Time today:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What effects has the Tasmanian action had on the oyster industry within Australia and what effect will it have on Australia's export earnings?</PARA>
<PARA>I was astounded to hear the Minister, advised by AQIS, answer:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the impact on Australian production and exports of oysters should be minimal.</PARA>
<PARA>This is in direct conflict with the advice which is readily obtained from within and without the industry itself. A Miss Joanne Wilson was quite recently employed by the Department of Primary Industry as a scientific officer on the Tasmanian Shellfish Health Survey. This is a project which was jointly funded by the industry&mdash;that is, the growers&mdash;to the tune of $35,000 and the Federal Government to the tune of $50,000. It took place over two years. Ms Wilson recently communicated with Tasmanian oyster growers to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Protozoan diseases such as MSX, QX, Bonamia and Perkinsus have been recorded from Pacific and flat oysters in other parts of the world where they have caused heavy economic losses.</PARA>
<PARA>The Tasmanian Aquaculture Cooperative Society wrote to its members in May this year to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further to concerns received from growers relating to the possible spread of Bonamia through the transference of shellfish from infected areas, implications for our future status internationally could well extend to Pacific Oysters as well as Angasis.</PARA>
<PARA>That is native oysters. Further, I quote from the same communication:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present we are awaiting the outcome of Molluscan disease control measures for Tasmania and Victoria from the OIE Annual General Session in Paris. New European Common Policy Regulations will come into effect on January 1 1993 directly relating to movements of shellfish and the placing on the market for theirs and other countries of live oysters. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From this information, world wide standards are being set now and areas with disease free status will be held at a premium on the international market.</PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that this premium is obvious when we consider the requirements of the South Australian Department of Primary Industries for the translocation of oysters into South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I quote in summary from a communication by Mr Steven Clarke, Senior Research Officer, Aquaculture, of that department in South Australia. On 18 November, under the heading `Additional requirements due to the discovery of Bonamia' there is listed in his communication the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prohibition of the translocation of native oysters from states where Bonamia has been recorded.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prohibition of the translocation of pacific oysters greater than 7 mm in size from areas (bays) in which Bonamia has been confirmed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prohibition of the translocation of Pacific oysters less than or equal to 7 mm in size from areas (bays) in which Bonamia has been confirmed unless they have been held in sterile seawater for 24 hours before shipment to South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Obviously, this readily demonstrates that there is direct, almost measurable, commercial advantage from the retention of disease-free status. Consequently, the diseased status incurs a commercial penalty which should be obvious to all, irrespective of whether they are interested in oysters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is hard, if not almost impossible, to understand why AQIS would advise the Minister just today, and I quote again from the answer that AQIS provided the Minister:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the impact of this Tasmanian Government decision on Australian production and export of oysters would be minimal.</PARA>
<PARA>Another part of the Minister's answer today is that he was advised that discussions were held at officer level between AQIS and the Tasmanian Department on the matter. If AQIS is incapable of appreciating the international and interstate trade ramifications of bonamia, then its advice is next to useless. The Minister obviously needs better advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another part of the Minister's answer today indicated that he was aware of internationally recognised methods of containing the spread of bonamia, including restriction notices on affected areas, movement restrictions and bonamia free zone classifications. These are precisely the methods recommended by the British Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in an article entitled `Impact and spread of bonamiosis in the UK' contained in a 1991 publication called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aquaculture 93</EMPHASIS> from Elsevier Science Publications, Amsterdam. In that article we are told that bonamiosis was first recognised in Europe in Brittany in 1979, that it spread quickly, and that the losses sustained soon threatened the viability of the French flat oyster industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further in that publication we are told that in France, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States of America it is considered a matter of national importance. National authorities accept the responsibility of monitoring and managing the definition of affected zones and controlling the movement of stock around the growing areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that it is not acceptable that our Minister should be aware of these international methods and yet allow the Tasmanian Government to follow this lazy, sloppily administered and economically irresponsible strategy. This Federal Government contributed funds to the survey of the health of Tasmanian shellfish. I previously quoted the scientific officer who conducted that survey when she warned of the seriousness of this matter. But she also predicted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nor is it expected that any serious disease problem will be encountered during the course of the study.</PARA>
<PARA>This was confirmed by a subsequent study, known as the May 1992 bonamia survey of Tasmanian wild flat oysters. The results of the study, prepared by J. Handlinger of the Animal Health Laboratory of the Tasmanian Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries, which were published in September 1992, read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conclusions</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The May 1992 Bonamia survey of Tasmanian wild flat oysters confirmed moderately high levels of infection (30-60% infected) in Georges Bay and Triabunna, with characteristic focal lesions in most infected oysters. Similar small lesions were more widespread around the East and South East coasts, and low numbers of Bonamia organisms were confirmed in three other locations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As Bonamia infection in other known infected countries progresses throughout summer, declining during autumn to disappear during winter, these findings could indicate that May sampling was too late in the Bonamia cycle to detect many infected oysters. Alternatively there could be other widespread causes of focal lesions&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>in other words, not bonamia&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">of this type. Another possible explanation is that most Tasmanian flat oysters succeed in destroying most Bonamia, even in summer, so that infection is not established. It is possible that all three of these mechanisms are occurring.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further survey samples collected during the summer could clarify the distribution.</PARA>
<PARA>Under the heading of `Comments', it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The focal nature of most of the lesions, the low levels of mortality shown in the heavily infected populations at Georges Bay and Triabunna, and the very small lesions and low level of infections seen in some other areas, all indicate that Bonamia is not at this stage having the devastating effect on Tasmanian flat oysters which has been seen in flat oysters of most other countries to which Bonamia has been introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The high mortalities seen in Victoria, and the apparent difference in severity between Georges Bay, Triabunna, and other infected areas of Tasmania indicates that the severity of infection is not uniform in Australian populations.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet this comment was apparently ignored, because a uniform declaration was applied by the Tasmanian State Government to the whole of the Tasmanian State waters. This is amazing. It is incompetent; it is irresponsible; it is ignorant. It defies commonsense, even considering a few basic facts, such as that earlier in the survey we are told that no flat oysters, and therefore no bonamia, were detected in the north-west and west coast areas of Tasmania. You would be aware, Mr Acting Deputy, that that is two-thirds of the State. In fact, the affected regions probably occupy an area of less than 100 hundred kilometres out of a coastline of a total of 3,200 kilometres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To put into perspective the amount of prime Australian oyster growing area which has been compromised by this idiotic Tasmanian Government decision, I point out that the total length of Victoria's coastline is 1,800 kilometres and New South Wales has just 1,900 kilometres of coastline. In other words, between the two of them they do not total the sort of area that has been wiped out of production by this stupid Tasmanian decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that the Federal Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has a responsibility to safeguard this Australian export. The federally funded shellfish health survey should be followed up by a Federal assessment of the national effects and the suitability of the decisions made by the Tasmanian Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise some major concerns that have come to my notice about the security of data held by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. There have been some recent news reports that the ABS has been slow to implement recommendations on security arrangements for foreign trade data, which is a concern not only for privacy reasons but also because of its commercial sensitivities. In addition, it would appear that the person who brought these security problems to the attention of the Bureau may have been subject to victimisation. I will come back to that staff problem later. I first wish to address the security matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Telegraph </EMPHASIS>of 18 October 1992 that security was upgraded on the ADABAS files used in the foreign trade section of the Bureau of Statistics in July this year. However, I understand that security of this data was a matter of review and concern much earlier and recommendations were made that security should have been upgraded as early as January 1991&mdash;18 months earlier than the upgrading that apparently occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been no explanation at all of the reason for the delay in making the security improvements. A delay of 18 months seems highly unsatisfactory given the sensitivity of this data. That is particularly so given that an internal ABS paper stated that password controls were `looser than they need have been and if circumvented would have contravened the need to know principle' before the July 1992 upgrade. That is all the more reason to question the very long delay. It raises questions about whether the upgrade that has now been made will ensure the full security of all foreign trade data and whether similar security can be guaranteed for all ABS data. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has also been speculation reported in the press about security breaches in 1987-88 when there were large currency transactions before the release of balance of payments data. The foreign trade data plays a major part in the compilation of the balance of payments publications. These suspected breaches were investigated by the Australian Federal Police. However, the person or persons responsible for those breaches were not identified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is of major concern that security procedures are not put in place which allow for an ineffective audit trail to allow for detection of breaches so that the perpetrators of such crimes can be brought to justice. The new security procedures must be sufficiently sophisticated to allow for such an audit trail, at least for the most highly sensitive data. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would appear that the whole episode with the foreign trade data has been handled very badly. That comes as a considerable surprise to me because until now I have had every confidence in the integrity of the ABS and its officers. They perform a very important role in the policy making environment and most Australians are touched in one way or another by the work the ABS does. That is why any security breach is all the more disturbing. Millions of people supply data to the ABS, frequently at large personal cost because of the time and effort involved. The time and effort is one thing; giving up confidential information and having it plundered is quite another and should not be allowed to continue for a minute longer if any possible security loopholes are discovered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would emphasise very strongly my view that security of data should be of paramount importance to the ABS. I am sure the Senate would be gravely concerned if lapses in security meant that respondents to data requests felt apprehensive about providing information. That would be a major threat to the personal privacy of those people and it could also badly compromise the quality of the data collected which, in turn, could lead to inappropriate policy responses which impact on us all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given those serious concerns, I have today put some questions on notice to the Bureau. I hope that the Department will answer them expeditiously in view of their significance. Very briefly, those questions are: what measures has the ABS taken to ensure that all holdings of data within the Bureau are secure? Can people be confident that the information they provide to the ABS will remain confidential? Can the Bureau provide an indication of the sorts of security measures that it uses for its data holdings? In particular, are the computer systems passwords protected? Are physical records of data&mdash;whether that data be written or on a disk or tape&mdash;kept in secure storage? How easy is it for non-ABS officers to enter  Bureau premises and access data records? Are the allegations in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Telegraph</EMPHASIS> of 18 October 1992 accurate? In particular, were there long delays in implementing the  recommendations made about improving the security of foreign trade data? If so, why was there such a long delay in implementing those recommendations?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My other serious concern is that it appears the security problems were identified by an officer who, as a result, has now been the subject of victimisation. It was reported in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Public Eye</EMPHASIS> of 19 November 1992&mdash;just a week ago&mdash;that the Bureau has been criticised by the Merit Protection and Review Agency, and by a Canberra magistrate, for improper and unfair treatment of the officer involved in exposing the security problems. If that is correct, as it appears to be, in my view that is both reprehensible and unacceptable. Such actions by officers should be encouraged at every opportunity. It is outrageous that instead of reward it seems that this action to maintain the integrity of the ABS has led to an officer being castigated and victimised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the Bureau has admitted that its management was wrong on a number of issues put before the Merit Protection and Review Agency. I have therefore also placed on notice today various questions relating to this issue. They include: do personnel practices in the Bureau encourage staff to ensure the security of data accessed? Can staff who advise management of possible security breaches or security loopholes be assured that such action will not be detrimental to their employment prospects in the Bureau or the Public Service generally? Have there been any changes to the management and personnel practices within the Bureau since receipt of the criticisms by the Merit Protection and Review Agency? If so, what is the nature of those changes?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look forward to getting a full and early response to those questions because they go to the whole issue of the public's need to have confidence in the integrity of our premier statistical agency: the Australian Bureau of Statistics. </PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3737" SPEAKER="Tate Sen The Hon M.C." NAMEID="NJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="TAS">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator Tate</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)  The Stoma Associations are established in each State and Territory to provide patients with pre and post operative counselling, advice on daily living, with drugs and stoma therapy preparations and stoma appliances. They are staffed by volunteers, who generally also have stomas, and provide a network of sympathetic and knowledgeable support and advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the introduction of the new arrangement with the Stoma Associations concern had been expressed that some patients in country areas were having difficulty in receiving their stoma therapy supplies from the Repatriation General Hospitals (RGHs). It was for this reason the Department examined the feasibility of these items being supplied from an alternative source.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision to revise the stoma arrangements was consistent with one of the main themes which emerged from the Health Review, which was the need to encourage veteran independence in the local setting, using community support networks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major consideration was also that there are twenty Stoma Associations in Australia available to supply stoma therapy items as opposed to the then six RGHs. In addition the revised arrangements constituted part of the overall plan of preparing the RGHs for integration in their respective hospital system whilst ensuring that entitled persons retained access to quality services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also many DVA beneficiaries had already chosen to become members of Associations prior to the proposal being put forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department carried out a comprehensive costing of the proposal, as well as an examination of the Stoma Appliance List to ensure its comprehensiveness for veterans' needs. It was also established that clients of the Department of Health Housing and Community Services had been successfully receiving their stoma therapy items through Stoma Associations for some time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regarding the legal issues involved, my Department acknowledged that when dealing with unincorporated associations a risk of contractual or tortious liability does exist, but analysed that risk as extremely slight. It also recognised that another Commonwealth Department was already dealing with these associations and recognised that this Department should encourage all associations to become incorporated. Any risk was also minimised by the presence of relevant insurances, since insurance companies do generally issue policies to unincorporated associations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason the risk of liability attaching to a veteran personally is low, is that it could only arise where the veteran was part of the governing committee of the association, and had become integrally involved in contracting for the association or, regarding negligence, had actually been negligent while working for the association.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) It is possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Yes. (a) Yes, until remaining associations become incorporated; (b) each case would be considered on its merits. My Department would indemnify veterans except in cases where the insurance of the Association eg public risk, covers the situation and in those cases that involve fraud on the part of the veteran; and (c) the amount of cover would depend on the circumstances and merits of the individual case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) One veteran has written on several occasions about his concerns about unincorporated associations. My Department does not know of any veteran facing personal liability for Stoma Association debts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) As I have already explained, another Commonwealth Department was using the same arrangements successfully and my Department decided that any risk was very small. There are twenty associations in Australia, fifteen of which are incorporated. Of the remaining five, one is in the process of being incorporated, one is seeing a solicitor about being incorporated, one is well insured, and another has Public Risk Insurance.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question set out in the Notice Paper on 4 November 1992 referred to the date 9 April 1991. It is my belief that this was not the honourable senator's intention and that she intended to refer to 9 April 1992. The answer is accordingly given in reference to 9 April 1992. I am advised that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Despite preliminary inquiries, the ASC is not in possession of sufficient evidence or information which would afford a reason to suspect a contravention of a national scheme law or a law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory, as is required by Section 13(1) of the Australian Securities Commission Law in order to initiate a formal investigation into share trading relating to Jupiters Limited. Therefore, the ASC has not formally investigated the purchase of shares of Jupiters Ltd shares on 9 April 1992 as the purchase of shares at that time did not represent an extraordinary trading pattern when viewed against Jupiters Limited's issued share capital of 192.4 million shares. However, if Senator Chamarette has any evidence or information relevant to this matter, I would be pleased to pass it on to the ASC.</PARA>
