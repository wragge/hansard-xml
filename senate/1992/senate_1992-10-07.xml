<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night I was highlighting the concern that all members of both this chamber and the other chamber felt about the impact of EEP and the common agricultural policy upon the primary producers in this country, especially our wheat growers. I have previously mentioned what was estimated by the OECD to be the subsidy to Australian primary producers and wheat growers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What people often fail to recognise is that any assistance we give is decoupled. That means that it does not distort production. It is assistance to farmers such as the rural adjustment scheme&mdash;the RAS scheme&mdash;which not all farmers have access to or utilise. It is not utilised by all wheat growers. It is assistance that the Government may give in matching finance with marketing and research and development. This scheme is very different from any of the sorts of schemes through which farmers are actually paid money to produce or, in some cases within the CAP, not to produce products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important that Australia continue to lead the way as we have done by taking the recent EEP moves to the GATT and requesting the GATT to further investigate and work upon this issue. We must continue our work to be the leaders, as we have been in the Uruguay Round of GATT as part of the Cairns Group. We must continue this work to make sure that agriculture stays as it has now been placed under the GATT regime and that we actually get these countries looking at how they can wean their producers off the subsidies which are not decoupled. They are definitely coupled and they definitely distort the production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, our schemes do not distort production. Our schemes provide assistance in things like marketing. They provide assistance for those farmers who have to leave the land or they provide assistance with interest rates. The assistance is not distorting the production. It is very important that we continue the work of ensuring that changes are made at an international level through the GATT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a falsehood to say that our Ministers have not been active on this. It was in fact Australia that forced this particular EEP decision to be taken to GATT with the support of other GATT members who are affected. It is also a falsehood on the part of the United States to say that it is not interfering with our markets, that EEP is not having an impact. Everybody in this country knows that that is not true. Everybody in this country knows that the United States putting its red wheat into India when we wish to put our white wheat there&mdash;our harvest is about to commence in some areas&mdash;must have an impact on world prices to some extent. It has an impact because there is so much more wheat floating around, but EEP is providing US farmers with a subsidy, a price and an income which is not able to be matched by many other places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to remember that this is an election year in the United States. I guess there are many things being said for the consumption of the local voters in that country. The election could also well be distorting the statements that are being made. One gets concerned when one hears other statements being made that the United States has large deficits and it has to do something about that because it does not appear that it is prepared to face the particular issue that EEP payments is adding towards those sorts of monetary problems it is experiencing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice with some concern that the letter from the ambassador says that the United States will continue to operate the EEP in a manner which will, to the extent possible, protect the interests of non-subsidising exporters such as Australia. One wonders, when clauses like `to the extent possible' are included, just how committed the United States is to its claim that it will protect the interests of non-subsidising exporters. I find it a little alarming to find that phrase in this particular letter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would stand by everything that has been said in this and the other chamber in support of our agricultural industry and all of our endeavours to ensure that international trade ceases to be corrupted in the manner it is by two very large and powerful groups which can `afford' to assist their farmers. But when one looks at their economic situations one begins to wonder about their capacity to continue to do this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make sure it is known to everybody in this country that everybody in this Parliament is alarmed about the EEP proposals and about the EEP actions that have taken place. Nobody in this place has the right to moral indignation on his or her own. Everyone here is concerned and it is important that that is recognised. I would like to associate myself with the previous resolution that came from this chamber and I hope that a miracle could happen in the United States taking a great deal of notice of our resolution. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are experiencing one of those very rare occasions when the whole of the Senate is supporting the wheat industry and expressing extreme disappointment with the actions of the American President and the American Department of Agriculture. It is important that we debate this issue. It is ironic that yesterday, on the very day the letter from the American Embassy was tabled, the Americans announced an EEP payment to India for the sale of one million tonnes of wheat at $100m with a subsidy of $47 a tonne.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want the chamber to debate this matter and I want this debate to be forwarded to the American Ambassador. I want him then to forward it to the appropriate authorities in America to show that there is unanimous disappointment in one chamber in Australia&mdash;by the Liberals, Nationals, Democrats, Independents, Greens and members of the left and right factions of the Labor Party&mdash;with the actions of the Americans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can take a lot from a lot of people. But one of the disappointing things that I have had to experience is the total feeling of disillusionment of the Australian farmers. They can understand the EC doing it to them and they can understand the hardships of a trade war. But what they cannot understand and what is completely frustrating to them is that their friends, the Americans, would do this to them. There is no-one more loyal to the American alliance than Australian farmers and primary producers. This is why they find it totally unacceptable that a friend could stab them in the back. They cannot understand it. I want the American Ambassador, Mr Sembler, to pass back to the appropriate authorities in America the sentiment that this chamber unanimously disagrees with the actions that the Americans have taken on wheat subsidies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 16 September the US announced that it was going to offer $32.56 a tonne subsidy for 220,000 tonnes of grain that was to be sold to Pakistan. The Americans traditionally had 1.1 million tonnes of that market. Australia had 600,000 tonnes and Canada had 600,000 tonnes. We shared that market which was not EEPed or subsidised. The Americans then came in and EEPed our 600,000 tonnes. They took 220,000 tonnes at a subsidy of $32 a tonne, despite the fact that there was never any indication that the EC was going to target that market. The Australian Wheat Board, with its market forces on the ground and its intelligence operation&mdash;it does an excellent job&mdash;said that there was never any chance of the EC attacking that market. Yet we have lost 220,000 tonnes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In September, President Bush announced an EEP increase of $1.4 billion. He was going to subsidise almost the entire US export crop, that is, 30 million tonnes, to 28 different countries&mdash;30 million tonnes of wheat equates to one-third of the world's wheat trade&mdash;and the US added countries such as South Africa, India, Yemen, Brazil and Poland. That total package was worth $4.19 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ironic part of this is that the Americans are cutting their own throats. They are subsidising other countries with their taxpayers' money when they would have had those markets anyhow. The US would have sold into both the Indian and the Pakistani markets at commercial prices, but it has effectively EEPed its own taxpayers. It never achieved a higher market; it undercut its own market. Who had to pick up the bill? The American taxpayer. The Americans never got one extra sale. They cut their own price.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ninety per cent of EEP sales have displaced US commercial sales. The USA has spent $3.4 billion up to September 1992 on EEP sales and recovered 2 per cent of the world market share for the US. The EC market share has gone up from 14.3 per cent to 20.5 per cent. After spending $3.4 billion, all the US has done is recover 2 per cent of the market. But it has had a terrible effect on the Australian price. I will come to that later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been acknowledged as a fact by the US General Accounting Office that Australian wheat farmers were more exposed to international wheat policies and received less government support than wheat farmers in any other major wheat exporting country. That is not a finding by any organisation in Australia; that is a finding by the US General Accounting Office. So that puts paid to any statements by the US farmers that the Wheat Board is some sort of communist supplied, centrally organised market and that the Wheat Board subsidises Australian farmers. That is not right and it is condemned through the mouth of that American organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What effect has EEP sales had on Australian wheat? In 1991, pool prices were depressed by some $30 to $40 a tonne. In 1980, Australia had 16 per cent of the world market. In 1984 or 1985, when the American farm bill started to EEP American wheat, Australia had 19 per cent of the world market. At the start of 1991, that 19 per cent was reduced to 13 per cent. In 1991-92, our share of the world market fell to 7 per cent. Our area and production are down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Several years ago&mdash;Senator Panizza and Senator Crane, two of the many wheat growers we know in this area, will back this up&mdash;we produced 20 million tonnes of wheat.

That is a terrible indictment of what is happening and what the CAP and the EEP programs are doing to Australian primary industry. We have reduced our proud farmers to taking handouts, and there is nothing they can do about it. It does not matter how efficient they become; they cannot get a price that allows them to grow wheat commercially and make a profit. There is less and less wheat grown as the EEP subsidies take hold and reduce the price, thus reducing the planting and the size of the wheat industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator West indicated that the saviour of this was the GATT Round. I am afraid that Senator West has more faith in the GATT Round than I have. I was one of its supporters two or three years ago. I was told by some very experienced ex-politicians that it would never work, and I decried that. In an answer the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) gave me yesterday, he said that the window of opportunity is about three weeks, and that if the Uruguay Round is not concluded in that three weeks the window of opportunity will be lost. If that window of opportunity is lost, Australia will have to decide what it is going to do with its wheat growers. It cannot leave them out there on a limb undefended and unprotected, at the whim of these two mighty superpowers, and unilaterally disarm our farmers. If that happens, we will not have a wheat industry in the future. None except a few of the bigger farmers can withstand this attack on their industry, on their living standards, and on the industries the Australian wheat growers supply, such as the milling industry. </PARA>

But if it does not happen, then we have to be able to say to these farmers, `You can't stand out there alone, unprotected'.

There are a great number of farmers out there who are terrified of signing that part D agreement. Yet for many, the dreaded part D is their only way out. It gives them $55,000 to buy a new home and move to the metropolitan area, where they are not trained to do anything, where they do not know where they will get a job and where they will join the unemployment queues. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not keep the Senate long because a number of my colleagues also wish to contribute to this debate. The debate has come about as a result of a resolution of this Senate protesting at increases in the US EEP, which is basically a subsidy, at the expense of Australian producers. The American Ambassador has responded to the Senate's protest and in effect has asked us to be patient, saying that the purpose of the EEP is to bring the Europeans to heel. He has also stressed in his letter to us that the United States will do what it can to avoid hurting innocent producers, that is, fair traders&mdash;Australian traders, Australian producers&mdash;in the course of its program. In other words, he argues that it is not directed against us; it is directed against the Europeans because it is part of the Americans' tactic to try to reduce international subsidies by applying pressure to the Europeans.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not dispute that motive. Certainly it is the original purpose of the export enhancement program. There is no doubt that the European subsidisation of agriculture is at extremely high levels and there is no doubt that it has done international damage to fair traders. I understand the original motive of the United States in a program to try to apply pressure to Europe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trouble is, however, that in doing that they are&mdash;whether it is their purpose or not&mdash;severely damaging fair traders, that is, producers such as Australia. They are doing that by forcing down the price of product. The further restructuring of EEP, the new announcements regarding the expansion of the program&mdash;certainly to the degree to which the product is subsidising the United States&mdash;will have that effect in this country also. The consequence will be, therefore, to hurt Australian producers. The Senate is certainly acting properly in protesting to the United States about that development, and it should continue to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the point I wish to make. It is vital that, despite the fact that we have such an important relationship in all respects with the United States, we continue to protest this policy it has which is having a detrimental effect upon our producers. We should do so as a Senate; the Australian Government should do so; and we as an Opposition should do so. In that light, I have to say how disappointed I was that when the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) quite reasonably protested at the extent of protectionist policies in the United States and the EEP in particular, and he was condemned by the Australian Prime Minister, Mr Keating, for doing so. How that can be in the best interests of Australia is impossible to see. Mr Keating should have commended the Leader of the Opposition for taking this issue up to the Americans, for bringing it before them. Dr Hewson made the point that, despite the fact that we have such an important relationship with the United States, in this instance, the US has a policy which is harming our producers and we protest that policy. Quite contrary to the action taken by the Prime Minister, what he should have been doing was supporting Dr Hewson in protesting this protectionist policy of the United States that is harming Australian wheat producers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Realising that he got it wrong, what did the Prime Minister of Australia, Mr Keating, do? He went to Japan and protested American policy. I cannot think of anything more diplomatically improper than the Australian Prime Minister going to Japan protesting the policies of a third nation. That is not the place to do it. The place to do it is in this country and through our mission in the United States. I regret that action by the Prime Minister of Australia, Mr Keating, which does not help Australia's interests at all. In fact, it will be counterproductive. It makes it even more difficult for us to effectively protest these policies that are harming our producers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week I was in Washington and I met with the honourable Michael Moskow, the deputy US trade representative who is responsible for this region, and also with the officials from the agriculture department, in particular, Mr Censky who was in Australia recently and heard first hand the views of Australian producers in relation to US policies. I was doing what all Australian politicians should be doing and what the Senate was doing and that was protesting these policies and the harm they cause our producers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I also sought to do with these US bureaucrats was start talking through with them whether there are not alternative policies that the US could adopt that might have a greater effect upon Europe in the way that the US claims that the program is designed. In other words, the subsidisation of the US wheat crop is not, in my view, a way that is effectively going to bring Europe to heel. I said to Mr Censky that if his argument is right, surely the logical progression of that argument is that the US should further increase its subsidies. I asked, `Should it double it? Should it treble it?' Of course, the answer I got was that, no, they did not think that would be desirable. I am pleased to hear that. But that really means that they, in effect, acknowledge that it is not working. There is no suggestion that the US EEP has had any effect upon European policies and European subsidies at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is some hope in Europe, particularly in the announcements last year of reform to the CAP. But there is no suggestion that that has been as a result of pressure from the United States through the EEP. Rather it is as a result of Europe very slowly realising the extent to which it is disadvantaging its community as a whole by paying these enormous subsidies to a minority of that community. Therefore, I said to the Americans, `This policy or argument, as you put it, is not working and therefore you should be looking for alternatives'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I discussed with them the Australian initiative last year to seek to publicise in Europe to Europeans the cost to them of subsidies. This was a program the Australian Government commenced but abandoned almost as quickly as it started because a bit of pressure was applied from Europe. Nevertheless, the US has the capacity to put in a lot more resources. Looking at the extent of resources it is putting into subsidies, it could be putting those resources into a program to communicate the damaging effect of subsidies within Europe. That is an alternative they could be considering. I raised that with them and discussed it with them. I also raised with the United States whether more programs might be developed to retaliate more directly against specific subsidies in Europe, something that can give the effect of these subsidies greater focus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other options that our Government&mdash;Mr Keating, his Ministers and his bureaucrats&mdash;should be putting to the US Government. That is what we want. We want some action. It is no good the Government simply coming in here and saying, as Senator Evans did yesterday, that our only hope is the GATT, our only hope is the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round, and that we will keep moving along that path. The Uruguay Round started in 1986 and still has not been successfully concluded. If it is, that will be to our advantage; I do not dispute that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the meantime, there were other tactics that could have been adopted and other pressures that could have been applied. The Australian Government should have been applying these pressures; it should have been looking for new and more imaginative ways to apply pressure both to the United States and to Europe and, therefore, doing something positive for the benefit of Australian wheat growers, rather than simply putting all our eggs in the GATT basket, which so far has failed to reach a successful conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even at this late stage, I urge the Australian Government, which has not done enough in this area for the benefit of Australian producers, to get out there and pursue some of these other options, to be seen to be doing something positive for the benefit of Australian producers, rather than what it has done to date, and that is simply to rely upon the GATT and the Uruguay Round, which to date has not succeeded. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise also to speak on this motion relating to the letter received from the American Ambassador, Mr Mel Sembler. I shall make a number of points that I think are relevant to the debate. I particularly support Senator Hill's concluding comments about other actions the Government could take to help overcome the problem we have now, which I intend to address myself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much is being made, quite correctly, of the fact that this part of the EEP is directly related to the current American presidential election. However, I well remember putting to Jim Parker, the American Agricultural Attache&mdash;I think it was in 1987-88, when the EEP was in place&mdash;exactly the same arguments we went through the other day with Mr Steven Censky about what the Americans were doing to the Australian wheat industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not excuse what the Europeans have done; however, I think there are other methods, as Senator Hill has mentioned, by which we can attack them to get them to change their policy, other than using GATT on its own. What the Americans did then and what they are doing now by their actions is depressing world wheat prices by approximately $30 a tonne. They depressed them then by up to $50 a tonne and they are doing it again now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia will sell all its wheat. We learnt in the years from 1969 to 1971, when we tried to introduce quotas and store wheat in Australia, that those measures did not work. Firstly, it was impossible to get equity between growers with quotas; but, more importantly, with Australian climatic conditions, we could not successfully store wheat because of problems with moisture and weevils in storage. Since then, Australia has met the market price and we have sold our wheat. As far as our wheat industry is concerned and the types of wheat we produce&mdash;whether it be the hard wheats or the soft wheats&mdash;in meeting the world markets we also have a quality advantage that other countries do not have. That has always put us in a favourable position for clearing our stocks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The actions of the Americans in this case have left us in a very vulnerable position as far as price is concerned. The Americans have to recognise that they are not going to pinch Australian market share because we will meet the price. We have done that previously; we sell most of our wheat through international contracts which have been in place for many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting that on a year-in year-out average, approximately 80 per cent of Australian wheat is sold government agency to government agency&mdash;in our case, Australian Wheat Board contracts. Very little trading of Australian wheat is done by private grain traders. That is the nature of the Australian wheat industry and that is how it has operated very successfully for a long time. That is the first point the Americans have to understand, and it is a point that a number of us have tried to make in previous debates and discussions we have had on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking further at the letter from Mr Sembler, the last paragraph particularly annoys me because I have heard the point made so often:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You may be assured that we will continue to operate our Export Enhancement Program in a manner which will, to the extent possible, protect the interests of non-subsidising exporters such as Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>If America, Europe or any other country is going to dump product, in this case wheat, into the world markets which effectively depresses the price, there is nothing that can be done to protect anybody from that drop in price. That comment of Mr Sembler's is an absolute nonsense, as I said before. I spoke about this to Mr Jim Parker and others in 1987 and I made those points to President Bush when he was here. He answered me by saying, in effect, `I now understand the problem you have. It is not a case of us pinching Australian markets. It is a case of us depressing the price and affecting Australian growers in that way'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other tragedy&mdash;and Senator Boswell mentioned it very succinctly&mdash;is the hardship and the poverty this action has caused many Australian wheat growers, particularly in parts of New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia. There is a flow-on effect to the machinery dealers, the local storekeepers and so on. It also affects the Australian economy as a whole in our endeavours to balance our current account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I could talk for a moment about some of the recent programs, the Indian sale is very disturbing. The Pakistan situation is also disturbing, but for very different reasons. Since this latest program has been put in place wheat has been sold to Bangladesh, Pakistan and Egypt&mdash;598,000 tonnes to Egypt, 10,000 tonnes to Bangladesh and 220,000 tonnes to Pakistan. Under the Indian program it is envisaged that the Americans will sell 1.5 million tonnes. There has been a subsidisation of approximately $US30 a tonne, which is almost the direct impact on the world wheat price. One has to understand&mdash;I am sure it is something the current Australian Government does not understand&mdash;that approximately 100 million tonnes per annum of wheat is traded in the world. About 15 million tonnes of that is white wheat and the remainder, approximately 85 million tonnes, is red wheat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia produces about 10 million tonnes or two-thirds of the traded white wheat in the world. Europe does not produce any traded white wheat, America produces a small percentage of it, and the rest is spread around a number of countries. When America moved into Pakistan, Mr Censky tried to justify this by saying that the Europeans might go into Pakistan. It was not that they would go into Pakistan, or that they were in Pakistan, but that they might go into Pakistan with their red wheat. It is a well known fact&mdash;and this is where I believe the Australian Government failed in terms of the announcements on EEP and the additional countries it was said were being targeted&mdash;that on that day our people, at ministerial and prime ministerial level, should have been making the right noises, letting the Americans know quite clearly before the action had been taken that, in terms of the Pakistan market, it was not a market that had been under threat or was traditionally under threat, nor was there much potential for it to be under threat by the actions of the Europeans, because of the very nature of the product that is grown. That, of course, is the difference between red and white wheats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the argument that has been put to us over the years related to the regaining of the market share that the United States alleged had been taken from it by the Europeans and that its action was to regain that market share by subsidising into those markets. That market, in the words of Jim Parker in 1987, had been taken from it, and those words have been reiterated time and again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the position which exists in terms of this letter and the position that has been put to us by the United States is no longer valid in terms of what it said with regard to its original intention which it has repeated consistently as far as EEP is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point that needs to be made is that while the US share, as a percentage of the traded world wheat market, has decreased, its actual tonnage of world traded wheat has marginally increased. While it says that it has had markets taken from it, the world traded wheat market has expanded over recent years. As I said&mdash;and I repeat this; this is the message that needs to be spelt out very clearly by the Government to the Americans&mdash;its tonnage of world traded wheat has increased, not decreased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the Indian situation. The Indian situation is quite tragic in terms of the further development and expansion of EEP. India is not a traditional market for wheat for anybody, or has not been in recent years. India has been basically self-sufficient and has in fact been a net exporter of wheat. So any claim that the Americans were regaining part of their share of what the Europeans may have taken in terms of the Indian market is absolutely and totally false. Had the Americans, as the Australians and others have done, gone in there under the same market conditions without subsidising the product into India and further depressing world market prices, they would have been able to obtain their fair share of that market, as it is an opportunistic market in terms of wheat that can be sold to India. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting that there is a very significant difference between the markets in Pakistan and India. Pakistan is a traditional white wheat market; India is not a traditional market for anybody. It just so happens that, because of seasonal conditions which have occurred in India and the fact that it has not had its normal levels of production and its stockpiles have been run down, it is rebuilding those particular stockpiles. If America or any other country wishes to give aid to a particular country at a particular time because it has had harsh seasonal conditions, then it should be done in such a way that does not distort world trade and does not depress world prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have not had one word from the Government about the intricacies of these two markets. The Government, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Mr Kerin) and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) have failed dismally the Australian wheat growers, their service industries and the Australian economy in not spelling out the correct position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Hill said in his speech, when Dr Hewson made some comments and was critical of the American position, was there support for the position he adopted? The answer is no. Instead, the Prime Minister got stuck into Dr Hewson. Of course, Dr Hewson was absolutely correct, and that was borne out once again by our `offshore' Prime Minister when he chose to attack America from Japan in the same way as he denigrated our flag when he was in Papua New Guinea. There was much that could have been done by the Australian Government about those two markets in particular and the relationship between the European position and the American position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to go a little further and talk about the GATT Round and what can be done and achieved. Nobody in this place, or in the other place for that matter, would not want us to pursue the GATT Round as hard as we can, but there are more ways than one to skin a cat. We have to look at options and alternatives in overcoming our problems with our trading position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Hill mentioned, there is potential in Europe through its program for some high-powered publicity of the cost of the subsidisation of the program to the consumer. This is not very far different to some of the debate which has occurred in Australia in recent years concerning the cost of various programs, particularly relevant to protection, and what it has cost individuals within Australia. That is just one way by which it can be pursued. While we all support the development of multilateral trading arrangements, there is also potential for bilateral trading arrangements which will sit quite comfortably alongside multilateral trading arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude my remarks by saying that the other thing that can be done here in Australia to overcome the difficulty that this has caused Australian wheat growers is for the Government itself to get the Government monkey off the back of grain growers and others. I refer in particular to the cost of protection to grain growers, the cost of transport, the impact of the fuel excise, the flow-on effects of payroll tax, many of the problems we have in the meat industry, for example, the lack of reform in our abattoirs in this country. There is a whole range of things that can be done internally that have nothing to do with the Americans, the Europeans, or anybody else for that matter, but us. Those are actions that can be taken here and now. I put it to the Government that it really is an opportune time to move on some of these add-on costs that grain growers and others in the community bear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This letter is very disappointing in its content. It is no different from what was being said five or six years ago. The American position on EEP and what it was supposed to do has not won back part of the so-called loss of market share that they lost to the Europeans, although one has to question that having regard to the fact that American sales in tonnes have not fallen on world markets. Australia has to look at every option in bringing pressure to bear both on the Europeans and on the Americans for the injustice that they have perpetuated on Australian wheat growers, who, as I said in my earlier comments, do meet the market and sell their grain but take the depressed price. </PARA>

<PARA>This has gone on for a long time. It started even further back than that. On 5 September I led a group of National Party parliamentarians and others to the American Embassy to protest what was happening. I took a letter from Tim Fischer, the Leader of the National Party, carrying a formal resolution to the Embassy to say that we were very concerned at what was happening. At our conference in Canberra on 5 September, we were worried about the dramatic extension of the export enhancement program for wheat, which had the potential to corrupt world trade to the same extent that it had in 1986 and in 1990 and which would further depress the prices received by Australian wheat growers. That point has already been very clearly made by Senator Crane and others in this debate; indeed, it was made by Senator Bishop when she led the debate last night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other parts of American programs have also concerned Australian primary producers for quite a long time. They include the increased use of export subsidy programs for dairy products, the extension of the EEP to canned fruit and possibly to other grains and agricultural exports from America, and the further reduction of Australia's access to the US sugar market. We export to America some 97,000 tonnes, which is down from 168,000 tonnes two years ago and 800,000 tonnes 10 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a pecuniary interest in that I am a wheat and beef producer. Being a beef producer, I am also concerned about the imposition of restrictive meat quotas which were voluntarily imposed halfway through this year. We are told that there is going to be quite a lot of beef in bond by the end of the year. That is another problem for our primary producers in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But where did all this start? It started with the humbug from Humboldt's speech on Wednesday, 2 September. As an Australian who is very friendly with the United States, I have cause for concern. In that speech, President Bush said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make this comment to those friends of ours overseas also. Let me be clear. This action is aimed at those who subsidize, not at those such as Australia and others who do not subsidize. And today's wheat EEP initiatives will give farmers, exporters, and buyers more certainty about market opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA>It might be all right for the Americans, but it is not too good for Australian export industries. As Senator Crane made quite clear, we export a great proportion of wheat. About 100 million tonnes of wheat is traded around the world. If America through its EEP subsidises 30 million tonnes, which is about a third of that, it is obviously going to cause problems even to our white wheat exports. If nothing else, this will depress the price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important for us all to address why America is doing this. The Office of the Press Secretary of the White House said on 2 September that the problem that the US wheat producers face is the highly subsidised competition from the EC. The European Community's wheat export subsidies average about $125 a tonne; the export subsidies from the United States are only going to average about $40 a tonne. But I wonder whether two wrongs make a right. I wonder whether this is going to bring a quicker resolution to the GATT Uruguay Round. If it does not, all it is going to do in the meantime is further corrupt our world trade, and that is something that I believe will cause further problems down the line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of people do not understand what EEP is. We know that the Americans are doing this because they want to have a crack at the Europeans. As I have been saying for the last few years, there is no doubt that the Europeans are the baddies. But just because the United States has a crack at them does not mean that the Americans are the goodies. The United States is just as bad as the Europeans if it wants to corrupt the world trade as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what does the export enhancement program do? It enables the US exporters to meet prevailing world prices for targeted commodities and destinations. Under the program the USDA pays cash bonuses to US exporters. The bonuses make up the difference between the US domestic price and the world price, which is often lower because the European Economic Community and other subsidising exporters dump surplus production into the world markets. Australia, a good trader, trades into those markets. Obviously this will distort the market and cause problems for the Australian wheat growers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a quick look at the problems for the Australian wheat growers. In 1970, a tonne of Australian wheat bought 2,200 litres of fuel. By 1991, a tonne of wheat bought only 200 litres of fuel, and it buys approximately that amount at the moment. It is well for this chamber to note that a recent study by ABARE suggests that, over this period, the agricultural sector has increased productivity in Australia at double the rate of the other economic sectors, which is great for our farmers. In the last two decades, the annual productivity growth in the broadacre industries has increased 2.2 per cent compared to 1.3 per cent in the manufacturing sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The farmers of Australia have bust their guts and done everything they can to increase productivity and to work more efficiently. This article by the National Australia Bank makes it very clear that the long term trends imply that technical progress in the rural industries will continue at a satisfactory level. However, more recent trends, particularly in the cropping industry, point to an alarming decline in inputs over a prolonged period from 1982 to the present. This is mirrored by a sharp fall in some of the outputs since 1986. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a survey of 106 farmers in southern New South Wales, 72 per cent reported static or declining crop yields and 67 per cent claimed static or declining livestock production. We now have the problem of having to be leaner than lean and meaner than mean to try to compete against these countries that are distorting trade around the world, of which America is one. That will cause horrific problems to the Australian wheat growers in the next year or so while we try to compete against an American coffer which will continue its EEP program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, this chamber is angry and cranky about America's actions because Australia sold 500,000 tonnes of wheat to India just recently and had been hoping to pick up some more sales there. Senator Crane made it quite clear what happened: the Americans have now put one million tonnes of heavily subsidised wheat into India. With that assault on our market there, it does not look like there will be much left for us to be able to sell to India. The bottom line of all that is that the European Community has hardly put a load of wheat&mdash;it might have put one&mdash;into India in the last few years. So this action will not hurt the European Community; it will hurt only the traditional allies of the United States of America, one of which is Australia. That is where my anger lies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If President Bush was fair dinkum when he said that he would not hurt Australia, being an ally of the United States and a country that did not subsidise&mdash;he spelt it out in his speech in Humboldt&mdash;surely he would say to the Americans, `Why don't we target some of the markets that the European Community is putting its wheat into and not the markets that the Australians are putting their wheat into'. I support the motion moved by Senator Bishop yesterday to take note of the reply of the United States Ambassador. I hope that this Senate very clearly sends another message to the Embassy that gets sent back to Washington which says, `Listen here, fellows. Do not hit the Australians with the back swing of your baseball bat. Go back and play in your own league. Hit the Europeans over the head, because they are the real culprits'. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XF4">Senator CRICHTON-BROWNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Patterson. The response to the resolution of the Senate really manifests all the problems of this issue. This issue is brought to us by the recent US sales to India and by the fact that the President of the United States is 20 points behind in the polls and fears that he will not be re-elected. He has gone to the mid-west of the United States trying to buy votes. The tragedy is that it does not seem to be working. Ultimately, we are paying an awful price for his endeavours. Without wishing to preach to the Americans, every dollar that subsidises the US wheat growers is either another dollar onto the American deficit or another dollar taken away from appropriate budget outlays.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Putting aside the immediate sales into India, the truth of the matter is that the Americans are not the primary enemy in this matter. The Americans did not start this war and George Bush is doing little more than responding to the gross and obscene politics of the European nations. That is driven not by economic judgments but again by political judgments. Because the French farmers have such enormous muscle, along with the Germans and, to a lesser degree, the British, they are able to drive the political agenda for the EEC. That has been the exclusive reason that we have not had any breakthroughs in GATT or the Uruguay Round or any other negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tragedy for Australia is that we have highly efficient, effective and unsubsidised farmers who are now having their markets tainted by the United States retaliation against the Europeans. It is related to both politics with the EEC and domestic politics with George Bush. There is no sensible, logical or good reason why the Australian markets should suffer collateral damage as a result of the conflict between the EEC and the United States. The United States could wage its war with the EEC without visiting any of our markets. However, for political reasons, it has chosen not to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This conflict shows one thing&mdash;that is, that the words proffered by George Bush when he visited Australia were thoroughly hollow. But that comes as no surprise because this Government believes that its foreign affairs policies can be driven on friendship and goodwill and little Bob Hawke slapping George Bush on the back, or whoever his friend for the day is, or Paul Keating developing a new-found friendship. The truth is that foreign affairs is driven by self-interest. What is in the interests of one nation will reflect in its attitude towards its allies and its enemies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that I do not agree with anybody who argues that there ought to be any linkage on economic or political grounds between this matter and the matter of US bases on Australian shores. If it is wrong for defence reasons and if it is wrong because it creates a threat or a perceived threat in the minds of some, that does not change because of an economic dispute between Australia and the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am appalled that John Malcolm Fraser or anybody else would now seek to make that linkage on the basis of economic arguments. If economic arguments were ever capable of influencing whether the bases ought to be on Australian soil, surely they ought not ever have been here. If the bases are here for our security, for world peace, as is properly argued by all of us, that premise cannot be shifted simply because there is a dispute between the American farmers and the Australian farmers. If we can say that the bases are negotiable now, it means that they are negotiable on any term, and if they are negotiable on any term, save for defence and security arrangements, it was the wrong judgment to have them here in the first place. It is obscene to make that linkage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can understand the Democrats making that linkage. They have argued all along, with some purity in their argument, that the bases should never have been here. All they are doing now is using this argument to reinforce their earlier argument. But for anybody to now say that they ought to come into the equation as a political element is simply destroying the fundamental argument upon which the bases have previously been founded. It adds nothing to our relationship with the United States, it adds nothing to the economic debate and it adds nothing to the defence and security arrangements debate to somehow argue that because the Americans are dumping wheat in traditional Australian markets we no longer need security and defence arrangements with the United States in our own interests. I support the motion to take note of the response. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise briefly to pick up the point that Senator Crichton-Browne made a moment ago. I thank him for raising the issue of the Democrats and the bases, stressing that we have always opposed the bases. But he is slightly wrong in drawing the conclusion that, if the argument for the bases originally was valid, it remains valid today. Circumstances have changed considerably. We have seen the end of the Cold War. The need for the bases has shifted quite substantially. Given those circumstances, and given the fact that many of us believe that the bases were more to do with American defence than with Australian defence, they are more negotiable today than they ever were. It is in that context that we have argued that perhaps one should reconsider the position of the bases. Indeed, a number of farmers around Australia have been making those suggestions. In Western Australia, where I was the week before last, there is very considerable hardship among the farming community, not least because of the activities of the Americans and the Europeans in relation to support for exports. The additional EEP scheme is simply the latest blow to Australian farmers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that the Australian Government has been tardy in offering support to Australian farmers. We have argued very considerably that there should be a guaranteed minimum price for wheat which should underpin the wheat price when the price falls&mdash;not that we want to return to the sort of support which was given to the wool industry, where the minimum price did not remain a minimum price but followed the world price up as it increased, leaving us with considerable stockpiles of wool. We support a minimum price which guarantees to farmers in times of depressed world prices a price which returns to the farmer the cost of planting the wheat and which at least guarantees that there will be a crop next year so that during those troughs in the market farmers are not wiped out. We strongly urge on the Government the reintroduction of such a scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point I make very briefly is that one thing which this present debacle does show is that Australia is manifestly stupid in pursuing a policy of zero tariffs, of stripping away all protection, all support, for our own industry, while other countries are supporting their industries. We need to learn a lesson&mdash;the Opposition certainly needs to learn a lesson&mdash;from the damage being done to Australian wheat producers by this scheme, damage which they have very strongly attested to in the debate this morning. It needs to learn that in a world where there is still very substantial protection&mdash;indeed, where most of the OECD countries have increased protection for their industry&mdash;it is really stupid for Australia to pursue the alternative path. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is our view that zero tariffs in Australia would really equate with zero jobs, with zero industry; that Australia, being a small country, needs protection of its industry. Again we would urge the Government to take a lesson from what is happening to our wheat farmers and apply it more generally to industry</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;In exercising my right of reply in the debate on the motion I moved last evening, I take the opportunity to answer one or two of the points made by Senator Coulter in his last intervention and then to perhaps restate some of the salient points of the debate as it relates to a motion that was passed by the entire Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Firstly, in my view, the bases question is a stand-alone question and is not related to a trade question. Secondly, however, Senator Coulter used this debate as an opportunity to advance his Party's high taxing policy&mdash;and, to the other taxes that he would impose upon the Australian people, he adds an additional tariff tax. He wishes to see tariff taxes, which he talked about in connection with the general issue of so-called `protectionism'&mdash;a word that I choose not to use because it is a warm and fuzzy word, when what we are really talking about is tariff tax where we tax that group of people over there and give it to this group of people over here because they are special. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, our farmers, about whose plight we are all concerned, are people who are forced to pay tariffs; but, as tariffs will be reduced to the 5 per cent level under our policy, they will benefit enormously. When we couple that with micro-economic reform in terms of transportation costs, the farmers will again benefit. Until Senator Coulter's intervention, none of the arguments canvassed in the debate had dealt at all with the question of a minimum price, such as the Democrats wish to impose, except for Senator Crane, who dealt with the question most adequately when he explained that the attempted quota system which had been used previously penalised the farmers themselves. In other words, if we have giants fighting, as would be the case with a large dispute between the United States and the European Community, it is not an area where we can compete with subsidies in any way, shape or form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole strength of our argument is that we are efficient farmers. We want the right to compete internationally in the market where we have a competitive edge. Indeed, we still will sell our wheat, which is a point that has been made again and again by speakers in the debate. But the issue is this: the United States action in extending its export enhancement program will mean that our farmers' profit, which they were entitled to earn by diligence of hard work, effort and efficiency, will be denied them because the price that the international community will pay will be lowered by the action of the United States Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very simply, as I said right at the beginning in moving the motion, we do not accept that the reason for the extension of the EEP is to attempt to bring the economic community to the GATT table to bring about a satisfactory resolution of the Uruguay Round. We all aim at seeing the Europeans come to the sensible conclusion that the CAP, the common agricultural policy, has to alter; that there has to be room for people who are efficient agricultural traders to see the benefit and seek rewards for their effort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Europeans wish to implement a system of subsidies for their farmers, which in fact is a virtual social welfare policy to maintain certain populations in different parts of their countries, then they should please not ask us to pay for it. If George Bush wants to attract votes from the mid-west, with Governor Clinton appearing even more anxious to use the same technique, they should please not ask us to pay for it. If there are policies of subsidies which countries wish to use, then they must bear the cost of that subsidy themselves and must not impose it upon the international trading system, as it distorts not only the trade in that particular area but all trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The message that we give to the United States concerning the extension of the EEP is the same message that we take to the European Community concerning the CAP; it is the same message we take to Japan concerning its refusal to allow the importation to Japan of rice; and it is the same message that we use when we say that we are committed in Australia to a multilateral trading system with room for bilaterals which are consistent with that multilateral structure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are a nation that says the whole world benefits when there is free trade among nations. The post-World War II period has shown that the bringing down of tariff levels worldwide has enabled enormous world growth to take place. That growth has enabled newly industrialising economies to take off, developing countries to get a start to grow into more substantial partners, and the OECD countries to enjoy greater trading benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anything that impinges upon the ability of world trade to grow and for more and more countries to give a higher standard of living to their individual citizens, to my way of thinking, is a policy which stands condemned. That is the basis upon which I moved this motion to take note of the letter from the United States Ambassador last evening to say that we simply do not accept that subsidising a product and thereby distorting international trading practices is acceptable. The argument that the United States perpetually uses, that it is only there to fight the Europeans, just does not add up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I pointed out last night when I mentioned that I had read the remarks from Mr Baker, whereby he told the Australians to stop whingeing, not only is the policy to extend the EEP penalising efficient traders such as Australia and individual farmers but it is also exacerbating the problem in the United States because once subsidies are introduced the price of land is altered, the status of mortgages is changed and very often banks are put at risk because when that subsidy is taken away the reverse occurs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there are many aspects to this question which are pertinent not only to the Australian farmer and the Australian nation as a whole but also to the farmers and to the economic system within the United States. The spectacle of the two candidates for the presidency of the United States, President Bush and Governor Clinton, trying to outbid each other on how much subsidy they can pay to farmers, which in turn distorts the world market, is a most dispiriting spectacle indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why we originally passed the resolution which was sent on to His Excellency, and His Excellency has told us in his letter that that message has been sent on to Washington. It is a most serious issue. It is a most serious manner in which this Senate has chosen to take note of Ambassador Sembler's letter, and I trust he will read the debate with great interest. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Federal Airports Corporation Regulations, as contained in Statutory Rules 1992 No. 255 and made under the Federal Airports Corporation Act 1986, be disallowed.</PARA>
<PARA>This motion relates to the disallowance of the regulations made under the Federal Airports Corporation Act. It is really a most astonishing move by the Government to exempt the Federal Airports Corporation from having to comply with State laws in relation to the preparation of an EIS in relation to the third runway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the debate on this motion some three weeks ago, when I sought to have the Standing Orders suspended in order that the motion could be debated before the issue was heard in the High Court, I expressed the outrage that the Australian Democrats felt and, in fact, the outrage that many community groups in Sydney felt, at this action of the Federal Government in seeking once again to exempt one of its statutory corporations from State planning and environment laws that would otherwise apply to its activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This, of course, is a very important issue in Sydney. The third runway, as honourable senators would be aware, has been a very contentious issue. It has been a very contentious issue in the suburb in which I live, Bondi, and certainly across Sydney there is widespread concern, and has been so for some time, about the construction of the third runway. I am sure that that concern will be heightened now, in light of the recent accident in Amsterdam which tragically caused so much loss of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The regulations before us today are nothing more than an attempt by the FAC in collusion with the Minister to exempt the FAC from the New South Wales Environmental Protection Act. Every other citizen and corporation in New South Wales is bound by the Environmental Protection Act and we are asking, `Why should the FAC be placed above the laws which the rest of us are forced to comply with?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an exercise of unsurpassed cynicism that the Federal Government has here produced a regulation which would subvert the legal processes of appeal to the New South Wales Land and Environment Court. These regulations were put forward as a desperate attempt to circumvent the local government appeal to the Land and Environment Court which is scheduled for hearing later this month. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned earlier, we have seen the Federal Government use this device of simply exempting their bodies from the State planning and environment laws in relation to ANSTO at Lucas Heights. We saw it attempt to do this successfully with the support of the Opposition back in June of this year in a move which was greeted by outrage by State governments all across Australia. Here the Federal Government, with the collusion of the Opposition, is once again seeking to put its own activities above laws which would otherwise apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of concern has been expressed about the environmental impact statement produced in respect of the third runway. It is worth mentioning and noting that that EIS was produced under Commonwealth environmental planning laws, not State planning laws. The concern that Botany Municipal Council and other councils have raised before the Land and Environment Court is that really this issue should have been assessed under the New South Wales planning and environment laws which are in fact much stronger than those in place at a Federal level. That has not happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of concern has been expressed about whether the EIS has in fact dealt with all the concerns raised by the community. For example, it has been cited that the draft EIS is inadequate on a number of points, including its failure to take account of a $400m reduction in property values caused by new and added aircraft noise. It is believed that the draft EIS has failed to take into account the need to spend at least $300m at Kingsford-Smith Airport if downgrading the east-west runway is not realistic, as appears to be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been suggested that the EIS fails to take into account the need to spend at least $100m to satisfy the Civil Aviation Authority call for land reclamation to avoid the greatly increased risk of bird strike causing aircraft crashes. In addition, the EIS has failed to take into account the millions of dollars required to compensate people for relocating their homes or soundproofing them against aircraft noise which will greatly increase as a result of the third runway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the issue that the Botany Municipal Council is most concerned about is that of the dredging of Botany Bay where it has been revealed that some 15 million cubic metres of sediment will be taken from Botany Bay in order to assist with the construction of the runway. That may have absolutely devastating effects on the environment of the Botany Bay region. The FAC wishes to go ahead and dredge Botany Bay despite the fact that previous dredging of the bay in the region of the Penrhyn Estuary was stopped by the Department of Public Works because it contained toxic waste. This waste included heavy metals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concern of the local community groups is that this issue has not been adequately covered by the environmental impact statement. The 15 million cubic metres of material that the FAC intends to dredge may well include similar concentrations of toxic material. The dredging of the bay will also destroy an area which is recognised as the second largest fish breeding area in New South Wales and one of the largest oyster farming areas in the State. That is an enormously important primary industry to the region of Botany Bay which could be totally destroyed by the dredging of 15 million cubic metres of sediment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also worth nothing that the Kurnell area is an important bird migration region. Whether we like it or not, those birds are there, they have been going there for centuries, and they will continue to go there until the environment is so devastated and destroyed that they will have to move elsewhere. That is an issue that also needs to be put on the table. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do believe that it is time to reassess the validity of having a major airport in a metropolitan area in light of the recent crash which occurred in Amsterdam. This was a very tragic accident which saw at least 250 people killed. It has even been suggested that the number of people killed by that accident may never be fully known because of the number of illegal immigrants who were living in that area of Amsterdam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was a tragic accident, but it is the sort of accident that community groups concerned about the third runway have warned could happen here in Australia. Yet we are considering increasing traffic at an airport located effectively in the middle of a major city. It is important that that issue be reassessed in the light of this tragic accident. The Citizens Airport Environment Association put out a press statement yesterday claiming that such an accident was highly possible in the Sydney region. The press release states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The EIS for the third runway points out that, rather than reducing risk north of the airport, residents of Marrickville, for example, will be subject to a risk of death from an air crash about 2.5 times greater than at present.</PARA>
<PARA>That is if the third runway is constructed. The press release goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In working papers for the draft EIS, Marrickville was shown as having a current risk of 42 fatalities per million per year by the year 2010 if a third runway is constructed. This risk would have increased to 103 per million per year.</PARA>
<PARA>It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This massively exceeds New South Wales Government recommendations for risk criteria for land use safety planning, as specified in Department of Planning publication Hazardous Industry Planning Advisory Paper No. 4 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The paper specifies that the risk criteria for residential land use is one fatality per million per year. We are now talking of a possible increase in fatalities to 103 per million per year. The third runway will therefore mean that residents north of Sydney Airport will face a risk of death from air crash over 100 times greater than New South Wales Department of Planning guidelines. Hospitals and schools will have a risk imposed upon them 200 times greater than the guidelines recommend.</PARA>
<PARA>These statistics do not take into account possible multiplier effects such as a crash into the huge chemical and petrochemical storage sites adjacent to the airport. It should be recognised that an air crash into those important petrochemical facilities would be absolutely disastrous, not only for Kurnell but for all of Cronulla and that region of Sydney as a whole. That is something that I think local residents have every right to be very concerned about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is our concern that, if these regulations were passed, State environment law would become irrelevant. They establish a precedent; in fact, that precedent has already been established by the passage of the ANSTO Amendment Bill last June. It establishes a precedent for circumventing environmental legislation requirements for any project, any time, anywhere. The FAC has been given the power to shop around for the environmental standard that best suits its empire building. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have said that if the Federal Airports Corporation believes that the environmental impact statement it has produced is totally adequate, it has nothing to fear from having this matter heard in the Land and Environment Court in New South Wales. However, if the EIS is found to have been inadequate, then of course it has something to fear. That is why we believe the Federal Government has moved in this way to ensure that the FAC will be exempt from those planning and environment laws that apply to everyone else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the potential to destroy the ecology of Botany Bay, this Government is now trying to regulate to allow the FAC to do what it likes and not to be accountable to the people who will suffer at its hands. I draw the Senate's attention to the unanimous objection to the FAC's plans of the municipal councils in the area, environmental, social and recreational groups and representative groups from the fishing industry. The move allows the FAC to decimate a sensitive environment and to disregard the objections of citizens of New South Wales and other concerned Australians that did not begin with this underhand attempt to put the FAC outside the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third runway assessment report was railroaded into Cabinet by Ros Kelly. The public was denied an opportunity to comment on what is one of the major urban environmental issues in Australia. It certainly is the major environmental issue facing Sydney at this time. The report, when it was finally made public, made it patently clear that the FAC does not care about the environment or about the many people whose lives will be affected. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The FAC puts priority on minimising inconvenience to passengers and costs to airlines rather than environmental quality north of Sydney Airport.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But the FAC is not honouring its own priorities. By dredging the bay, the FAC is placing airline passengers and staff at greater safety risks. The Seamen's Union has brought to the attention of the Democrats' leader, Senator Coulter, its serious concerns about the safety of air travellers should a sea rescue ever have to take place in the bay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would hope that the Opposition would recognise what a serious attack these regulations are on States rights. I know that last time I spoke on this matter, Senator Cook quite rightly pointed out to me that the Democrats have never really been big supporters of States rights. We certainly believe that many areas of government activity would benefit from having a more coordinated approach across the States with the Federal Government on a whole range of legislative issues, and the environment is certainly one of those. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that certainly business and commercial activity would greatly be enhanced by the standardisation of a range of laws across the States to ensure that business operates in the same kind of regulatory environment from east to west and from north to south. But what we have at the moment is a whole range of different laws covering the same issues in a range of different States and this makes business very difficult to operate in this country. It is time that the States got together&mdash;I know there has been some progress on this but it has been at a snail's pace&mdash;to ensure that we are operating in the same regulatory climate right across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The very important area of environmental law would benefit from a more standard approach to legislating within the States and with the Commonwealth. But what we have at the moment, both in environmental law, business regulation, workers compensation, stamp duties and a whole range of other State charges, is a huge hotchpotch of legislation which differs from State to State and which makes governing Australia very difficult. We would ask the Government to accelerate that process to ensure that there is some certainty in legislating and some certainty in the business climate around Australia. That is not happening at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But be that as it may. I am very concerned that this Government is arrogantly overriding the States. It is arrogantly saying, `We will simply exempt ourselves from those laws because we do not like them. Because we feel that we have complied with the Commonwealth law, therefore the State laws do not need to apply'. As a result, we are seeing an increase in this activity by government which started with the ANSTO Act and has now been proliferated by these regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the Federal Government: how many times are we going to see Ministers come into this place with regulations which will simply exempt their own statutory corporations and business enterprises from laws that everybody else must comply with? I think the Opposition should be very concerned about this development. It should be very concerned that the power of the States to legislate in areas of their responsibility is being overridden by a government that is arrogant enough to think that it does not need to comply with laws that everybody else must comply with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would ask the Opposition to look very seriously at what is happening here. It should ask the Government when will it stop; when will it end? Or does the Opposition itself plan simply to legislate over the States in order to push through its programs when it gets into government?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that note, I would once again plead with the Opposition to recognise and understand what is happening here. We are seeing an ongoing erosion of the legislative functions of the States. This is happening without consultation. The fact that all of the State governments have joined in an action in the High Court to prevent the Federal Government from doing this is indicative of the concern that they have about the Federal Government's attempt simply to exempt the FAC from laws which would otherwise apply to its activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have therefore moved that these regulations be disallowed. They are an attempt to place the FAC outside the law, and they disregard State legislation that is designed to protect the environment. These regulations will allow the FAC, with a policy of environmental carnage that will decimate local marine industries, to simply continue unabated in Sydney. These regulations are an underhand attempt to silence the voice of protest by concerned Australians. I call on the Senate to support my motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a great deal of respect for Senator Sowada. She has again today delivered to the Senate an articulate and comprehensive defence of her position. Unfortunately, I have to say that it is not a position with which the Government agrees. We ask the Senate not to be enjoined by her to defeat these regulations but indeed to support them, to carry them and to allow the third runway development in New South Wales at Mascot airport to go ahead.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do that for a whole host of reasons, the principal one being this: in looking at sensible airport planning in Australia, a decision has been made to develop a third runway at the Mascot airport, but not at any cost. If this is done, there should be sufficient environmental safeguards and protections to ensure that the local environment, particularly that of Botany Bay, can be reasonably protected in the circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an important development, and one which has a huge economic impact for Australia. Sydney is the major gateway to this continent for all overseas travel. The facilities at Mascot can be upgraded at reasonable cost to ensure improved safety standards above the very high safety standards that already operate for that airport. In that way, the most reasonable outcome for the community can be achieved. That is a sensible planning-project development-air traffic management option. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we do not do these things simply because all those criteria are satisfied; we as a government have a serious and demonstrated concern about the environmental impact of development. We have conducted an EIS&mdash;an environmental impact statement&mdash;to see what the impact of developing a third runway at Mascot will be. Having said that, the environmental impact statement has returned a finding which enables us to proceed to develop that third runway with confidence and a huge degree of security based on scientific research and understanding. The environmental impact will be minimal, and the dangers forecast by those who oppose this development are not real. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This debate ought to be brought into this context at the beginning: almost every major development in this country that is of significant economic proportions has some impact on the environment in some way. In a community that is concerned about environmental values, and rightly, questions get raised about the competing values in terms of the environment and the development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case, the circumstances can be fairly described as these: a group of people, mostly Sydney residents, are, in many cases for understandable reasons, opposed to the development of the third runway. Without being trite, those reasons are the NIMBY reasons&mdash;the not in my backyard reasons, or the do it somewhere else but do not do it here approach. Stemming from that motive, a whole array of oppositions have been argued. The Federal Government has considered those arguments and decided that, in all the circumstances, the best way to proceed is by extending that third runway at Mascot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are supported in that belief by the New South Wales Government. I point out in passing that we are a Labor government, it is a Liberal government and we are both of the same view on this issue. From the point of view of what is the most sensible development, we can claim a majority position between us. In managerial terms, this is a most sensible position. Nonetheless, citizens and local government authorities are mounting a legal action to prevent the third runway from going ahead. In those circumstances, any argument that can be used as an obstruction is seized upon, thrown up and then used to try to block development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of the environmental arguments, with the greatest of respect to those who have propounded them, ought to be approached from that point of view. Their arguments are being utilised as convenient arguments, not necessarily to deal with the problems they are alleged to stem from but to prevent the development of the project at all. In saying that, I do not want to be uncharitable; I am sure that there are a number of people who have raised the environmental arguments out of serious and conscientious concern for the environment. Those people who have done that would raise those arguments anyway because, in the main, they believe that almost any development has an adverse impact&mdash;as I have said, every development has some impact of some sort&mdash;and that those developments should be set aside. We do not have that view. We recognise their view; we respect their right to hold it. We disagree and, being a government, we intend to implement our governmental authority in these circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument is centring around the question of whether or not an appropriate environmental clearance has been made. That argument has particular force because there are three levels of government in this country&mdash;national, State and local. We have conducted a Federal environmental impact study considering all of the issues. The argument now being raised is that it should have been a State one because there are conflicting areas of authority between the Commonwealth and the State; Botany Bay is a State jurisdiction, so it should have been a State EIS. Doubtless, if that argument fails, as may be the case, there will be contending arguments that there was some local government involvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this argument is about in one respect is twisting on the horns of the dilemma of the three levels of government who has the authority and which is the right governmental agency to make these decisions. It is exactly because of those reasons that the Commonwealth conducted its environmental impact study in close collaboration with the New South Wales Government. The plan that springs from that study exceeds or matches State standards in every respect. Mostly it exceeds all of the State standards; it never goes below any of the State standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The environmental impact statement&mdash;I speak as a former Minister for Resources and someone with some knowledge of these things&mdash;was one of the most comprehensive ever conducted in Australia for a major project. We are a government that is proud of its green credentials and its environmental position. We do not want to lose that pride by shoddy workmanship. We set very high standards for this environmental impact statement. It has matched very high standards. It is one of the most comprehensive ever. The statement has dealt with coastal hydrodynamics, the effect of the development on the tide flows in and out of Botany Bay, the impact on water quality within the area, and&mdash;the question raised by Senator Sowada in her address&mdash;the issue of the disturbance of sediments, including heavy metals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those matters have been scientifically studied, analysed and reported on. Conclusions have been reached about them which do not justify what I might, with respect, call the alarmist view that there are serious concerns about the spread of heavy metals. The findings do not support that alarmist presentation. We have looked at the potential damage to the seagrass beds in Botany Bay and made evaluations. We have looked at&mdash;this was a matter raised by Senator Sowada&mdash;the impact on fish species and other marine fauna and organisms. The conclusions&mdash;these are not conclusions by government or by politicians acting out of political expediency; these are the conclusions of the scientists who have made the study, so to that extent they have to be seen as scientific&mdash;are that, with safeguards, it is reasonable to proceed with the development of this runway. When all the evidence is in, as it now is, I think we are bound to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one other point that I should make. This is a Federal Government development. Why would Federal Government law not be applied? The Federal Airports Corporation is an agency of the Federal Government charged with the responsibility of commercially managing airports in this country and doing it in an appropriate way with regard to safety and the general environment, including the level of noise and sound and proper operational practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While one environmental impact statement has been made&mdash;not one by each government&mdash;it has been made in cooperation with the State Government and is more comprehensive than would have been the case if it had been done at a State level. It folded in to its survey the State concerns as raised by the duly recognised authorities. The conclusion is that the runway can proceed with the proper safeguards. The proposal for development is consistent with those findings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In those circumstances we would be in contempt of our responsibility if we did not then proceed. It is hard to escape a conclusion that the reason why some of these matters are being raised now is to delay the process, making the project less economic and causing a consideration of having to do other things as stopgaps. The eternal reality remains that Sydney is the gateway to Australia for most international flights. There is an obligation to ensure that the airports can accommodate that traffic. The best and most reasonable way of doing it is by developing a third runway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That leads me to the horrific crash in Amsterdam. The issue that is being raised by Senator Sowada is that, by concentrating airport movements over Sydney at Mascot close to or in part of the metropolitan area, we will risk in Sydney an Amsterdam type crash. I do not want to take from the Dutch in any way their proud record of air safety. But Australia's record of air safety is better than or at least equal to any in the world. We do not need to doff our hats to anyone when it comes to the level of air safety in Australia. So we have a very proud record to stand by, a record enforced by very competent technical people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the truth, in any case, about Mascot? The third runway will enable more take-offs over Botany Bay, a non-residential area, than over the residential areas of Sydney. The recommendations are that there will be 86 per cent more take-offs and landings over Botany Bay than there would have been without the third runway. That is a pretty impressive change. It means fewer aircraft over residential areas and a lessening of the risk. If there is an air mishap, in such grievous circumstances it is more likely that it would be over the sea in Botany Bay than over a metropolitan area in Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, from the point of view of the Amsterdam argument, the best way of preventing an Amsterdam type crash is to develop a third runway. It is certainly not to withhold the development of a third runway. The likelihood of a crash in a densely populated metropolitan area will be less with the option of a  third runway than it would be without it. I think that is an important consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are perhaps a number of other points I should make, but in general terms the major issues here have been summarised. It is fair to say that the Federal Airports Corporation's regulations established a licensing regime to ensure that contractors working on the third runway construction site and dredging sites in Botany Bay are required to comply with the findings of the EIS. They are required by law to do that. That enforces those standards and ensures that the work will be done properly with due regard to the sensitive environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, those standards are a direct outcome of the extensive environmental assessment of the third runway project and they include measures for preventing and mitigating any adverse environmental impact effects as set out in the environmental impact statement itself, as set out in the recommendations made by my colleague Ros Kelly, the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories, and as set out in the Botany Bay environmental management plan stage 1. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also note that the consortium engaged by the Federal Airports Corporation to undertake the runway construction project, that is to say, the managing contractor, is also required to observe strict environmental standards under the terms and conditions of that contract. The contract has been let, writing into the contract those standards as requirements for performance. The environmental standards demanded of the contractors working on this project, as I said before, are at least equal to and, in many cases, exceed the requirements that would apply under the State laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Botany Bay environmental management plan stage 1 was developed by a steering committee comprising the Federal Airports Corporation and the New South Wales Department of Planning&mdash;joint Federal-State cooperation. A key feature of the plan is a range of specialist environmental studies that were undertaken which provide baseline data to assist in the development of strategies to manage any environmental impacts during the construction phase and in the longer term. The study of the third runway represents one of the most comprehensive undertaken. It deals with all of those matters that I have referred to. It deals with a broad range of issues, including a thorough and extensive examination of the environmental effects of dredging sand from Botany Bay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because the environmental impact statement on the third runway was prepared in accordance with Federal environmental assessment legislation, not State legislation, the Federal Airports Corporation's regulations are also intended to remove any doubt about the extent to which New South Wales laws apply to the construction of the runway. The draft environmental impact statement provided a statement on the relationship between the Commonwealth and New South Wales environmental assessment processes. It summed up the position by stating that the State legislation would not apply to the construction of the proposed runway on Commonwealth or Federal Airports Corporation land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Airports Corporation's intention was to implement measures to ensure the project remained under the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth legislation only where clearly stated in the supplement to the EIS. Therefore, it is not sustainable to say there has been an attempt to conceal these plans. Some have claimed that these plans have been concealed; that is not a sustainable allegation. Furthermore, the measures were discussed with and subsequently endorsed by senior New South Wales Government officials before being implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is little doubt that the environmental impact statement would have adequately met the technical requirements applicable to an EIS prepared under New South Wales legislation. The New South Wales Department of Planning was consulted by Ros Kelly's Department, DASET, in the drafting of the guidelines for the preparation of the EIS, and there was extensive consultation with New South Wales departments and agencies during the draft EIS review process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third runway project has already been subject to one of the most thorough environmental impact assessments ever undertaken in Australia. The FAC has complied with all the assessment requirements of the Commonwealth Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974. To submit the project to further delay for further environmental assessment would simply be a negative approach to this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask that the Senate allow the regulations to stand and that this important development, which will facilitate aircraft safety and movement in Australia&mdash;particularly in Sydney&mdash;and be a sensible development, conducted in a way that meets proper environmental standards, be allowed to go forward. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A few minutes ago the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) made reference to the possibility that Senator Sowada's motion was simply another delaying tactic in what has effectively been a very long saga. That was my concern as well. There has been an extraordinarily long gestation period for this airport. It goes back to 1983 when the Hawke Government cancelled the coalition plans to commence construction of a third runway at Kingsford-Smith Airport. Then six years passed and we had the Hawke Government announcement in March 1989 that:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the economically rational option is to build a third runway at Kingsford-Smith Airport, subject to an environmental impact statement, and proceed with the development of Badgerys Creek but not on a fast track basis.</PARA>
<PARA>Then, on 20 September 1990, we had a draft environmental impact statement released for public comment. On 18 January 1991, 1,897 submissions were passed to the Federal Airports Corporation for consideration. Then, also in September 1991, a supplement to the draft environmental impact statement was presented. In November 1991, the Government finally announced approval for that third runway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not need to canvass that environmental impact statement in great detail. The Minister gave it a fair amount of consideration in his speech and broadly I would agree with most of the things he said about it. Looking at the question of dredging, which has been a major issue under debate, the Commonwealth has moved to give the Federal Airports Corporation the right to dredge for the runway without having to comply with the environmental assessment processes of the New South Wales Environmental Planning and Assessment Act. But, as the Minister said just a minute ago, the draft EIS said that the New South Wales Environmental Planning and Assessment Act of 1979 does not apply to the proposed construction of a third runway on Commonwealth or FAC land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There seem to have been submissions which suggested that this was not correct, but in fact it is the case that the Commonwealth has, if you like, the right to overrule the State laws. But, in fact, that is not the way it has turned out anyway. The dredging issues were considered in part E of the supplement to the draft environmental impact statement which, as I say, was released nearly 12 months ago. That part included consideration of the fill requirements, the on-shore sand sources and the impact on Botany Bay, including the coastal hydrodynamics of Botany Bay. It looked at the potential erosion of the foreshores as a result of changes to wave climate caused by dredging and runway construction. It looked at the marine ecology of Botany Bay. The Minister mentioned fish, but it included references to the impact on water quality, sediments and seagrasses as well as fish, and it looked at dredging generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just how much more in the way of such studies do the Democrats demand? Perhaps they will not be satisfied no matter what happens. Let us look at the provision being developed for the environmental management plan. It is to be implemented by the Federal Airports Corporation and the relevant State agencies. For instance, it says in appendix C:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Environmental Management Plan will be developed and implemented jointly by the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) and relevant State agencies. The FAC is committed to the mitigation of such environmental impacts on Botany Bay as are determined to be attributable to the construction and operation of the Third Runway at Sydney Airport.</PARA>
<PARA>It could not be much clearer than that. It says further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The objectives of the environmental management plan are to project, restore and enhance, as appropriate, the environmental qualities of Botany Bay (especially the water quality and the aquatic and terrestrial habitats for flora and fauna in and around the bay) in relation to any adverse impacts of the Third Runway.</PARA>
<PARA>So all of these things&mdash;the environmental impact statement and the processes that went into the consultations and submissions, and the establishment of the mechanisms for the development of an environmental management plan, its objectives and the way it is to operate&mdash;still do not satisfy the Democrats. Once again, they are finding that their principles are flexible to the extent that, while they are not normally concerned about such parochial matters as States rights, they suddenly discover that State rights are an important issue to flog in relation to this airport&mdash;despite the fact that the New South Wales Government is keenly and actively contributing to the establishment of a third runway and is very keen to see it happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One has to look at some political issues. As I have said, what more do the Democrats want and why do they want it? How satisfied would they be if another mechanism was introduced? Just why are they trying to delay this vital project? One just has to wonder at their motives. They seem insistent on joining Labor's troglodytes in their opposition to the third runway. In saying that I am referring to such people as Messrs McLeay, Punch, Brereton and Baldwin, and also to the Minister for Consumer Affairs, Ms McHugh, all of whom have seen it to be in their personal political interests to oppose that runway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that this third runway must proceed. It is not that the Opposition&mdash;or even the Government for that matter, to give it credit&mdash;has been unwilling, unready or unprepared to listen to people's genuine concerns about that runway. But there are other considerations that apply, which I think perhaps the Democrats are not prepared to give credence to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The construction of that third runway at Kingsford-Smith Airport is the most important infrastructure decision of the Federal Government to date. Goodness knows, we in the Opposition have been very critical over a long time of the paralysis of this Government in developing major infrastructure projects. On this one, it may have taken nearly a decade but it finally got there. If the third runway is not built by 1995, Sydney will be unable to handle effectively any further increases in passengers, so the whole economy of Australia will suffer. Sydney Airport must expand to cope with the forecast growth in tourism. The third runway will reduce the forecast aircraft delays by 90 per cent by the year 2010. If nothing is done, those aircraft delays could cost airline operators $695m a year by the year 2010. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard hearts and violins today coming from the Democrats about aircraft safety. It seemed to be quite a convenient moment to refer to aircraft accidents. Perhaps they are not prepared to acknowledge, as the Minister has just done, that aircraft safety will be enhanced by a third runway at Kingsford-Smith Airport. There will be a lessening of the risk with that third runway, as indeed there will be with a new airport at Badgerys Creek, which we are pushing strongly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impact on tourism is not to be neglected. These are important issues which the Democrats are not prepared to address. The increased capacity of that airport will create 40,000 new jobs in New South Wales, at a time when we have nearly one million unemployed. Surely that is a major consideration for us all. In addition, there is the contribution by international visitors in badly needed increased spending in our country. Peter O'Clery, the chief executive of the Australian Tourism Industry Association, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Failure to proceed with the runway will cause increased congestion to the point where by 1995 flights will have to be diverted regularly from Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not wish to delay the Senate longer. I sum up by saying that the coalition's position is basically that the third runway should commence immediately because of the demands of the aviation industry, the need for growth in tourism, and the safety requirements as well. Those aviation and tourism concerns are vital to the revival of Australia's economy and our country's future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also believe strongly that private enterprise should be permitted to begin construction at Badgerys Creek at the same time as the third runway at Kingsford-Smith Airport. We believe most sincerely that the environmental matters have been given thorough attention and that the regulations the Democrats would disallow will effectively require the Federal Airports Corporation to act in accordance with the State requirements. In fact, in the House of Representatives on 10 September, Mr Beazley said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indeed, if honourable members look at the schedule attached to the regulations, they will see a whole series of requirements upon the FAC to act in a manner that effectively conforms with the State law and also requires them to cooperate effectively with the various State authorities.</PARA>
<PARA>One would find that hard to believe if one had heard only Senator Sowada's speech. That is why the Opposition has not felt able to support the disallowance motion proposed by the Democrats. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating today the motion by Senator Sowada to disallow the regulations that would remove the requirement that the Federal Airports Corporation be subject to State law, specifically in relation to the proposed third runway development at Sydney Airport, a matter which Senator Sowada notes is also before the courts. It is not so much a question of whether State law should or should not apply but of whether the local people, through the recognised court system, have an opportunity to put their case fairly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very surprised to hear the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) argue in relation to an increase in safety, a matter that has just been taken up by the Opposition spokesperson on this matter. Senator Sowada earlier pointed out that the estimate is that the risk would actually increase as a consequence of the increased number of flights. I was also surprised to hear Senator Cook talk about taking off over Botany Bay. I think he would know that in the Amsterdam crash the aircraft took off quite successfully and circled around and was in the process of attempting to re-land when the accident occurred and it crashed into that building. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was also rather surprised to hear Senator Cook dismiss the figures given by Senator Sowada of the risk of 100 deaths per million population. As Minister for Industrial Relations and certainly as somebody formerly in the trade union movement, he would know that in occupational health, when people are exposed to hazardous substances such as carcinogens, the recognised standards are between one in a million and 10 in a million, or one in 100,000. That is the recognised standard. In that situation, the worker who goes into that potentially hazardous occupation understands that there is a risk involved. He also understands that there is some benefit in being exposed to that one in a million or one in 100,000 risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of the risk in relation to air crashes over Sydney, most of those people who are exposed get no benefit whatsoever. They are simply people who will be arbitrarily under a flight path when an aircraft is in difficulties. Under those circumstances, I think the figure Senator Sowada quoted of 100 per million, or roughly one in 10,000, is somewhere between 10 and 100 times higher than would be expected in occupational health. In those circumstances, I find Senator Cook's acceptance rather strange. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I want to pick up is that last night Senator Kemp, who seems to be the Opposition Minister for Democrat bashing, chose to talk about the number of occasions on which the Democrats have voted with Labor and compare that with the number of times we have voted with the Opposition.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If it is done properly with the normal checks and balances one would expect in a civilised society, the answer to that question is no, there are no obstacles. It is passing strange, I might say, that Mr Howard, in talking to ACOSS, has tried to hold himself out to be the friend of families by talking about family flexibility in working hours, because the Opposition joined with those among the employer organisations at the time this Government supported unions in the parental leave case to introduce the very flexibility into the system that Mr Howard is claiming now he will introduce should he ever have the unlikely possibility of coming to power in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The flexibility exists now, and the flexibility exists through the system now because of dicta laid down in a landmark case in the Commission two years ago, which the Opposition was opposed to at the time. But let me illustrate that that is not just a simple matter of fact; it is a simple matter of practical usage by a number of respectable employer organisations in Australia at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, the National Australia Bank and the Australia and New Zealand Bank have both developed agreements which allow workers, in consultations with their supervisors, to choose any combination of working hours that they want provided that they work at least 38 hours per week in the case of the National Australia Bank and 152 hours per month in the case of the ANZ&mdash;great flexibility. I referred to that in this chamber in terms of how, under our workers and family responsibilities commitments, we have encouraged employers and unions to blend family needs with working life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Sheraton Towers agreement has folded ordinary time earnings and penalty rates into one annual salary for all workers regardless of the hours worked. The Coles supermarket agreement, which covers some 35,000 workers in Australia, provides wage increases for workers in return for greater flexibility in working hours and reductions in night shift penalty rates, which are allowing many supermarkets to open on a 24-hour basis. Coles wants to be open all hours. It has concluded a workplace agreement enabling hours flexibility with its work force in order to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Workers at Southern Cross machinery have agreed to arrange their working hours so that they receive the one weekly salary by working less than 38 hours per week in the winter down time and around 42.5 hours per week when work picks up in the summer. Those are good examples to illustrate that the flexibility which Mr Howard proposes to deliver is there and is being utilised by Australian companies across the board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does this establish? It establishes that Mr Howard has a vested interest in running around this country misleading Australians into believing our system is inflexible, that it does not have the flexibility necessary and that he will somehow have the elixir of flexibility when a quiet revolution has been undergone in the Australian workplace in which those flexibilities are being utilised to the benefit of the people with the proper checks and balances necessary in a civilised society.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The issue has to be: who has policies to put Australians back in work soonest? In terms of that policy comparison, there is no argument. The accolade rests with this Government. The One Nation statement proposes to invest in public infrastructure development, which will be the linchpin or the locomotive for widespread economic growth in this country. The gains of that are starting to appear. That is one of the reasons why we are out of recession. The Budget which followed on from that, not to mention the youth summit initiatives which followed from that, ensures that we not only have a strategy for putting Australians back in work, but we have a strategy which is a responsible one for ensuring that those who are out of work, particularly the long term unemployed, have access to training to upgrade their skills to make them more relevant to the emerging economy.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to that interjection, there is indeed an international recession in Great Britain, Germany, the United States, Canada and Japan. That is why this particular result is so pleasing, because one of the depressed areas for some time has been international aviation. In the face of those results around the world, it is particularly pleasing that today Qantas has announced an after tax profit of $137m for the 1991-92 financial year. Most importantly, the airline group achieved a pre-tax profit before abnormal items of $103m compared with a loss of $158m the previous year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This major turnaround has been achieved largely as a result of significant cost reductions and increased productivity resulting from the major restructuring of the airline group. The performance by Qantas is also commendable, given that it was achieved against a background of a highly competitive operating environment which was significantly affected by depressed international trading conditions. Most other international carriers have recorded major operating losses over the past year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am aware of figures supplied by the airlines to the Department of Transport and Communications outlining that Australian international air traffic continued to grow in 1991-92. The Australian international scheduled airline passenger market grew by 7.2 per cent in 1991-92. Although the result cannot be directly compared with ICAO traffic reports, it can be noted that the latest ICAO estimate for 1991 indicated an overall decline in passenger traffic of 3.5 per cent on the previous year. Therefore, Australia's growth performance is even more creditable when viewed against this background.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the decade ending June 1992, international traffic to and from Australia grew at an average annual rate of 7.8 per cent. This compares more than favourably with a total world compound growth rate of 4.9 per cent and shows that Australia continues to be a popular world tourist destination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These results will be further enhanced by the international aviation initiatives announced by the Government, including multiple designation of Australian carriers and the benefits of a strong combined Qantas-Australian airline.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did see that article, although I do not have it with me, a week or so ago. I admit that I was a little surprised about it because I would have thought that in the Australian community there had been a considerable change in the attitude to what is euphemistically called domestic violence but which is nothing less than criminal assault, usually within the home or the household. The growing recognition that one is talking about a criminal assault has led to quite a different attitude by the police and courts so far as intervention in those circumstances is concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>

The magistrates courts in those jurisdictions could enforce that protection order.

Thanks to the women's refuge movement in particular, which 20 years ago inaugurated the protection of women who were subjected to domestic violence, there has been a growing awareness in the community that we are talking about criminal assault of a particularly vicious kind, quite often a hidden kind.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Attorney-General. I refer him to Mr Justice Toohey's reported statement that the High Court could construct a bill of rights based on `fundamental common law liberties'. I ask the Minister: does he agree, firstly, that the High Court has the role to interpret and protect the Australian Constitution and subsequent legislation enacted under that Constitution and, secondly, that it is the responsibility of Parliament to ensure that individual liberties are enshrined in law and to balance the freedom of the individual with the rights of others and the well-being of the community as a whole?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find it quite remarkable&mdash;breathtaking, in fact&mdash;that a High Court justice should speak of fundamental common law liberties as though they were the foundation for the judgment the other day. In fact, that judgment was founded on representative government as being essential to our form of democracy, and that was never conferred by the common law judges. They never conferred a right to vote. As our colleagues from Singapore will well know, the old imperial common law judges never gave the right to vote to the people. It had to be fought for at every stage. This breathtaking idea that the High Court is on the side of common law enshrining of the right to representative government is absolute nonsense.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Catholics and dissenters know that they would not have a bar of it. The right to vote is not a common law right. The way in which the High Court constructed its judgment last week does not give any confidence that the common law judges have the capacity to protect the rights and liberties of the Australian people. That will fall to this Parliament. Admittedly, the High Court has had a very proper role. For example, when the conservative coalitions back in the 1950s tried to ban a particular political party and dissolve it, the High Court held that that was beyond the constitutional power of the Federal Parliament and Government. In fact, the people upheld that judgment in a referendum. But that was based on our Constitution, which was founded on referendums in the late 1890s and passed by the Imperial Parliament. It was nothing to do with the common law itself. If the workers in the 1890s had decided to go for class warfare instead of the parliamentary and arbitrary system to better their working conditions, the common law judges would not have given them any help either to secure their democratic rights.</PARA></TALK.START>

We have to analyse what the real situation is, and the Opposition can find no real succour in the comments of Mr Argus about the medium term fiscal outlook. If our tax cuts were too stimulatory, so would be the Opposition's. The Government does not believe its offered tax cuts would be excessively expansionary because, as I have said on a number of occasions, we are committed to returning the Budget to surplus in the medium term. That is why we introduced the changes to the fringe benefits tax regime and so on which were announced a couple of weeks ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Argus said that an expansionary policy was understandable in the present economic circumstances. Mr Argus was a willing contributor to the preparation of the One Nation statement, which did introduce stimulatory economic policies at that time&mdash;and I think he is right. He has a different view, by the way, from the other business leaders Senator Short quoted today at Question Time. Mr Argus had a slightly more bullish view about a recovery than them. Mr Argus's view of fiscal policy contrasts with that of Dr Hewson, who said that he wanted to take $6 billion or $7 billion out of the Budget and reduce the Budget stimulus by 2 per cent of GDP.

The story was given a bit of currying up this morning by referring to nuclear submarines. That has not been discussed one way or another.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>The letter of the Minister, I have to confess, is somewhat disappointing. The resolution of the Senate which was as a result of a motion moved by my colleague Senator Short, who of course has taken a very close interest in the welfare of Baltic peoples over a long period of time, was to protest the continuing presence of Russian troops in the three Baltic states&mdash;troops which are of course now regarded as occupying forces now that the three Baltic states have been accepted by the international community as independent sovereign states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a position that you, Mr Acting Deputy President, would know we held throughout the years of occupation by the Soviet Union and was in fact held by all Australian governments except the Whitlam Labor Government which reversed that policy for a period of time. Since the breakup of the Soviet Union and since the international community accepted the independence of the three Baltic states on a general basis, up to 200,000 Russian troops have remained. The exact number is somewhat in dispute, but it is certainly somewhere between 130,000 and 200,000. The Baltic peoples are deeply distressed by this continuing presence of Russian forces on their soil and have sought support from the international community in pressuring Russia to withdraw those forces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know there is difficulty for Russia in withdrawing in terms of providing housing and other material benefits for the grossly extended Soviet force, in particular the Russian force, but, nevertheless, that does not negate the very reasonable demand by sovereign nations that occupying forces or forces of former occupying powers still on that soil should leave. This Senate very reasonably expressed that demand also and requested that the Australian Government protest that continuing occupation to the Russians and join&mdash;I am not sure whether it said it specifically, but certainly that was the spirit&mdash;with other governments of like mind to apply that pressure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, the response of the Minister to that demand as evidenced by his letter today is disappointing. Nowhere in his reply does he say that the opinion of the Australian Government is that it is opposed to the presence of the Russian forces in the Baltic states. He does not in any place indicate that the Australian Government is prepared, either on its own behalf or in conjunction with others, to diplomatically apply pressure to Russia to withdraw those forces. He does not canvass the possibility of the international community looking for ways in which it might support Russia in the provision of housing for its forces upon withdrawal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that even the Baltic states themselves in their very difficult economic circumstances have said that they would try to look at ways in which they could help ease this financial burden. All the Minister really says is that the Australian Government is pleased that a timetable has been agreed with the Government of Lithuania for withdrawal over the next couple of years and that the Australian Government hopes that a similar agreement will be reached with Estonia and Latvia as well. That is not good enough. That is a reply that will disappoint the Baltic peoples in Australia. They deserve more from this Australian Government. One can think of many states in the world that have foreign soldiers on their soil, but of the Baltic states particularly when one takes into account the fact that they were forcibly occupied for so long. They deserve more from the international community and they deserve more of the Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope this reply was drafted by someone other than within the Minister's office. During the course of this debate the Minister might get up and in fact say that the Australian Government's policy is that these troops should be withdrawn forthwith from the Baltic states and that the Australian Government is willing, together with other Western and like minded nations, to apply what diplomatic force is open upon Russia to require that withdrawal as soon as absolutely possible. </PARA>

I do not mind in the slightest his getting up here and saying that he, the Opposition and members of the Australian Parliament are concerned about the continuation of the presence of Russian forces on Baltic states' soil. That concern is a concern that we share as I made perfectly clear in the text of this letter when we said that we hoped that similar agreements of the kind that had been reached with Lithuania would in fact prove achievable with the other states.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole point of the letter that I did the Senate the courtesy of sending to the President of the Senate was simply, as a point of information, to draw the Senate's attention to the fact that one particular state referred to in the motion had in fact the day before the motion was passed entered into an agreement which would, within a reasonable time frame, allow for the withdrawal of the troops in question from its soil. In the letter I could have drawn attention to the obduracy and the stupidity of Senator Short in not amending his motion properly in the way that he was advised he should on the morning that the thing went through. The motion makes several references to Lithuania which are not appropriate, given the reality of the particular agreement signed on 8 September. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Short could not get his amendment correct and the point of the motion was simply to clarify that particular matter for the benefit of the Senate. It is absolutely no justification for pretending in some way that the Opposition's position on this is holier than that of the Australian Government. The motion did not call upon me or the Government to take any particular diplomatic action. If it had, I would, of course, have been responsive to that in the terms of my reply. It simply expressed the views of the Senate on an issue in respect of which it was entirely legitimate to express views&mdash;views which the Australian Government shares. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just let me finish. It is no wonder that his Department is an absolute shambles because Senator Evans and his office are a disgrace. I gave notice of motion on Tuesday, 8 September 1992. I refer the Minister to page 529 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 8 September. The first part of the notice of motion I gave on that day stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) expresses its concern that, despite many efforts by the leaders of the nations of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania to reach agreement with the President of Russia (Mr Yeltsin) for the withdrawal of Russian forces from their soils, as promised by Mr Yeltsin at the meeting of the G7 nations in Munich on 12 July 1992, there has been no progress on the withdrawal;</PARA>
<PARA>Between giving that notice of motion and the motion being brought on the following day, there were announcements over the wires from Lithuania that, in fact, an agreement had been reached between Russia and Lithuania. To its credit, Senator Evans's office rang me on the morning of 9 September and said to me, `We have consulted with the Department on this and it has drawn to our attention the fact that overnight there appears to have been an agreement signed between Lithuania and Russia. Therefore, we suggest the following amendment to your notice of motion'. Senator Evans's office suggested, with words supplied by his Department, that my motion be preceded with the words that the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) whilst welcoming the news of the agreement reached between Russia and Lithuania, nevertheless expresses its concern. . .</PARA>
<PARA>I later inserted the word `virtually' in the first paragraph of the motion so that, instead of saying `there has been no progress on the withdrawal', it said `there has been virtually no progress on the withdrawal'. That amendment was cleared with Senator Evans's office and his office said that that was okay by the Department. On that basis, the Senate agreed to carry it as a formal motion on 9 September.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask Senator Evans for an apology for the mistake that he made in his remarks. He has implied that I did not take any notice of the agreement that had been signed between Russia and Lithuania. I did take notice of it; it had occurred in that 24-hour period. The wording of the resolution and the amendment that was made to that motion were words supplied to me by his office and his Department. How he could not know that is beyond my comprehension. As I have said before and as this chamber now knows par excellence, it simply reflects the fact that Senator Evans is not up with the game in terms of his Department and his portfolio responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans implied in his letter to the President that he was doing the Senate a courtesy&mdash;and it is a courtesy&mdash;in deigning to reply to the President. I would be absolutely amazed if he had shown the discourtesy that is implied in the opposite&mdash;namely, that he would not even have considered replying. Given that Senator Evans replied&mdash;and I welcome that&mdash;I find his response, as Senator Hill has said, very disappointing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion that this Senate passed, formally and unanimously, expressed concern that there had been virtually no progress on this matter whilst recognising the Lithuanian situation. There is no mention in Senator Evans's letter to the President acknowledging that concern. Weakly, he said in his response that he had an expression of concern because he says in the last sentence that the Government `hopes that similar accords are signed with Latvia and Estonia in the near future'. If that is a response to an expression of concern that is supposed to reflect what the Senate had felt about this matter&mdash;it felt strongly about it&mdash;then Senator Evans grew up in a different school of English language from that which I and my colleagues on this side of the chamber grew up in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The letter says nothing about the continuing situation. As I understand it, that situation is that there has been no further progress in terms of any form of agreement between the Russian Government on the one hand and Latvia and Estonia on the other. The letter also does not reflect the fact that, whilst the defence Ministers did sign an agreement between Russia and Lithuania on 8 September in Moscow, at that time it was also hoped that a similar agreement would be signed between President Yeltsin and President Landsbergis. A last minute hitch occurred, so that agreement was not signed and, as I understand it, has still not been signed. That is an important agreement because without it the defence Ministers' agreement is much weakened. Senator Evans's letter does not acknowledge any of those things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without taking up much more time, I very strongly endorse Senator Hill's words of disappointment in Senator Evans's response to this formal resolution of the Senate. I believe that Senator Evans has not dealt with the issues concerned. He has certainly not reflected in any way in his answer the concern that this Senate and many Australians, not just those of Baltic origin, feel about this matter. It has much wider implications than the situation simply between Russia and the Baltic nations, because it goes to the whole question of the presence of foreign troops on the soil of sovereign nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no reflection at all of any acknowledgment of that concern in Senator Evans's letter. I hope very much that the Government of Australia will be lending its good offices in whichever way it can, much more strongly than is indicated in his letter, to achieving the resolution of this matter in Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia and also doing what we can through our good offices to get a better basis for agreement between President Yeltsin and President Landsbergis. It is a matter of very real concern and it is something that the Government, as well as the Australian Parliament, should feel much more strongly about than the intent that is shown in Senator Evans's letter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I request from Senator Evans an apology for what appears to be a gross mistake he has made in that it appears that he has been looking at the wrong piece of paper. He has looked at the notice of motion of 8 September, not the motion that was passed on 9 September, because the motion that was passed on 9 September was amended to take into account exactly the wording that his office and his Department passed on to me and which I was happy to accept. </PARA>

The truth of the matter is very simply as follows: on the morning that the motion was scheduled for debate, 9 September, it is the case that my office rang Senator Short's office to draw his attention to the very substantial agreement that had been reached overnight going to the heart of his motion so far as Lithuania was concerned.

Subsequently, further communication was made by my office later that morning to Senator Short's office proposing that there be a deletion of the subsequent references to Lithuania, by which time I am told that Senator Short had already tabled the motion in the abbreviated amended form and it was too late.</PARA></TALK.START>

He amended it in a half-baked and incomplete fashion. Because the motion had been thus amended and because there were continued references to Lithuania, conveying the impression that there had been something less than substantial about the agreement that had been reached with Lithuania, I thought it appropriate under those circumstances to write to the President, not in any way referring to that exchange but simply for the record, making it clear that there was this very substantial agreement on the record signed by the Defence Ministers providing for the withdrawal of all forces from Vilnius by November this year and from the rest of Lithuania by 31 August next year. On the face of it, it was a perfectly reasonable thing to do and simply does not justify the criticism that has been directed towards me or the Government by Senator Hill and now Senator Short. </PARA>

Page 14 of that report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prima facie, the limitations which are to be imposed by the Bill amount to an interference with the freedom of expression. Such an interference would be considered a trespass on personal rights and liberties, as contemplated by principle 1(a)(i) of the Committee's terms of reference. However, the principle requires the Committee to examine legislation as to whether it trespasses unduly on personal rights and liberties.</PARA>

<PARA>Some might say this report has been a little long in finding its way into this chamber, but I think anyone who gets the opportunity to read it will see that the delay has done it no harm. The principal reason for the delay is that the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, at the time of receiving this term of reference, was devoting itself to the drugs in sport inquiry.

I do believe anyone with an interest in tourism would be well advised to read the report, in particular the detail under the headings of the points that I make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first point relates to the concern the Committee had about putting together the words `environment' and `tourism'. For many years, indeed until fairly recently, environment and tourism were at war with each other. People who spoke the language of environment seemed to regard tourism and all tourist developments as the enemy and vice versa.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is easy to report and it is certainly fair to report that that attitude has changed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;She did indeed and perhaps we should have called our report the title of her poem. I was tempted to at some stage, but in the end we were not persuaded by poetry. Senator Brownhill is quite right. Australia has been marketing itself as an overseas destination because of its environmental or landscape attractions. It is very important that the tourist industry, in developing opportunities for people to see and explore that countryside, that outback, does not in the process jeopardise or even damage that environment. That has been the case in times past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very comforting that our report was able to table a recognition of the changed language between those two groups, those parts of industry, in the Australian community. There has been a recognition that there is no point in killing the goose that lays the golden egg. Although we did not examine it in great detail, it was certainly brought to the Committee's attention that there is a need for tourism and the environment to work together&mdash;not only to cease to be at war, but to work together&mdash;in preserving the environment. Even if the tourism development at the outset is a very sympathetic development, the number of tourists that come to stay in an area and/or visit the surrounding areas still</PARA>
<PARA>may, by their very numbers, further damage the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen a number of examples, some of which we referred to in the report, where it is important to ration the number of tourists, either the total number or the number at any one time able to proceed to an area. This is certainly happening with the area around Uluru rock and in many other areas of the environment, not only in areas which in the past were called fragile environments but also in areas that are overrun by uncontrolled or unlimited numbers of tourists and which can become threatened and proceed to a fragile state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We thought it was very important to make the point that `environment' should include not only landscapes but very much the people living in the landscapes and to make recommendations about the importance of tourism developments to take account of the environment in consultation with the community but in particular to include that local community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taking evidence at Broome, we were told about the fairly dramatic impact of the increased population in Broome on the local community, a dimension that is not always developed in looking at the impact on tourism and environment. One important consideration, for example, is that the costs of everything rise with the increase in population in a tourist resort. The changing character of Broome is a very salutary lesson in some ways. The local population, white and Aboriginal, have had to come to terms with fairly significant increases in costs&mdash;the cost of living in particular. Further, some of the people, particularly the Aboriginal community, have had to deal with the changing landscape of their culture through the development of tourism in what was previously not a tourist resort. We urge in our report an understanding of the environment to include `the people' and `the local community'. </PARA>

If those beach resorts are turned into skyscraper-type holiday resorts, people visiting them do not experience the same kind of holiday at all; they do not enjoy the same kind of rest. We also met the concept of the anti-tourist tourist&mdash;someone who likes to be a tourist visiting places but who does not want to meet 5,000 other people also there at the same time. There is a very large appeal in our tourist industry for places to which people can go to be away from it all. If we want to go to a wilderness, the last thing we want to find is that it is overrun by other humans. The very word `wilderness' means that we expect to find few other people. I do not think most people mind finding sight and sound of other humans; not all of us want to be hermits. But the concept of the anti-tourist tourist I think is worthy of consideration and is reflected in the variety of tourist developments that we find around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would not like to leave the impression that environment and tourism refer only to such things as the Great Barrier Reef or Uluru&mdash;not at all. One of the exciting things about the Australian tourist industry is just how wide is the range and how geographically spread are the tourist resorts in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second main point I highlight is the issue of adequate statistics in the area of tourism. In trying to assess the impact of an industry or to set goals that we want measured to account for the impact of changes and developments in that area, it is very difficult if we do not have adequate baseline statistics, or at least an agreed set of statistics and figures. What is a bed for the purposes of being counted as a tourist bed? Most of us can describe what a bed is, but is this bed to be counted amongst tourist statistics or is it for local use and, therefore, not to be described as part of tourism?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is still much more debate to go on about what exactly constitutes tourist statistics, but we do now have the Bureau of Tourism Research and the Australian Bureau of Statistics; I think the ABS is producing the framework of guidelines for what constitute tourism statistics and how to collect them. It is very important that those principles be agreed to and that the collectors of the data&mdash;the small providers of beds, support services, restaurants, accommodation and so on&mdash;appreciate the way in which that data is being asked for and contribute to its collection, so that we begin to get consistent national data. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the Committee makes recommendations about the changed nature of the Foreign Investment Review Board. We agree to its continuing; we agree about the good work it does; but we feel that, if we really are serious about the Foreign Investment Review Board giving independent advice, that advice should proceed directly to the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) after being examined by the FIRB and not back through Treasury officials. We have made recommendations to that effect and to the effect that there would therefore be a requirement for some at least modest change in the structuring of the FIRB. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were interested to discover that the FIRB did not monitor the outcome or development of any of the projects to which it had given approval for foreign investment. We feel that that is not sufficient and that the Foreign Investment Review Board should at least have more than a we-read-the-newspapers-to-see-what-is-happening regard to monitoring massive investments in this country. Local communities are very concerned if a significant overseas development gets started but does not proceed, and there are any number of examples of that happening around the country. We feel that that is a matter of relevance and pertinence to the FIRB, and we have made recommendations along those lines too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the time frame that has been agreed today, I do not have the opportunity to canvass all the recommendations. In summary, I believe that this is a good report which is very timely. We now have a national tourist strategy in the process of being implemented. I think it is a credit to Australia that we can actually consider the concept of a national tourist strategy, although I have a suspicion that my colleague Senator Campbell may want to paraphrase those remarks of mine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an opportune time to have a report such as this which puts the tourist strategy in place, particularly in terms of the opportunities for jobs and growth in this area. Nowhere is there any report that tourism is a negative in terms of economics. I do not wish to canvass again the economic issues or changes to local communities, for example. In the limited framework of looking at it in terms of economics, from all accounts tourism seems to be a very significant plus. Export earnings from tourism for this country are larger than rural and mining earnings combined, something that is still not widely recognised by the Australian community. Certainly once known, it ought to focus our minds considerably on the importance of protecting the tourist industry and seeing that it is developed, but in a way that is consistent with other principles and policies of the Australian community, let alone of Government or Opposition policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are jobs in the tourist industry. Many of those jobs are smiled at and dismissed as menial, but they do not actually reflect what the tourist industry is built on. Many of the jobs, I am interested to note, are for women, and many of those women are employed in their own small businesses dealing with the day to day running of a profit-returning organisation offering a service to people. There are opportunities for increasingly diverse jobs within tourism, and I think it is important that in understanding the benefits of the industry we also understand the character of it. It is not just a bed-making industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had the pleasure of being in Russia&mdash;what used to be called the Soviet Union&mdash;a couple of years ago. There we were given immediate and real evidence of the failure of that country to have anything approaching a national transport strategy that could deliver food to the people. Sometimes I am inclined to worry about national strategies on the ground that they seem to be establishing a bureaucracy. When I came home I though about this in terms of a national tourist strategy. It is very much to Australia's credit that we can, firstly, have the skills and sophistication to define and consider a national tourist strategy; and, secondly, define and address the areas of considerable difficulty. It is a measure not only of our sophistication but also of our civility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that is something we need to reflect on. In and amongst the requirements of something like a national strategy&mdash;in this case, a national tourism strategy&mdash;we have areas of expertise, for example in the computing industry, that are going to provide us with even more export dollar opportunities from marketing those very skills of being able to implement a national strategy. So there is much about the tourist industry that is sophisticated, exciting, profitable, and good for Australia in the short as well as the longer term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If people have an interest in this area at all, I recommend that they look closely at this report. It is an update of the data and statistics in the whole industry. It also stresses the better way in which the environment and tourism can, must and are beginning to go together. It also points to some changes that might be very constructive in the area of the Foreign Investment Review Board behaviour. All of the recommendations are designed to preserve and develop the tourist industry in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank all of those officers in the secretariat who have assisted the Committee over the time in dealing with this report: Peter Grundy, Gay Stevenson, Derek Drinkwater, Christine McPaul, Laurie Swift, Angela Misic and the other officers in the very early stages before the drugs and sport reference intervened, including Mick McLean, Mary-Louise Willheim, Les Rymer, Kay Chee Lance, Doug Hynd and Rosie Jervis.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;May I at the outset, on behalf of the WA tourism industry and Broome in particular, just put one thing on the record to help with any misapprehension caused by Senator Crowley's comments about the rising costs in a place like Broome. I can assure all of those people who read this report or Senator Crowley's speech that, even though Broome is a long way away, it is a destination which people from Sydney and Melbourne can get to at a very reasonable price flying with Ansett. Once they get there, they will find that the cost of a beer or a meal at any of the very fine resorts, be it Lord McAlpine's Cable Beach Club, the Auski resort or many of the other resorts in Broome, is very reasonable. I thoroughly recommend it. I tell them not to be put off by Senator Crowley's, I am sure, well-meant reference to some of the implications of increasing tourism numbers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report on the Australian environment and tourism by the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts is a substantial document which has taken a number of years in its gestation and preparation. I join Senator Crowley in recommending to those people who have an interest in the tourism industry, and of course the environment, to read the report. Most Australians will have an interest in both of those topics because tourism has become so important to Australia's national economic advance. And the environment is a matter of deep concern to all of those who care for the future of this great land, described by Senator Brownhill's favourite poet, Dorothea Mackellar, as a very wide brown land. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, the West Coast Eagles did win it. I am reliably informed that they will probably travel to Broome for a bit of rest and recreation after their tremendous victory. I now turn to the topic of the minority report. Most of the majority report I agree with and on most things the Committee had a large degree of consensus. But there were a number of themes in it which I thought deserved some separate comment and recognition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They were, in summary: the whole role of the Commonwealth Government&mdash;a central government&mdash;in coordinating the tourism industry, the impact of the tourism industry on the environment and the broader environmental questions; the role of the Foreign Investment Review Board; and, lastly, the general concerns about the marketing of tourism and the role of the Federal Government in encouraging investment in tourism and the growth of the tourist industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that honourable senators and Senate standing committees do not immediately accept a reference in this Parliament and presume that the outcome of that inquiry should be to see whether or not the Commonwealth Government should get more involved. We should always be healthily sceptical about the role of a central government&mdash;one that is often located, particularly with respect to Queensland, Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia, so many miles away from the action or activity. We should always be healthily sceptical about the role that that government can play in successfully trying to change people's behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am a confirmed sceptic about the benefits of central government action in many things&mdash;particularly in environmental action and often in the area of promotion of industry and investment&mdash;in terms of whether or not a Commonwealth government can actually be a positive force. I have yet to be convinced, for example, that setting up an environmental protection authority at the Federal level will actually achieve the worthy aims of trying to protect the Australian environment. Many honourable senators will disagree with that, but it needs to be put on the record that setting out to solve a problem by creating a new bureaucracy has failed many times in the past. And I think setting up a central agency such as an environmental protection authority will not help the environment. I remain to be convinced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Centralising environmental control can also be dangerous because one of the negative aspects of doing this is that one will in practice smother some of the entrepreneurial work and some of the innovative work at the academic level, in the private sector and in the government sector in trying to create environmental best practice. If we have State governments, local authorities, small businesses, medium sized businesses and academics all around Australia working on achieving best environmental practice, we are likely to come up with a higher degree of success in achieving environmental outcomes than if we have bureaucratic control and political control centralised in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not to say that there is not an earnest and sensible need for more coordination and exchange or cross-pollination of ideas in matters relating to the environment and environmental protection. I am just a little sceptical about whether something like an environmental protection authority, based in Canberra under the control of the Federal Government, will achieve that end. That is one of the main reasons why I have put forward that view in the minority report attached to this report on the Australian environment and tourism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second main comment I wanted to make was on the Government's role in creating an investment environment where we maximise the opportunities for Australia in relation to tourism and particularly international tourism, which is growing in importance. I share Senator Crowley's view that the conflicts between environment and tourism which were commonplace 10 years ago have tended to be diminished and that the major obstacles to investment in tourism, in expanding our tourism infrastructure, are indeed created by governments at a number of levels. I will refer briefly to some of these. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rigidities in the labour market still make many of our tourism operations not as feasible as they could be and indeed inhibit the sort of service that we provide to international tourists. As Senator Crowley said, the sometimes seemingly menial jobs of changing beds, making cups of tea or coffee for people or serving them toast in the morning are not menial; they are absolutely vital to Australia's economic future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if the front-line troops in the Australian tourism industry happen to be fresh out of grade 10 at school, by serving a bit of toast and a cup of tea to an American or Japanese tourist they are absolutely vital to the future of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The investment environment we saw around Australia and at Magnetic Island with the stalled Magnetic Quays development&mdash;and I also believe that Senator Crowley, on her visit to Broome, saw evidence of a stalled project&mdash;was the victim of the monetary policies, the economic policies, of this Government, whereby it forced interest rates very high and ensured that both of those developments stalled in the middle of the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am honestly not trying to score cheap political points here. It is a lesson for all governments of both political persuasions. But here we have two blights on the environment of Australia not because of some mismatching of environmental and tourism objectives but because of the economic policies of a central government which forced the cost of money so high that the developers of these projects were just forced off the sites and were unable to continue. I am sure that, as the economic recovery gains momentum and people are able to re-finance these projects, Australia will be blessed with two new developments, at Magnetic Island and, of course, in Broome in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To add to that, Australia does, with increasing focus on international tourism, need more and more capital going into tourism infrastructure&mdash;be it hotels, be it resorts, be it roads, be it railways, or whatever. A recent decision, indeed, a Budget decision of this Government, has put another major brick wall in front of investment in tourism&mdash;that is, the decision by the Keating Labor Government, and I believe with the support of the Leader of the Government in this place, Senator Button, to tax limited partnerships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Limited partnerships are a structure available in Queensland, Western Australia, New South Wales, and lately Victoria, which allow people to invest money with little hope of reward in the medium term, but with tax advantages in the short term, and encourage people to invest in long term projects such as tourism projects which often have a long lead time to get a healthy economic return. The Government decided, I think very unwisely, to tax these limited partnerships, and I am reliably informed by people around Australia that this decision has halted dead in the water a number of proposals to develop tourism resorts, one which I know of in my home State of Western Australia. Again, a decision of the central government has limited the amount of capital which will flow into the tourism industry, which we all agree, on both sides of the chamber, and I believe also in the middle of the chamber, with the Democrats, is an industry which can be environmentally friendly and which can, of course, enhance Australia's economic outlook. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also wanted to touch on aviation policy. We have had a very controlled, regulated environment. I congratulate the Government on the deregulation that has occurred to date, but of course the deregulation in the air, the deregulation of international flights, naturally turn our focus to what happens when we get on the ground, which is an integral part of the tourism chain. I have already mentioned the school leavers who serve us toast and tea for breakfast. The airports are a crucial part of the tourism chain because the tourism experience starts when one gets on the plane in one's home port and finishes when one gets off the plane and gets home again. So every experience one has on the way through is crucial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia, of course, has highly regulated airports controlled by a central government monopoly. We must ask ourselves, when we compare some of the facilities around Australia with the international experience, whether or not we are developing the very best infrastructure in airports. Of course, the Opposition has made its policy quite clear on airports&mdash;that is, they should be owned and controlled by the private sector, allow private capital to flow into them and ensure that we develop them to make sure that Australia can keep up with the infrastructure requirements of the rapidly growing tourism market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the short time available to me, I want also to refer to the Foreign Investment Review Board decisions and recommendations made in the majority report. In one recommendation, the majority of the Committee recommended that the Foreign Investment Review Board analyse social impact statements which should be required by developers to look at the social impact of tourism development. We all share a view that the social impact of tourism is something that needs to be looked at and considered. However, it is very hard for me to come to terms with the concept of a body like the Foreign Investment Review Board having to take social impact into account when it is coming to a view on whether or not a foreign investor should invest in Australian tourism&mdash;or any other investment, for that matter. I would think that the social impact is something that needs to be considered by the local community, in particular, and that local councils and local democratic processes should perhaps have some say, not over the investment factor, but over the development approval itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, that brings me back to the point that if one moves tourism and environmental matters into the Federal sphere, through the national environment protection authority, one takes away that decision making from the grassroots level where people can have a direct say in what goes on in their local community. I think it was Dr Suzuki who said, `Think global and act local'. I am afraid that in Australia, we seem to keep thinking globally, not thinking too locally, but acting globally as well. The trouble with the environment is that, even though the environment is an intricate system of interconnected ecosystems, those ecosystems generally start right down at the ground with micro-organisms and build up into bigger ecosystems. They do, of course, in the long term become a massive global ecosystem, but the trouble usually starts down at the ground and the best people to control those problems are people in the local area who have a direct interest in living in a fine environment. I reiterate my scepticism about bureaucrats and politicians in Canberra being able to improve that environment, no matter how well intentioned they are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other factor about the Foreign Investment Review Board which is referred to in the minority report is an inconsistency whereby the majority report actually asks the Foreign Investment Review Board to include the pre-1986 reform requirement that net economic benefit be demonstrated. My view, formed after considerable hearings with the Foreign Investment Review Board representatives, was that it is impossible to get anyone to analyse, scientifically or arithmetically, whether a particular development will have a net positive impact for the Australian economy. There are so many variables involved that it is very hard to decide that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that the recommendation of the majority of the Committee in relation to that is actually inconsistent with another of its recommendations. I would recommend that the current position be maintained whereby the Investment Review Board just makes a decision based on whether or not the proposal will have any demonstrable negative impact which, of course, is easier to determine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think&mdash;Senator Crowley can correct me if I am wrong&mdash;that the FIRB was unable to tell us of any proposal to invest in Australian tourism that had actually been knocked back during recent years. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to the matter of the role of the Commonwealth Government, and the idea of the creation of an environment protection authority. I have made a recommendation in this report which I think is one of the most important ones&mdash;that is, to ensure that any legislation for the establishment of a national environment protection authority should be made available for public exposure and public comment for a period of at least six months prior to its being introduced in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very worried that in Australia at the moment the environmental agenda is being run by a small handful of people who often have their own agenda to push. I refer, for example, to the listing of World Heritage properties. There is a very good example at the moment with the Nullarbor. The environment Minister federally, the environment Minister in South Australia and the environment Minister in Western Australia agree that they should list the Nullarbor and are proceeding with some speed to list the Nullarbor on the World Heritage listing without any consultation whatsoever with the local community. At the moment, no-one knows exactly where that proposal is. All of the reports are in, but again, there has been no consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The environment protection authority and the process by which it is being set up is being controlled by a small handful of politicians and bureaucrats. What I suggest, in the interests of all Australians, so that they know what sort of national environment protection authority they will get, if indeed they want one, is to have a long period of exposure of the draft legislation to allow everyone to come to grips with the implications of setting up this new centralised controller of the environment. I think that it would be democratic, I think that it would help the environment debate and I think it would allow all levels of society to have some view on the way in which the environment of Australia is controlled in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we allow the environment protection authority to go down the path it is following at the moment, allow the legislation to be tabled in this place some time between now and Christmas, or whenever it suits the Federal Minister and her Department, allow for a quick debate in the House of Representatives and another debate here&mdash;and all of a sudden we will have this new authority&mdash;we may actually be taking a step backwards for Australia's environment. I urge all senators and, indeed, the people of Australia to support the idea of making this legislation available for public exposure for at least six months prior to tabling it here.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Tabling Speech</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report that I have just tabled is very much about the environment and tourism. It was not so very long ago as support for the environment grew, so did the tension between the environment and development lobbies which included tourism. Fortunately that attitude has changed. The tourism industry recognises that Australia's major environmental features like the Great Barrier Reef and Uluru Rock are significant drawcards and that it is in the industry's own interest to protect them. However, pressure on the environment will increase as a result of our rapidly expanding tourism industry. Therefore, it is vitally important to be able to identify these threats and ensure that we do not `kill the goose that lays the golden egg'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The extent of the economic potential of tourism is now widely known. Not only does income from inbound tourists exceed foreign earnings from wool and mineral ores, but growth projections suggest that numbers of inbound tourists will increase by up to three hundred percent over the course of this decade. On any assessment the Australian tourist industry will continue to play an increasing role in the future well being of the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Essentially this is very good news. Economic growth is most welcome in all industries. This is especially the case in labour intensive industries such as tourism. Given appropriate training, these jobs would be permanent and the employees would be part of a dynamic industry with excellent prospects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Senate inquiry into the Australian Tourist Industry has therefore been most timely and since December 1990 it has been able to draw on 103 submissions, 1475 pages of Hansard evidence as well as other sources of information to complete its report. The economic dimension of the tourism issue has been a priority concern of the Committee throughout its inspections, hearing and deliberations. The Committee heard from peak authorities of the industry (such as the Australian Tourist Industry Association) on this matter through to individual developers of tourism enterprises and the managers of such projects. There was real enthusiasm for the industry's prospects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Several questions were raised during the inquiry concerning obstacles to the industry's further development and ways in which those obstacles could be surmounted. The Committee heard about the need for the international marketing of Australian tourism to be better coordinated between the Commonwealth and the States, the need for environmental impact statements for tourism development applications to be assessed competently and expeditiously, and the need for tourism developments to be properly completed so that the environment is protected and any environmental damage during construction to be made good.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With regard to marketing, it was clear to the Committee that the Australian Tourist Commission has been performing a necessary function with competence and should continue. Nevertheless, there is concern about the appropriate role of the States and Territories in the international marketing of Australian tourism. That concern has resulted in coordinated efforts between some States and the recent announcement of the withdrawal of the Northern Territory Tourist Commission from its overseas offices. The Committee has taken this issue a step further with a recommendation that an investigation be carried out by the Tourist Ministers' Council to evaluate whether a rationalisation of overseas representation is required.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similarly, the Committee was advised that tourism developments need to be assessed competently and expeditiously. It is clear that local and State governments need access to competent advice for the environmental impact assessment of proposed projects. If this is done well it will ensure that developments are both environmentally benign and economically beneficial. It is notable that the National Tourism Strategy released by the Federal Government in June confirms that, through the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment, a cooperative approach will be sought to the management of environmental issues in tourism contexts. For its own part the Committee has expressed its concern that the definition of environment include people; and the Committee has recommended that social and cultural impact statements be prepared for all tourist developments. It is essential therefore that care must also be taken in major tourism developments not to disenfranchise local communities and encroach on their culture. Tourism developments must address any likely dislocation of members of the community including costs of living effects and possible adverse impact on cultural values.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The environment and tourism sectors are very much dependent on one another and they must continue to achieve `win-win' outcomes. The need for tourism developments to be properly completed was highlighted during the Committee's visit to Magnetic Island and inspection of the Magnetic Quay development. There a failed development has resulted in a devastated beach, disfigured headland and siltation on the Great Barrier Reef. These consequences can be deleterious to tourism. The situation on Magnetic Island is due, at least in part, to the fact that the developer went bankrupt. It is regrettable that there can be no guarantees about the economic soundness of developers, and insurance to make repairs to the environment in such circumstances is a difficult proposition&mdash;adequate repairs would entail the completion of the project to a certain level. Nevertheless, in this situation there are two steps that can be taken to deal with environmental degradation from tourist developments. The Committee has recommended, first, that projects likely to cause significant scarring only receive development approval conditional upon an undertaking to renovate the area. Second, the Committee recommends that before tourism developments are approved, provision be made for community consultation including with the involvement of local government where appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee addressed problems of this kind that provide difficulties for the further development of the tourist industry; those difficulties need to be overcome. In addition, the Committee's inquiry revealed three significant areas in which changes of an administrative nature will greatly benefit Australian tourism. These are the report's most important findings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, tourism worldwide depends on the availability of a sufficient range of unique sites and features as well as quality facilities including hotels and restaurants. Increasingly, it is also depending on accessible natural sites that are both beautiful and interesting. For an extended period up until late last decade, however, there was a need for the tourism industry to acknowledge the significance for it of the Australian environment and take coordinated steps towards its preservation. This situation was remedied with the publication in mid-1990 by the Australian Tourism Industry Association of its <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Code of Environmental Practice</EMPHASIS> followed by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Environmental Guidelines for Tourist Developments</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee was particularly pleased to note these initiatives on the part of the tourism industry. And close scrutiny of these documents revealed their soundness in appreciation of the environment and its protection. The Committee endorses the ATIA's documents from that perspective. The implementation of the Code and Guidelines could ensure that many of the more regrettable mistakes in tourism developments in Australia will not be repeated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second area of change that could significantly benefit tourism concerns foreign investment. The Committee found that there is general agreement that foreign capital is welcome if not necessary for the development and support of the Australian tourist industry. This agreement extends from the Commonwealth Government and the States to the Bureau of Tourism Research and the tourism industry. One of the Committee's most important findings was that the operation of the Foreign Investment Review Board, the authority charged with advising the Treasurer on foreign investment proposals, needs to be reformed. The Committee found that the FIRB process for recommending approval of foreign investment has not been fully independent. Further, the FIRB has not comprehensively monitored projects that have been approved. And the FIRB needs to acknowledge the full scope of its responsibilities under the Impact of Proposals Act with regard to the social impact of developments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to address these problems the Committee has proposed a number of recommendation relating to the structure and method of operation of the FIRB. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The third major finding of the Committee's inquiry concerns the need for accurate and comprehensive statistics about the industry to assist development planning. The Committee's task of inquiring into the Australian tourist industry was complicated by the fact that statistics on the industry are not collected and presented uniformly and comprehensively. Since the Committee inquiry began, however, some significant steps have been taken to address the inadequate state of tourism industry statistics. In June 1991 the Australian Bureau of Statistics released its <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Framework for the Collection and Publication of Tourism Statistics</EMPHASIS>. It remains for the collectors of the data to provide the data in accordance with the formula.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In concluding my remarks, I believe that the Australian Landscape is one of our greatest assets. Valued appropriately and managed properly, it can become the centrepiece of our rapidly developing Tourism Industry. Our report has endeavoured to draw together the major issues associated with the development and proper management of a long term, sustainable industry. The recommendations we have made, we believe, will go a long way to ensuring that the tourism sector continues to expand and develop into one of our key industry sectors, providing wealth and employment opportunities well into the twenty first century.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly to this report in view of some remarks which Senator Campbell has just made. I find it passing strange that earlier today when giving notices of motion both Senators Campbell and Panizza strongly supported mining in a national park, namely, the Karijini National Park in the Pilbara in Western Australia, despite the fact that there are more than adequate supplies for hundreds of years of iron ore outside the national park and despite the fact that the pebble mouse, which is on the threatened species list, is within the national park and that the most important site for that animal lies within that national park area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For Senator Campbell to be arguing that the local population should do battle with the large forces of some of the mining interests and try to deny the Federal Government some role in setting environmental standards again I find somewhat strange. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Campbell also mentioned the Magnetic Quays development and laid the failure of that development at the foot of the Federal Government in relation to its economic policies. It seems to me quite clear that what happened in that case was that inadequate attention was given to the economic viability of the proposer of that development. Inadequate conditions were written in, in that the developer was supposed to have taken out an insurance policy so that if there was an economic failure or bankruptcy of that development company provision was made for the restoration of the area. Neither was that provision insisted upon nor was the provision that was written in acted upon before the date of expiry in relation to Magnetic Quays. There was a failure of the environmental protection process in relation to the Magnetic Quays development, and that is what has led to very serious damage to the environment in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to pick up the point made by Senator Crowley that there are really two extremes in the tourism industry. There is the beer, brothels and casino type of tourism industry that one sees well exemplified on the Gold Coast with the glitz, glamour and the high cost type of holidays. That is one type of tourism. The other extreme is tourism which one can only associate with wilderness and which, as Senator Crowley pointed out, is necessarily associated with very low population density&mdash;in fact, very often so low that one needs to be completely alone in those locations to enjoy the wilderness experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first type of tourism depends particularly on sight&mdash;going quickly to an area and having a look at something&mdash;and the other type depends very much on a full range of experiences such as sound, touch, smell and aloneness with a natural environment. That latter type of tourism is very much in danger of being lost in Australia, yet Australia is one of the last countries in the world where one can have a wilderness experience. Within the next few decades wilderness will probably disappear from the face of this planet, with the exception of a few places in Australia where it can still be experienced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While there is not a large immediate profit to be made from wilderness tourism&mdash;indeed, it is the most rapidly growing area of tourism&mdash;over hundreds of years the integrated economic return to be made from that type of activity, leaving aside the very important cultural and experiential aspects, is very great indeed. We need to recognise the great importance of hanging on to those wilderness areas and maintaining very low population densities so that people can continue for many future generations to experience wilderness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last week I was down in northern Tasmania in an area which has come to be known as the Tarkine, an area of temperate rainforest, where quite clearly the number of people who could go into that area and experience it at first hand would be very small at any given time. There are very few examples left in the world of temperate rainforest. In terms of the integrity of the central area, the area is still very much intact with very little human intrusion and one which really should be incorporated into the World Heritage area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings me back to what Senator Campbell was saying, that these sorts of areas do need Federal activity to ensure that they are protected. By their very nature, these areas have very low population densities and do not have people who might raise a case for or against tourism. These areas, which share characteristics right across Australia, need Federal Government intervention to ensure that they are properly protected and that there are comprehensive conditions laid down for their protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That also brings in the matter of threatened species. Over many years we have been expecting Federal legislation to protect threatened species. It has been promised for at least seven years, to my knowledge. We are still to see that legislation. We understand the legislation which is in the process of being argued by several Federal Ministers is likely to be significantly watered down; yet this is an area, in contradistinction to what Senator Campbell said, which demands Federal comprehensive legislation across the whole of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly the application of that legislation needs to be administered through some local knowledge, and that needs to be fed into the system. But without that comprehensive Federal legislation it will simply fail to protect threatened species. We will fail to protect the wilderness experience, of which Australia is one of the last refuges in this world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply add on the plea that that other end of tourism, the low population density end of tourism&mdash;that which offers the wilderness experience where one puts a pack on one's back, walks for several days and sees very few other human beings&mdash;is the sort of tourism that Australia can continue to offer for a very long time into the future provided we look after it; yet I believe it is in danger of disappearing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to briefly finish off the remarks I started before lunch. We were discussing the motion by Senator Sowada to disallow the regulations of the Federal Airports Corporation, specifically those not requiring them to observe State environmental protection laws in relation to environmental impact studies and the third runway in Sydney.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I was making was that the figures Senator Sowada had presented indicated that the risk to the people of Sydney of that third airway were way above the acceptable levels of risk in an industrial capacity. In this capacity one is dealing with a general population which in the main stands to gain nothing in particular from the expansion of that airport whereas in an industrial situation the worker at least expects to get some employment from the exposure to potentially dangerous situations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also made the point that the recent crash in Amsterdam did not involve a plane immediately after take-off&mdash;the plane was in fact attempting to return to the airport when it crashed&mdash;and the claim made by Senator Cook in relation to take-offs over Botany Bay was largely irrelevant to that situation. Almost certainly, a plane losing two engines and attempting to return would be circling over either an area of population or, perhaps even more dangerously, over some of the chemical storage facilities or some of the petroleum dumps and refining facilities which surround Botany Bay. So the risks are really quite considerable and, as Senator Sowada has pointed out, some of those aspects were not taken into account in relation to the Federal environmental impact statement procedure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last night, Senator Kemp, who I believe is the shadow Minister for Democrat bashing, was analysing the number of times the Democrats had voted with either the Opposition or the Government. Quite clearly, in this particular case, which we see as a very important issue, the Democrats will call a division and the Government and the Opposition will vote together. According to Senator Kemp's own figures, there were 97 occasions on which the Democrats raised amendments and very important points when the Opposition and the Government voted together.

However, there are a number of points I would like to address in response to the issues raised by honourable senators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to a couple of points raised by Senator Newman, the Australian Democrats certainly do agree with her point that Sydney does need increased airport capacity. I do not think anyone with half a brain would disagree that that is necessary. We support any move to increase that capacity. However, we do not believe that the third runway is the way to go. We support the fast tracking of Badgerys Creek and one would be very hard pressed to find anyone in Sydney who opposes the Badgerys Creek airport. In fact, the western Sydney regional councils have requested of the Federal Government that the development be fast tracked and speeded up so it can come on stream much sooner than its current completion date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bankstown airport is a very important existing facility for light aircraft. It has been suggested on many occasions that the smooth running of Mascot airport would be assisted by moving many of the smaller aircraft at Kingsford-Smith to Bankstown. I understand that Richmond Air Force base will slowly be changed from military use to civilian use. We could possibly see many of the cargo flights that currently go into Mascot move to Richmond. Even Williamtown airport in Newcastle has a very important role to play in developing wide ranging airport services in the Sydney region. So it is not just a matter of Kingsford-Smith. There are many options. We believe&mdash;and this has been suggested by a number of people&mdash;that even better management at Kingsford-Smith would result in a better flow of air traffic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Newman accused us of listening to troglodytes. I hope that she was not referring to the very sincere local community groups and local residents who have voiced their concern about the third runway. I hope that she does not use the word `troglodytes' when she is referring to those lobby groups who come to see her when they have an issue of concern. I certainly hope that she would perhaps give the members of the Atomic Ex-Servicemen's Association a better hearing than they got when they came to see her about their claim for compensation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Newman referred to a range of issues that she believes were adequately addressed by the EIS. It may well be her opinion that those issues were addressed, but there are a lot of people who believe that those issues were not adequately addressed by the environmental impact statement. That matter is now before the courts and it should be decided there. If that environmental impact statement has adequately met all the concerns and has addressed all the issues, the FAC should have nothing to fear from the courts scrutinising that document and coming up with a judgment in its favour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ours is not a delaying tactic, as has been claimed by the Opposition and, I suggest, by the Government. In fact, the Opposition should be desperately concerned about the processes at work here. One of the main reasons I have raised this issue in the Senate is that, once again, the Federal Government is using the processes of this chamber and the Parliament to ride roughshod over local communities and the States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A matter of great concern was raised here in relation to the ANSTO Amendment Bill. The Government was successful in respect of the issue of radioactive waste at Lucas Heights. Thanks to the actions of this Government, we now have a situation where the management of radioactive waste by ANSTO is not covered by any State planning environment law anywhere in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are seeing once again is the Federal Government riding roughshod over the States, believing that it can take matters into its own hands when it does not like what is presented to it by way of State legislation. We believe it is very important that this principle be opposed. To that extent, we have pleaded with the Opposition to defend vigorously, as it has in the past, the rights of the States. It should once again recognise that this is a very arrogant move on the part of the Government. The Government has not consulted anyone. The State governments have found the Government's actions so offensive that they have joined in an action in the High Court. In fact, I am amazed at the Opposition's response in this matter. Where are the defenders of States rights? The Opposition is the group in this Parliament that will continue vigorously to defend States rights. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Disability Discrimination Bill 1992. I begin by reminding the Senate of speeches made in relation to this Bill in the House of Representatives on 19 August of this year. My shadow Ministry representative, Mr Bruce Scott, led the debate for the Federal coalition and was followed by the Liberal MP Mr Russell Broadbent, who spoke of his extensive work in the disability field. Another Liberal member of parliament, Mr John Bradford, told the House:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Community attitudes to the disabled vary enormously. Generally I believe that most people support the principle, and so they should, that disabled people should not be discriminated against. I think many people would go further and suggest that if there is to be discrimination, it should be in favour of those who are disabled.</PARA>
<PARA>The Labor member for Kalgoorlie, Mr Graeme Campbell, took an arm's length position when he called the Bill `a heyday for the social engineers' and expressed frustration with its aims. While his views may be extreme, they do reflect widespread scepticism in the community about the so-called politics of difference and the need to legislate for social change. Mr Campbell's colleague the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services, Mr Gary Johns, tried to make up lost ground for the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to remind honourable senators of the words of Minister Howe in May this year when he told the House of Representatives that the Bill `represents a landmark in receiving human rights for all Australians'. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government has a long term commitment to achieving a better deal for people with disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister then invited interested parties to comment on the legislation over the winter recess. Several months later the Minister and his Bill are now under fire from such respected groups as the Australian Medical Association and the Australian Association of Surgeons. Both associations have expressed concern about the expanded definition of the term `disability' and the rights of health professionals when dealing with HIV positive patients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even groups representing people with disabilities have hit out at the Bill, labelling it as discriminatory and a mockery of the very essence of the reasons for the Bill. Letters and faxes expressing concern about this Bill have poured into my office over recent months. I have brought a number of the submissions to the attention of the Minister's office. However, the Minister remains unconcerned and unmoved. I am appalled that there is not one backbench Labor member listed to speak in the debate in this chamber today. I am surprised that Senator Zakharov and Senator West, who have normally been champions in this area for many constituencies, are not speaking and we are to hear only from the Minister in charge of the Bill, in summary&mdash;in a similar way to the way the issue was dealt with by the Parliamentary Secretary, and probably with the same briefing notes that Mr Johns used in the House of Representatives in August. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, the Federal coalition is seeking to obtain details of all submissions made to the Government so that the concerns raised in them may be properly addressed. We have asked for a full list of people and groups who have made submissions. I remind you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that it was Minister Howe who publicly invited community organisations and groups to make submissions on this legislation to the Attorney-General's Department. I have been informed that the Attorney-General's Department has been precluded from making available the numbers of people who made submissions, the list of names and the comprehensive issues raised. I have been provided only with a summary of the main issues that have been addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to ask: why is the Government refusing to disclose the numbers of submissions and the details as requested? Back in August the Federal coalition was so concerned about the Government's lack of cooperation that we asked the House of Representatives to refer this very important Bill to a joint select committee for proper parliamentary scrutiny. Our second reading amendment, moved in the House of Representatives, read in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that . . . a Joint Select Committee, to be known as the Joint Select Committee on the Disability Discrimination Bill 1992 . . . be appointed to inquire into and report . . . on the following matters:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)a general assessment of the outcomes of the proposed legislation in relation both to persons with disabilities and others in the community, including:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a)the appropriateness of exemptions included in the Bill, particularly for the telecommunications industry and the deaf community and whether further exemptions should be included, for example, for the Australian Defence Force;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b)whether the Bill deals satisfactorily with significant issues of health policy and whether these could be dealt with more appropriately in separate legislation;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c)the appropriateness of the definition of `disability', including an examination of existing definitions of disability in the UN Declaration of the Rights of Disabled Persons and/or State legislation, the reasons why the proposed definition is different and whether it should include, for example, cognitive and neurological dysfunctions;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(d)the need to clarify provisions relating to `unjustifiable hardship' and `action plans';</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(e)the interrelationship of the legislation with existing legislative provisions such as the `compulsory conference' procedure and the procedures in existing racial and sex discrimination legislation; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)whether the mechanisms contained in the Bill are the most appropriate means of reducing disadvantages experienced by people with disabilities, including a detailed examination of the costs of the proposed legislation to industry and taxpayers and of the practicalities of its implementation.</PARA>
<PARA>Our amendment was rejected. Various peak bodies have made representations to me, as well as to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs, and they are the tip of the iceberg in relation to concerns about the Bill. For example, the Confederation of Australian Industry strongly opposed the legislation, saying that employment decisions should be taken on the grounds of merit. The Law Institute of Victoria questioned why the burden of proof in disproving the exemption of unjustifiable hardship rested with the complainant. The Multiple Sclerosis Society of Victoria highlighted the ambiguity of `unjustifiable hardship' and the lack of action plan monitoring. The Senate's own Scrutiny of Bills Committee found that the legislation failed to set out the qualities and attributes needed for a person appointed to preside over a compulsory conference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reading the representations, I find a common concern relates to exemptions, particularly the proposed three-year exemption for the telecommunications industry. The Royal South Australian Deaf Society went as far as describing the Bill as discriminatory and, as such, not acceptable to the deaf community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The definition of `disability' covers physical, sensory, cognitive, neurological, intellectual and psychiatric impairment, mental illness or disorder and the presence in the body of organisms causing or capable of causing disease. It is worth noting that cognitive and neurological impairment were not included in the original explanatory memorandum. The Liberal and the National Federal coalition took up the issue with the Government in the House of Representatives in August. I am pleased that it has finally agreed to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Controversy continues to surround the definition of `disability' and the fact that it includes `the presence in the body of organisms capable of causing disease'. I received a barrage of criticism about this definition. The Australian Medical Association rightly pointed out that virtually all Australians carry organisms in their body capable of causing disease. The need to protect personal or private health was also raised in the AMA submission as well as the need for a special exemption to cover the health professions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, the Australian Association of Surgeons expressed concern that the Bill would make it illegal for a surgeon to refuse to perform an elective procedure on a known HIV positive patient. While acknowledging that the Bill was laudable in concept, the Association felt that its implications have not been thought through, particularly in regard to the medical profession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost of establishing the Office of the Disability Discrimination Commissioner, funding public education programs, support agencies, additional staffing and legal aid is also contentious. The explanatory memorandum provided to the House of Representatives predicted that this cost would be $5.5m in the first year. Yet the memorandum now provided to the Senate forecasts just $2.3m. The reason for this massive $3.2m discrepancy lies in the Federal Budget Papers. Far from delivering the expected $5.5m, the Federal Government came up with only $1.553m in the first year, $1.032m in 1993-94 and $0.761m recurrently. Such evidence exposes the rhetoric of this Federal Labor Government and again calls into question its much publicised bona fides. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the principles of this Bill. The legislation is complaints based and provides for the establishment of an office of the Disability Discrimination Commissioner who will be part of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The Commissioner will try to conciliate complaints but, where that process is unsuccessful, the Commission can inquire into complaints and make determinations. The determinations, which are not binding on the parties, but enforceable in the Federal Court, include remedial action and payment of compensation. The legislation specifies that damage can cover injury to a complainant's feelings or for humiliation that the person might suffer. The Federal Human Rights Commissioner, Mr Brian Burdekin, illustrates this point with the case of a Tasmanian footballer banned from playing because he was HIV positive. Speaking on ABC radio on 17 July this year, he said that the footballer could soon have recourse to new anti-discrimination law and demand compensation from the local league. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also provides that only reasonable accommodation needs to be made for people with disabilities. Persons against whom complaints are made can argue that the accommodation necessarily involves unjustifiable hardship. Similarly, an employer can argue that a person with a disability is unable to carry out the inherent requirement of the job. The Bill provides for the introduction of disability standards should the Government and relevant parties decide that they are necessary. The standards relate to employment, education, accommodation, provision of public transport services and facilities and the administration of Commonwealth laws and programs. Service providers also have an opportunity to lodge action plans with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission outlining long term strategies to overcome perceived discriminatory practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation exempts charities, the telecommunications industry for three years, pensions and allowances, migration, combat duties and peacekeeping services by the Australian Defence Force and peacekeeping services by the Australian Federal Police. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission may also grant temporary exemptions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Originally, this Bill defined `de facto spouse' as a person living with another person `on a bona fide domestic basis, although not legally married, whether or not they are of the same sex'. The definition broke new ground because it extended the definition of `de facto spouse' to homosexual couples for the first time. Last month the House of Representatives amended the legislation by deleting the definition of `de facto spouse' and defining `associate' as a spouse, a person living with another person on a genuine domestic basis, relative, carer or a person in a business, sporting or recreational relationship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, too few of the Federal coalition's concerns have been addressed by the Government. In fact, the Minister's Parliamentary Secretary gave a less than convincing response on 19 August. We believe the issues raised in the submissions sent to us and in some of those that I have since seen sent to the Senate Committee are fundamental and deserve thorough consideration by the Senate Committee. I am pleased to note that that Committee will be meeting this coming Friday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The funding discrepancies outlined earlier must be pursued to ensure that the Government is not creating false expectations, then dashing hopes through Budget shortfalls. Similarly, we have asked for a full list of all of the issues identified in the submission sent to the Attorney-General's Department and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission which the Minister for Community Services himself invited. Why should any of those issues be withheld? I can certainly understand that some of the names might be withheld on the basis of privacy, but there should be no withholding whatsoever of any of the details or the issue. What hypocrisy&mdash;inviting the major players to request and suggest amendments to the legislation, and then filing their suggestions in the bottom drawer. They had better be available to the Senate Committee in full detail on Friday. Exactly how many submissions is the Government hiding and what details are not being disclosed? Until the Senate Committee sees this full list of suggested amendments and the Government's reasons for rejecting them, the Minister makes a mockery of the parliamentary process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The objects of this Disability Discrimination Bill are highly commendable. I recall reading a 1990 speech by the United States President, George Bush, in which he told the National Leadership Coalition on Aids:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Washington&mdash;President Bush called on the U.S. House of Representatives to pass a law that would ban discrimination against persons infected with the AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) virus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He told the National Leadership Coalition on AIDS meeting March 29, "We're in a fight against a disease&mdash;not a fight against people. And we won't tolerate discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation the president referred to is the Americans with Disabilities Act, which has been passed by the Senate and is now pending before two House committees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The president said he was encouraged that the projected AIDS infection rate will not be as high as estimated a year ago. He said that the effort to combat AIDS includes research into a class of virus that might cause not only AIDS, but also such other diseases as muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis and at least two forms of leukemia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following is the text of the president's remarks:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am delighted, and I really mean that, to be here with you today, the leaders who guide American business as it helps those suffering with HIV and AIDS. You make our hearts glad, and you make your country proud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other generations have faced life threatening medical crises, from polio to the plague, and this virus is our challenge&mdash;not a challenge we sought, not a challenge we chose&mdash;but today, our responsibility is clear: We must meet the challenge, we must beat this virus, for whether talking about a nation or an individual, character is measured not by our tragedies but by our response to those tragedies. And for those who are living with HIV and AIDS, our response is clear. They deserve our compassion, they deserve our care, and they deserve more than a chance, they deserve a cure. America will accept nothing less. We are slashing red tape, accelerating schedules, boosting research, and somewhere out there, there is a Nobel prize and the gratitude of planet Earth waiting for the man or woman who discovers the answer that's eluded everyone else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We pray that that day will come soon, but until that day, until this virus can be defeated by science, there is a battle to be waged by society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because in 1990, the most effective weapon in our arsenal against AIDS is not just medication, but also education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our goal is to turn irrational fear into rational acts. And every American must learn what AIDS is and what AIDS is not. And they must learn now.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The transmission of HIV is as simple as it is deadly. In most cases, it's determined not by what you are, but by what you do and by what you fail to do.</PARA>

And we were impressed by the determination of the people there&mdash;the doctors, researchers, nurses, health care workers&mdash;and especially the brave people who are living with HIV. We learned a lot about caring, a lot about family, a lot about hope, and we saw the face of humanity in the face of AIDS. And you, too, are in a powerful, unique position to influence the response to HIV and AIDS. Washing our hands of it won't help solve the problem, rolling up our sleeves will.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The roster of participants at this conference is an honour roll.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">And our 10,000 million dollar war on drugs is also a war on AIDS.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">America has the most sophisticated health care system in the world, but it is not without its problems. We face many challenges, our system depends on private insurance and individual payments, as well as government programs. AIDS magnifies these challenges, including the challenge of expanding access, bringing costs under control and overcoming obstacles to quality care. With these concerns in mind, I asked Dr. Louis Sullivan to lead a Cabinet-level review of health care in the 1990s, and businesses like those you represent must play a major role in helping to improve our health care system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The crisis is not over. We report tens of thousands of new cases every year, and many predict we can expect to continue to do so in this decade and even into the next century.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. I remind honourable senators that Minister Howe told the House of Representatives that this legislation was an effective means of overcoming the most significant barrier facing people with disabilities in this country&mdash;the attitudinal barrier. I believe that the Bill in its present form will not overcome that barrier. This Bill has been referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs for consideration after this second reading debate in the hope that the many submissions and issues finally receive proper scrutiny.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I begin to look at the substance of the Disability Discrimination Bill 1992, I make an observation about the time it has actually taken to get to this Bill this week. We are now well into Wednesday afternoon and this is the first piece of legislation that this chamber has been able to deal with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Disability Discrimination Bill does represent a very positive and significant step forward for Australians with disabilities. Though we do share many of the concerns that have already been expressed and we do have major reservations about this piece of legislation, the Democrats will be supporting the Bill. We congratulate the Government on finally acting to put in place at least some Federal disability discrimination legislation. I make the point here that virtually all States already have some form of disability discrimination legislation, with the exception of Tasmania. I note that the ACT has such legislation, but unfortunately the Northern Territory does not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Federal legislation is putting some national uniformity, some national standards, in place right across the entire country. It is picking up a number of issues that the State Bills cannot touch, such as the Commonwealth departments and instrumentalities on which the State legislation has no bearing. This legislation is also trying to come to grips with some of the problems between the various States' legislation. For example, in some States&mdash;New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia&mdash;there is no cover for people who have a psychiatric disability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike the Opposition, our concerns mainly relate to our belief that the Bill does not go far enough in protecting and advancing the rights of people with disabilities. We have discussed this legislation with a range of interested groups and individuals and virtually all of them in the disability area agree that this Bill is nowhere near as good as it could have been. But we understand the desire of people with disabilities, their friends, advocates, relatives and carers, to at least see the anti-discrimination mechanism established in this parliamentary session, rather than risk losing this legislation altogether. Therefore, the Democrats will be supporting the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite our reservations we have continually told those who have been in touch with us that, yes, we will support the legislation. Because despite their concerns&mdash;and very genuine concerns already discussed by Senator Tambling&mdash;not one disability group has asked us to do anything other than make sure this Bill gets through as quickly as possible and not to even let it lapse through until the end of December. That was one of the reasons that we decided we would agree to a referral only to the Senate Standing Committee and not see this Bill move off to a joint committee with the possibility that it could have taken months and months to actually put the Bill back before this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs will look at this Bill on Friday and hopefully will, in a very focused way, be able to examine some of the problems that have already been mentioned. It is certainly true that a good deal of dissatisfaction has been expressed and I stress again here that the Democrats certainly do not believe the legislation is perfect. But the general view coming through from the community is, `Despite the shortcomings of this legislation, let us see at least something passed'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no doubt there will be some problems to be ironed out in the future, but we cannot reasonably expect legislation such as this to swing into operation without any technical or practical difficulties. Similarly, it would be ridiculous to spend months and months to try to tighten legislation to the point that it is virtually set in concrete, a totally static, unbending law, never to be amended or never expecting any changes. That is simply not going to be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Minister has said, this legislation is to be a framework for change. Indeed, the Democrats see it as being not much more than a starting point, and I am sure changes will be required in the future. If we are going to successfully build upon this framework there will probably be, over the years, a number of changes and perhaps some full committee references to look at how exactly it is working in practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is crucial about this Bill is its very clear symbolic value. The mere existence of this legislation on the Federal statute books is an indication to Australians with disabilities of a national refusal to tolerate any discrimination against them. It is a signal to Australians with disabilities that, as a society, we value them and their contribution and we do not believe it is fair or just or acceptable to discriminate against them because of their disability. It is a signal I would hope Australians without disabilities would be very keen and very pleased to send. From that symbolic perspective, the Australian Democrats certainly welcome and support the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move on to look at some of the concerns that we do have. Some of the concerns expressed to us in letters and faxes reflect somewhat of a misunderstanding or a lack of knowledge of what exactly is in the Bill and what its purpose is. Some of them, unfortunately, are fairly blatant attempts by certain groups to avoid any obligations that might fall their way under the Bill. Some are very genuine and, indeed, the vast majority are very accurate observations about shortcomings, from minor to major, in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot has been said already about some of the cost implications and I do not believe these concerns are warranted. The organisations and individuals voicing them should really be looking more closely at two things: firstly, the intent of the Bill which is to look beyond people's disabilities and focus on what individuals can do, and what is realistic assistance to help them actually do that. In other words, it is about shifting attitudes. Secondly, they should be looking more closely at the potential of the Bill to provide employers with valuable employees. In relation to employment, we are basically talking about a pool of talent that, at the moment, is largely untapped, but a pool of talent that can be tapped with very little expense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Americans with Disabilities Act came into force in the United States, the business magazine <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Industry Week</EMPHASIS> had this to say to employers who were anxious about the impact of the Act on their businesses:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . employers are missing an opportunity to tap into a group of workers previously ignored except by the most enlightened employers who . . . have already begun using common sense, inexpensive workplace changes to employ workers with disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA>The trouble is that employers think it is going to cost a fortune to employ people with disabilities. If they look to the United States&mdash;and it is much stronger legislation there&mdash;it has not had any of those experiences and it has not had those problems. Indeed, the results from what is happening in the States are very enlightening indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The results generally show that compliance with disability discrimination legislation can be inexpensive and quite easy and there can be some really great pay-offs for employers who make that change. For example, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">US News and World Report</EMPHASIS> of July this year talks about a small business in Carolina where one-half of the firm's 18 employees have disabilities. Since employing people with disabilities&mdash;in this particular instance, mainly people with learning disabilities&mdash;the owner of the business has discovered that absenteeism has dropped, work performance is higher, productivity is up and accidents and carelessness on the factory floor are down. The report quotes the owner as saying, `Any manager who does not look first for a disabled person is leaving gold sitting on the back porch'. The owner goes on to say, `Employers are just afraid of taking the time to be a little bit creative'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key to this whole piece of legislation is to promote a more creative approach to employment and to encourage greater workplace flexibility and diversity. The Bill simply says that one cannot discriminate against people with disabilities when one is hiring, firing or promoting people or providing a service to them. It contains two general exemptions: firstly, where the action one would have to take in order to accommodate the person with a disability would impose unjustifiable hardship; and secondly, where the person with a disability is not able to perform the inherent requirements of the job or the position concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are sensible exemptions which make it quite clear that the Bill is not about forcing employers to take on people with disabilities regardless of their skills or abilities. It is not about taking away the right of employers to employ people on merit. It is not about forcing employers to incur unreasonable expenses or any unnecessary hardship in taking on employees with disabilities. It is not about quotas and it is not about affirmative action law. It is primarily about changing the attitudes of employers, co-workers and service providers towards people with disabilities&mdash;and I do not believe employers have any great cause to be anxious about the cost implications. Indeed, they need to be aware that from the opposite perspective many organisations representing people with disabilities are concerned that the notion of `unjustifiable hardship' is too vague and could be used by some as an easy way out where employers or business organisations are not interested in providing equal opportunities for disabled people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another side of the cost argument is the potentially significant community savings to be made by improving the rate of participation in employment among people with disabilities. When earlier this year I was looking at some of the data in this area I came across a speech to the New South Wales Chamber of Manufactures by IBM Australia executive, Mark Bagshaw. Mr Bagshaw has quadriplegia, has been with IBM for 13 years, and is the company's international marketing manager. About the costs of the argument, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But rather than look at the problem from just a cost point of view, I prefer to look at the numbers from a cost/benefit point of view. In other words, I believe we should also take into consideration the potential benefits to the community if these people were taxpayers making a valuable contribution to the country's gross national product, rather than recipients of government benefits. If this were done, the total benefit to the community of providing appropriate job opportunities for people with disabilities would, I suggest, go a long way towards addressing the expected balance of payments deficit.</PARA>
<PARA>As I think he is giving the right message to Australian employers, I will just quote him again at length. Later in this article he goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that employers have a responsibility to understand what disability is all about; to listen to people with disabilities to hear what they can and cannot do.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . .                 . . .                      . . .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think employers also have a responsibility to match a job to a person's ability rather than their disability. For example, I've been successful in my chosen career partly because the job is well matched to my physical ability. I could say that in a marketing management role I don't do anything; that's not quite true, but I certainly don't do much which requires physical dexterity. I'm therefore 100 per cent productive in the job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe employers have a responsibility to formulate a corporate policy on the employment of people with disabilities, and most importantly to put a plan in place to identify suitable positions and make them known to the disabled community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many employers adopt what I call a "passive acceptance" view of employing people with disabilities. If approached, they are likely to be reasonably open-minded about employing people with disabilities, but they mostly do little or nothing to communicate their willingness to listen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In return, employers have a right to expect that people with disabilities will put the effort in: to contribute to your business, to make the most of their skills and abilities&mdash;in other words, to provide you with the same return on investment as all your other employees.</PARA>
<PARA>Basically, Mr Bagshaw is saying to employers not to be afraid and that Australian businesses really need to do four things: firstly, employers should investigate their company's policy on employing people with disabilities and, if there is no policy, should set one up; secondly, employers should identify positions which would suit people with disabilities and, if necessary, seek help from disability organisations; thirdly, employers should understand what government assistance is available for employing people with disabilities; and, fourthly, employers should make their positions and policies known by writing to disability groups, by advertising and, when the job ads are actually placed, by making it very clear that they are an equal opportunity employer, and also by advising government departments. The result of all this, Mark Bagshaw says, is a clear classic win-win situation where everybody benefits&mdash;people with disabilities, the community and employers. This is the attitude that Australian business should be bringing to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another of the specific exemptions which has already been mentioned relates to Telecom, and this is of great concern to people with hearing disabilities. In a letter to the Attorney-General's Department, the Chief Executive of the South Australia Deaf Society, Damian Lacey, put the case against this exemption. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Deaf people and people with disabilities generally have received a most unsatisfactory level of provision in the past in this arena. Access to telecommunications is a major quality of life issue for people with disabilities in our technological society. We cannot accept that it is unreasonable for telecommunications to be required to meet the provisions of the Bill when other major service industries will be required to meet them.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . telecommunications access for deaf people and people with disabilities (is) critically important in our information age. Not only must we attempt to adjust the current inequities, but we must work to ensure that the potential of technological development does, in fact, improve the fit between the individual person with a disability and society.</PARA>
<PARA>The Consumers Telecommunications Network, representatives of which will appear before the Committee on Friday&mdash;it is a national coalition of organisations concerned with telecommunications issues&mdash;has been very outspoken on this issue as well, stating that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;the exemption contradicts the objects of this particular Bill;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;throws into question the Government's commitment to reducing the barriers for people with disabilities to ensure they are able to fully contribute to and participate in community life; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;threatens one of the main objects of the Telecommunications Act which is to ensure the standard telephone service is "reasonably accessible to all people in Australia on an equitable basis, wherever they reside or carry on business".</PARA>
<PARA>In its excellent submission on this Bill to the Committee, CTN made the critical point that telecommunications is now an essential service providing consumers not only with a cheap and effective means of transacting business and making appointments but also with a vital social network enabling individuals to create communities, maintain contact with family and friends, albeit across potentially vast geographic distances. For people with disabilities the value of a telephone is greatly magnified, and it becomes even more important if it is simply to contact friends and relatives, make doctors appointments or perhaps even in an emergency to ring an ambulance or the police. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the telecommunications providers really felt that they could not provide a particular service without incurring unreasonable costs, if they really felt that there was a major problem, they could rely on the unjustifiable hardship clause in the Bill. It is already there in the legislation, available to be used by any service provider. As several organisations and individuals have asked: if the framework is good enough for everyone to use, why has the telecommunications industry been singled out? Why is it more special than anybody else? Why is it different from, say, aviation, broadcasting, tourism or, indeed, the banking industry?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that the Americans With Disabilities Act recognises not only the social desirability of ensuring disabled people have access to telecommunications services but also the market potential of providing such services. The American Act contains a separate section specifically covering telecommunications which requires carriers to provide 24-hours-a-day, 365-days-a-year TTY facilities. So why has it proved impossible for the Australian Government to do something different here? Why is it impossible for it to do what the Americans have managed to do? We have asked questions of the Government and, as yet, really have not received a satisfactory response. I look forward to the Committee hearings on Friday when we will be asking a lot more questions on this specific issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other concerns we have about this legislation which I will quickly list. They relate to areas such as the operations of the Migration Act, the Australian Defence Force in relation to combat duties, peacekeeping services provided by the Australian Federal Police, and employment and accommodation in private households where the employer or provider of that accommodation actually lives. The view has been expressed to me that none of these areas is any different from the general situation of employers or other providers of goods and services and, as such, they should have no blanket exemption at all. I believe this view is correct, I support what these groups are saying, and I think that these exemptions certainly weaken the Bill itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another concern is the need to clarify which party bears the onus of proving or disproving unjustifiable hardship. Both the Villamanta Legal Service and the Law Institute of Victoria have raised this issue. They believe that the Bill needs to spell out very clearly where that burden of proof lies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the opinion of the Democrats it should rest on the respondent, that is, the parties seeking to claim unjustifiable hardship as the reason for exemption from the provisions of the legislation. And I ask the Minister whether the Government is planning any amendments to address this issue and to make it clear. If not, I am sure it will also be one of those issues raised at the committee hearing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other concerns have been expressed about this Bill and they include: the actual definition of disability, the problems around the complainant's choice of jurisdiction&mdash;will they actually look at the State laws in those States that have State legislation or Commonwealth legislation?&mdash;and the inadequate investigative powers of the Commissioner. However, as I have already indicated, these concerns will not stand in the way of this legislation passing through the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike the Opposition, which we suspect would like to see this Bill watered down or dropped out of sight altogether, the Democrats do not think this Bill goes far enough. It does not go far enough in enhancing and protecting the rights of people with disabilities, but at least it is a start. We believe that this legislation will at least have a significant effect on community attitudes. We believe that it will raise public awareness about the barriers confronting people with disabilities, in particular in the work force and other community activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to finish with a quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New Internationalist</EMPHASIS> magazine of July 1992. This is a story written by Vic Finkelstein, an English teacher of disability studies, and is set in a Third World country. And this is a final quote by the main character in this story:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Disability . . . isn't something that you have. It is something that happens when one group of people create barriers by designing the world only for their style of living.</PARA>

What we need is to build up the banks so that the river does not flood and to build bridges across the river so that we can meet, exchange experiences and create an environment where we can celebrate human differences.</PARA>
<PARA>Yes, this is a rather idealistic vision but it is the spirit with which we should be looking at this Bill. We should not be looking at it with suspicion, fear or with exaggerated claims about its consequences, but with optimism. We should take advantage of this opportunity to end discrimination against people with disabilities to the ultimate benefit of all of us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Disability Discrimination Bill which we are discussing this evening is outlined in the explanatory memorandum as providing for `national, uniform legislation to make unlawful discrimination against people with certain disabilities in certain circumstances'. If Senator Lees was talking just then about being idealistic, I suppose that in beginning my speech I could be accused of being idealistic because I have some regrets in rising to speak on this legislation. And my first regret is that we need this legislation at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It says something about our society that we have to in fact build the bridges that Senator Lees was talking about through legislation. In some ways it represents our failure, and I mean failure on all of our parts, failure of our institutions which are the agents for passing on our culture, our educational institutions, our schools and our families. It represents a failure on the part of community organisations, many of whom are doing a great deal to overcome the sorts of prejudices that have been shown towards people with disabilities. It represents a failure on the part of employers, the Government and the Public Service. I instance the very poor record that Public Service departments have in employing people with disabilities, and they of all ought to be leading by example. Legislation will not necessarily mean that they will do any better than they are doing now. What internally motivates people is the important thing rather than the external motivation of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, we ought to look at all the institutions, including the media. We ought also to examine ourselves, our organisations, educational institutions, families, employers, companies and government departments, and ask ourselves: what are we doing to break down those barriers that have been built up towards people with disabilities? Given that and given that the Government has put this legislation before us, and given that there is a sense that we may achieve something through legislation, then it ought to be that that legislation is approached in the most bipartisan or non-partisan way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My first regret is that we need this legislation at all. My second regret is the way in which this legislation has been handled. I thought that this would be one area in which we could take the politics out and have a non-partisan approach. When I first saw the legislation and read through it, I listed a large number of concerns. Without having looked at any of the submissions, I drew up a list of the concerns which I had, which I discussed with my staff member who was particularly looking at this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not claim to have a legal training. I do not claim to have the sort of experience that the organisations that have made submissions have, but with my untrained eye, my eye with an interest in people with disabilities, I saw a number of problems. It seemed that this legislation had been presented to the House of Representatives in a very ill-prepared form. The number of submissions that we have received and the number of submissions that the committee received illustrates just that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first reading of the Bill raised those problems and it also obviously raised many problems in the minds of others. The burden of my regret lies in the behaviour of Minister Howe and his handling of this legislation. In his second reading speech, the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) said that it was the introduction of:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a major piece of legislation on a matter which so deeply affects the lives and opportunities of people with disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA>His very opening paragraph outlines the importance that he appeared to be placing on this Bill. He described it as a piece of legislation that `deeply affects the lives and opportunities of people with disabilities'. Given that, I should have thought that it would have been more carefully thought through and also, again, that there would have been much more cooperation. But that is what the Minister said, and obviously from his behaviour it seems like it was rhetoric. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister said, again in his speech, that he was letting the Bill lie in the House over the winter recess so that `interested parties can make any further comments'. That is what he said in his second reading speech, and I think that is proper. I thought it might have been better when it was first tabled in the House of Representatives but, given that it was not all that good&mdash;and maybe that was some admission of that&mdash;the Minister was now saying that he would leave time for those submissions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) sent out a letter saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill was prepared after extensive consultation and more particularly takes into account many of the concerns that were raised by people as a result of the distribution of a discussion paper entitled `Disability Discrimination Legislation. An Outline of the Proposed Bill'.</PARA>
<PARA>I should have thought that, if the Government had really consulted extensively, we might not have had the number and types of submissions that we have had. Anyway, the Attorney-General tells us that the Government consulted extensively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister also went on in his second reading speech to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The introduction of this Bill is further evidence of the unwavering commitment of this Government to social justice for people with disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA>That is fine. But it would have been better if his rhetoric had matched his practice because if we were to believe the rhetoric then we should have seen that reflected in his behaviour. That is not so. Sadly, the Minister showed his real colours, and I suppose some people have already seen those in some of his visits to talk to people who run institutions which work with people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Tambling appropriately and reasonably asked for copies of the submissions made to the Government. Senator Tambling indicated there might have been some privacy issues, but, surely, the Minister could have asked the people who made the submissions, `Do you mind if we give them to the Opposition so it can examine them and we can work together to make this legislation the best it can be and also to ensure that it doesn't have any unintended consequences built into it that we regret later on?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Tambling asked and the answer was no. The Minister tells us that he has put it on the table so that it can be looked at over the winter recess. We asked for submissions and they are not available to us. It just makes the Minister's statement sound very hollow. I am not asking Senator Zakharov to agree, but it does make the Minister's statement sound very hollow when, on the one hand, he says, `We want as much consultation as we can get' then, on the other, he precludes this half of the Parliament and, I presume, the Democrats. I do not know whether Senator Lees asked for the submissions, but I would have thought that it might have been appropriate for the submissions to be forthcoming after consultation with those who made them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Tambling finally resorted to putting on notice a question to the Minister asking from whom he had asked comments. We got a summary of those comments. Senator Tambling approached a large number of organisations and I thank those people&mdash;and I am sure Senator Tambling has thanked them, too&mdash;for those very extensive and thoughtful submissions which have enabled us to examine this legislation more carefully. It would have been easier for them had the Minister given them to us so they did not have to do it all over again. They might question why their limited resources had to be used in that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We suggested that this Bill go to a joint committee and be examined in detail because we had so many concerns, but that was not to be, and it will go to a Senate committee. Let me say, for the information of people who happen to be listening to the broadcast or who may read about it, that this is a case which reflects very well on the new procedure that the Senate has adopted. After the last election, the Senate adopted a procedure of referring Bills where there was some concern to the appropriate Senate standing committee. Previously, when we had concerns like this, we would make a speech during the second reading debate, then we would go to the committee stage and sometimes that committee stage, as in the case of the Family Law Bill, would go on for four days in this chamber, on a Bill on which we all agreed. We went through four days of debate backwards and forwards across the chamber. To facilitate and to speed up that process, it was decided that Bills could be referred to a committee and that that sort of level of debate could go on in the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other benefits, of course, of the new procedure is that groups can put their case on the public record. Prior to that, it was the Government's interpretation of the groups' submissions and it was the Opposition's, the Democrats' and the Independents' interpretations of the submissions that were made to them, and it was often difficult for us to have evidence which was on the public record. On Friday, we will be seeing groups who have expressed their concerns about this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some of the groups; we will not have time to speak to them all. As I said, there are many concerns associated with this Bill and they should receive due consideration. In some ways, I do not believe that that Senate Committee has the time to go through them all which a committee would have had if it had been a full reference. I believe that this Bill is so important that it should have been a full reference to make sure that we do not have any other unintended consequences. That is especially so when a number of organisations which are specifically for people with disabilities have said that the Bill discriminates against people with disabilities. That is of great concern. Hopefully, we will be able to tease that out on Friday, but if we start at 9 o'clock and finish at 5 o'clock, it does not leave a great deal of time to consider a Bill which I think has a number of flaws and a number of problems. We will do our best, and I hope that it does not mean that we will have a Bill which we regret later on.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in support of the speedy passage of the Disability Discrimination Bill 1992. If all other senators were lobbied as effectively as I was, they would be aware that this legislation is regarded as an extremely important step in the empowerment and assistance of people with disabilities. I quote an extract from a letter received from Mr Robert Altamore, who summarises succinctly the reason why this legislation should receive support:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am a member of the Council of the National Federation of Blind Citizens of Australia. The experiences of our members suggest to us that Commonwealth discrimination legislation is necessary to address discrimination against people with disabilities in aspects of their everyday life such as education, employment, running a home, raising a family and enjoying entertainment and recreation. In particular, we believe that this legislation is necessary to&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Give people with disabilities equality before the Law wherever they <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">live in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>While I agree with Senator Patterson that internal motivation is far better than external motivation driven by legislation, and I commend her comments in this regard, nevertheless, in every case, legislation can be seen as an indication of a society's values or standards. On that basis, it would actually be a very strange omission and it would be very remiss of us, when we have set up a Human Rights Commission that has looked to the rights of many different groups within our community&mdash;it has tackled sexual discrimination, racial discrimination, and use of privacy in damaging ways&mdash;not actually to put in place disability discrimination legislation. So we can say that, while we would want to be far in advance of the legislation in our community action, nevertheless, we have a standard which shows our society's values. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, this legislation is not perfect and some of the inadequacies have been pointed out by others. There are several areas in which improvement can be made. Hopefully, the committee process will be useful in this regard. I seek to point out four problem areas that can be noted with suggestions for improvement. Firstly, a link could be made between this Bill and the Disability Services Act 1986 so that both pieces of legislation can be seen as complementary in their wording. I would like to ask the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) to respond to my suggestion that paragraph (iii) of the clause of the Bill headed `Objects', which refers to existing laws, could actually include reference to the specific legislation regarding disability services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I suggest that a lead-in time and an action plan could be tabled with the Human Rights Commission not only by service providers in a voluntary capacity, but also as part of the special and temporary exemptions or exceptions from this legislation that various groups may be seeking. I am thinking particularly of the three-year exemption for Telecom. An action plan within those three years I think would receive quite a degree of approval from people with disabilities who could benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, consultation with the public should be incorporated into the exemption procedure. When people are seeking either special and temporary exemptions, or even in relation to the general exemptions which are related here, the public are consulted. Fourthly, the legislation could have gone further and specifically required that all material relating to the regulation, promotion and implementation of the Act, and all proceedings under the Act, be freely available in formats which meet the needs of people with disabilities to assist the process of consultation. I note that for the first time a Bill has been translated into the alternative formats of brail and audio tape to allow for maximum consultation and input. I commend this action heartily. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, this legislation is not perfect. Nevertheless, it would be extremely damaging and counterproductive if the Committee process delayed or postponed the passage of this Bill. I would be more than happy to support the Bill now prior to its referral to the Committee process. I express concern on behalf of many people who value this legislation that it not get bogged down either now or in the committee stage. It is a start, a good start, and much better than the vacuum present up to now in terms of disability legislation. I think it would be very irresponsible to ignore this area and let it slip away. I am sure Opposition members feel they could improve on it and may be if they get their way in another election, they will be able to improve on it. However, I would like to support it now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week a young man from the Beni Abbes Community in Hobart died. He was a person with disability. He was respected by those who loved him, lived with him and cared for him. He was loved because of his uniqueness and because he had an intrinsic value, as each individual person has. He was respected and cared for because of that fact, but he had a lot to give. Those who had the eyes to see the gifts he had were the ones who benefited from his living in that community. His passing was a matter of deep grief for those with whom he lived and for those outside of that community who supported that community. Such people abound in this community. Yet, sadly enough, their talents and gifts are very much overlooked.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It all comes back to the questions that we mortals ask about why there is suffering and disability. Before we had to live for many years with the suffering, and in some cases death, of the one closest to us, we generally have the reasons for suffering all neatly worked out. It is all to do with free will. We are created with the gift of free will, otherwise we would be slaves. People make wrong choices and those wrong choices have consequences. Rulers decide to go to war and there are horrific consequences as a result. Aeroplane manufacturers make mistakes and do not fully understand metal fatigue, and there are terrible consequences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is famine, starvation and injustice in the world and almost always that comes down to man's inhumanity to man. There is a very sound argument to suggest that something did go awfully wrong at the beginning and we are suffering the consequences of that. I come back to the point that, before we ourselves face pain and the loss of one who is closest to us, the answer seemed simple. However, when faced with that pain, faced with that disability and faced with the daily effort of coping&mdash;and after we have gone through the cries of `why?'&mdash;then we begin to focus on the meaning of suffering and begin to seek what good can come out of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I am saying is nothing new. It has all been said before. For example, Job said it in the Bible. It is a most interesting and illuminating piece. After having survived all the dreadful things that befell him, Job was able to say that he had been holding forth on questions that he neither recognised nor understood and that before he knew God by hearsay and now, since God had journeyed with him through the loss and pain, he saw Him face to face. Indeed, from the Christian perspective it was Jesus himself who, by word and example, corrected the view that those with disabilities should be blamed for them, or their parents should be blamed for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, now we have come to the stage where we have to debate a Bill which in a way will require people to give acknowledgment to that very fact. If we were perfect there would be no need for this Bill, no need at all. Obviously, we have not been able to recognise the inherent value of persons with disabilities, their enormous talent and what they have to give. Better off dead, or least never been born, is the attitude to some persons with disabilities, particularly those with inherited disorders. It would be ironic indeed if we carried this legislation, and then in a subsequent piece of legislation&mdash;which the Minister presented in his second reading speech the other day&mdash;we entrench a system which will inevitably take the view that it is better if persons with inherited disabilities were not born. That is precisely what the outcome will be of the National Health and Medical Research Council Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know it would be contrary to Standing Orders for me to debate that particular aspect, but I flag it now. When the time comes to debate it, no doubt the Senate will be reminded not only by me but also by a number of people who appreciate the problems that will emerge from that Bill if it goes through unamended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Returning to this particular measure, I believe it is essential that the gifts of persons with disabilities be given full recognition. It might take a bit of time. I know that when I had a person with a very severe disability on my staff it took time for the office to adjust. It took time for me to adjust but, looking back on it, the adjustments ultimately really were minor. The gifts, the expertise and the deep understanding of problems that person brought to the office were something that will be appreciated not only by me, but also others in my office for a considerable time to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very often persons with disabilities, because they cope with those disabilities, have the patience, the tenacity and the dedication to see things through to their end. This was the case in respect of that employee in my office. He has now gone on to higher things&mdash;namely the Taxation Office. He went with my very strong support and I am sure he is doing well. No doubt he will give the same amount of dedication to collecting taxes as he gave to the work of my office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measure that is currently before us certainly is imperfect as of course any legislation is imperfect.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to commend to the Senate the matter that was mentioned by Senator Tambling. I think he was quite justified in seeking from the Government a list and details of the range of issues which were raised by community groups and by individuals in relation to this particular Bill&mdash;at the request of the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe). It is most unusual, I believe, for the Minister to publicly ask for submissions on a draft Bill and then, when all of those submissions are in, not provide on request to other members of the Parliament the details of the issues raised. I would have thought it would have been better for the Minister to have supplied full detail. I am not necessarily talking about names if there is some concern of privacy; I am talking about the issues.

There are problems; there are definitional problems. I think those have been canvassed before in this debate, both here and in the House of Representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the question of exemptions. I am not too sure whether the reason that the telecommunications exemption was so generous was Optus coming into the field. It would be interesting for the Committee to follow that through, and no doubt it will. The ability to communicate is an area of great importance to people with disabilities. Many of them are not very mobile at all and they need to be able to communicate, as others do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree that there should be provisions in the Bill for a wider range of consultations. I have another problem&mdash;I am not sure whether this has been raised in the debate thus far&mdash;and that is the problem of another big bureaucracy and the money going into that rather than into cutting through red tape, getting things done for persons with disabilities and bringing down the handicaps that they face in our society. Some very good ideas are often floated, but very often as well the bureaucracies that are established, with considerable expenditure on them, are too top-heavy. I know this occurs in some departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have program budgeting and some people run away with that idea. Departments set up all of these units to run certain programs. Ringing in their ears is the catchcry `Let the managers manage'. So they appoint all of these managers for all of these small units&mdash;all, of course, at a higher rate. Then the people to lose their jobs when the cuts come are those down at the other end. So some of these very good ideas, program budgeting and the like, can become a source of concern to those of us who want to see the money go where it is designed to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not deal now with a number of other issues that I would like to raise in relation to the Bill. I will wait until the Committee has examined the Bill. We will have another opportunity to discuss this matter further when the Committee reports to the Senate. We will then have the benefit of the input of the members of the Committee. I wish the members of the Committee every success in examining this measure and coming back before the chamber with recommendations which will hopefully correct some of the imperfections that are in this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise briefly to express strong support for the Disability Discrimination Bill 1992 and the accompanying Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Legislation Bill 1992. This legislation represents an important forward move for disabled people in this country; indeed, an important move for our society as a whole. I look forward to its speedy passage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Disability Services Act 1986 is a landmark piece of legislation for disabled people. It was one of the first pieces of legislation that I dealt with when I came into the Senate in 1986. As with this legislation, that legislation was not perfect either but it did move disabled people forward. As I have said, when that happens the whole community moves forward. The legislation now before us does that as well. I think it is appropriate&mdash;it is indeed essential, as Senator Chamarette has said&mdash;that the human rights and equal opportunity standards that we apply in other areas of our community should also apply with regard to disabled people, and this legislation satisfies that requirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Like Senator Chamarette, I would like to see a direct link between these two major pieces of legislation in the disability area. I will be interested in the response to her question. As I said, this legislation is not perfect. I have particular concern about the telecommunications exemption. I hope that the Government will pick up any concrete workable suggestions that might come forward by virtue of the Committee's deliberations or that have been put forward in submissions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested in the suggestion that Senator Harradine made a moment ago that the entry of a competitor in telecommunications in this country might have some bearing on this. I wonder whether the disabled people of Australia, particularly the hearing impaired or the deaf, are directly suffering right now from the deregulationist policies of economic rationalism. I think that is an area that needs further explanation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note with pleasure that the psychiatrically disabled are covered in this legislation. This was one of the major problems of the earlier Disability Services Bill&mdash;a problem which I was successful in amending so that the psychiatrically disabled could be eventually included. I see this inclusion as a flow-on from that process. I reiterate my strong support for the Bill, and I look forward to it being listed very early on the program of Government business next week when we return after the Committee's deliberations on Friday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude briefly by informing the Senate that, because I believe strongly in human rights and equal opportunity, I intend to move an amendment to the second of the two Bills in this package&mdash;the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Legislation Amendment Bill 1992&mdash;when the Bills come back into the chamber for Committee of the Whole deliberations. I will be picking up an issue that I have been pursuing for years, and with some intensity in recent months&mdash;the question of the rights of homosexual people to serve in the Australian armed forces. My amendment will ensure that the Australian defence forces cannot discriminate against homosexual people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I hope that by the time the Bill does come back to the Senate there will be no need for my amendment because Cabinet will have made a decision in favour of the rights of homosexual people, as the Caucus committee has recommended. But should that hope not be fulfilled in that interim period of a few days then I foreshadow that I will move that amendment at the committee stage. Again, I reiterate my support for these Bills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on behalf of the Government to thank those senators who contributed to the second reading debate on these Bills, principally the Disability Discrimination Bill 1992. The discussion on the principle of the Bill has been generally supportive. I need to say that, whilst I am the only speaker from the Government side during this phase of the Senate's consideration of this legislation, it is important to note the major contribution of Senator Olive Zakharov and Senator Susan West to the deliberations of the Government in forming this legislation. I am sure that they will be making a full contribution at other stages&mdash;either at the formal committee hearings on Friday or when the Bill is returned to this place for the Committee of the Whole debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some general comments have been made about the nature of disability. As Senator Harradine said, it is very difficult for those of us who are relatively physically and mentally able and well to appreciate the intense suffering&mdash;it might be physical; it might be real mental anguish; or it might be simply a sense of isolation&mdash;that is a consequence of discriminatory practices that might be visited on a person simply because of his or her disability. Not many of us in this chamber can really speak of that from the point of view of a disabled person, even though many of us would have personal experiences with close relations and even spouses who have been in that situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this Bill does enable us as a society to make it very clear that any discrimination based on disability is to be regarded as unlawful in Australian society. It will be made unlawful. There is a recognition not only of the individual hurt occasioned by such discrimination but also, of course, the social damage that would be done to Australia if such discrimination could occur without the stigma of unlawfulness being attached to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a matter for society as a whole. That is why it is intended that those Australians with disabilities ought to be able to benefit from the principles which we have recognised over the last several years as being important in relation to the other forms of discrimination. To some extent, this bears on the point I was making in the Senate during Question Time today in so far as the common law has not really protected or sustained particularly minority groups in our sort of society in their attempt to exercise and enjoy rights which are taken for granted by others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is up to the Parliament to do the hard work of trying to recognise and formulate in a practical way measures which will ensure that the inherent dignity of each person should be recognised, whether it is in relation to employment, education, sport or entertainment. That is what this Bill seeks to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A series of models is available to us in relation to racial discrimination and sex discrimination. Those models have been pretty well tested in Australia within the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission framework. This framework has been suggested as the appropriate one for dealing with any grievances that might be put forward by a person who alleges that he or she has suffered from discrimination based on disability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any determinations that are eventually made by the Commission will be as a result of the process that includes the activities of a specially designated commissioner who deals with this legislation. As a result of that process, all sorts of Commonwealth laws and programs which are there for the benefit of citizens, be they in the area of work, accommodation, education, social clubs or sport&mdash;the provision of facilities and goods of any kind&mdash;will be able to be enjoyed and participated in by all Australians without their suffering improper discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of definition has been raised. This will be more particularly the subject of a more considered detailed examination in the committee process next Friday. Quite clearly, the definition of `disability' itself is of absolutely key importance. Once again, State legislation and experience in Commonwealth legislation has been drawn upon to include the concepts of physical, sensory, intellectual, psychiatric, cognitive and neurological impairment. Without going into the definition of `disability' in toto, I believe that it is sufficiently comprehensive to enable this legislation to benefit from well-tried definitions existing in other legislation not only in Australia but in the world where we can see how other like societies deal with this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not true to say that the mere existence of a disability, which will enable this legislation to be invoked, nor discrimination based on that disability in the sense that there can be exceptions and exemptions, is enough if to acknowledge and deal with the disability would create undue hardship for the person who would have to change, for example, the physical conditions of premises. If the inherent requirements of a job militate against accepting that a person with a disability can adequately discharge a particular function, these exemptions will allow the service provider, the business or the employer concerned to discriminate, but not in an unlawful way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess that there will always be very difficult and heart rending cases where the borderline is reached. Deciding what is an inherent requirement of a job which would allow discrimination and what is the boundary line where undue hardship is really such that discrimination can be allowed to continue will prove difficult. For that reason, I believe that the task of the human rights and equal opportunity Commissioner will be the subject of scrutiny by those in this Parliament and throughout the community who are concerned with such matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this legislation will mark a major advance on the part of Australian society in providing a legislative basis to enable people with disabilities to participate in the whole life of the community and thereby to become empowered. I do not always like to use cliches that have become fashionable, but to say that people can be empowered is a well understood term these days. I believe that this legislation will allow people to enjoy a sense of being full participants in the Australian community. It will empower them to undertake various activities as a matter of right and according to their own inherent dignity in a way which may not have been possible without this legislative foundation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that such legislation be given passage in the very near future. I believe that is the common aim of most honourable senators. I look forward to the very detailed discussion that we are to hold next Friday here in Canberra. I hope that when the legislation returns to the Senate chamber it secures passage so that this important legislative foundation against discrimination, which might be visited against a person on the basis that he or she is suffering from a disability, can be established. I hope that this legislation can be passed in a way which reflects credit on this Parliament and improves the very lives of those who are disabled within our Australian community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Supply Bill (No. 3) 1992-93, Supply Bill (No. 4) 1992-93 and Loan Bill 1992 are the three Bills that are the subject of this cognate debate. Initially I will deal with them separately because they deal with quite different issues, although they all relate to the general issue of the financing of government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Supply Bill (No. 3) and Supply Bill (No. 4) seek additional interim appropriations to 30 November 1992, at which time it is anticipated that the Appropriation Bills&mdash;the Budget Bills&mdash;that were introduced in August will have been passed. Supply Bill (No. 3) seeks additional interim appropriations of $65m to meet the ordinary annual services of government. It is an additional Bill to Supply Bill (No. 1), which was passed by the Parliament on 2 June 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is seeking the additional supply because it believes that current supply will not be sufficient to fund labour market programs and road safety programs before the Appropriation Bills are passed. The normal provision for the funding of these Bills is contained in Supply Bill (No. 1) and Supply Bill (No. 2), which are passed late in the Autumn sittings each year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Supply Bill (No. 4) seeks additional interim appropriations of $105m to meet capital works expenditure, payments to the States, Territories and local government, advances and loans and various other services. It is an additional Bill to Supply Bill (No. 2), which, as I said, was passed on 2 June. It is normally the Bill that enables the Government to get through its funding requirements until the Appropriation Bills are passed in the normal way, which is usually the end of November and which will presumably be the case again this year. As with Supply Bill (No. 3), in Supply Bill (No. 4) the Government is seeking additional supply because it believes that current supply will not be sufficient to fund local government capital works&mdash;the Government's better cities and land care programs&mdash;before the Appropriations Bills are passed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although these Bills sound fairly mundane, they are unprecedented, at least in recent decades, in the sense that they were introduced into the Parliament at the same time as the Government's Appropriation Bills were introduced on Budget night, 18 August. The research I have been able to carry out indicates that that situation where additional Supply Bills have been introduced on the same day as the Budget has not occurred in the last 40 years. It appears that in 1950 additional Supply Bills were introduced on Budget night and again in 1951, but times have changed a great deal in terms of the whole of the parliamentary and budgetary procedures since that time. I am not aware of any subsequent occasion on which this situation has arisen. In modern times and under the present system of consideration of the Appropriation Bills and other matters pertaining to the funding of government, it is an unprecedented action on the part of the Government. The question has to be asked: why has the Government taken this course of action?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my friend and colleague Senator O'Chee says, it is inept. I will be coming back to that later. Essentially, the Government has taken this action because it has embarked on a rapid and very large increase in spending, totally unfunded, in many areas that were not anticipated when Supply Bill (No. 1) and Supply Bill (No. 2) were introduced and passed in the normal manner late in the Autumn session. These unprecedented Bills are a clear indication of the determination by the Government to spend up big in the early months of 1992-93 in advance of a possible early election. In other words, the Government is circumventing the normal budgetary procedures to give itself another option by putting another $170m in its coffers in the event that it might need it to buy and bribe its way to additional votes in an early election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bills also reinforce a growing impression and an actuality, as Senator O'Chee has pointed out, that the Government has lost control of its fiscal management. This is the second time in recent months that the Government has introduced extraordinary fiscal legislation. The Senate may recall that earlier this year the Government introduced not only the customary additional Appropriation Bills but also a totally unscheduled additional Appropriation Bill while those two normal additional Appropriation Bills were still before the Parliament. The reason for that was gross financial incompetence on the part of the Government and an essential reason for the two Bills that we are debating now being before us. It is a continuation of that gross fiscal mismanagement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the hidden agenda of giving the Government more money to finance its vote buying bribes in the event of an early election. The normal way of financing the expenditures that the Government says are required to be met in the Supply Bills is to handle it through the Advance to the Minister for Finance. In his second reading speech on these Bills the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) discounted that option because he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it would run the very real risk that there would be insufficient funds available to meet other urgent and unforeseen requirements.</PARA>
<PARA>That is absolute nonsense. The amount sought in these Supply Bills is relatively small, although in total it adds up to $170m. In the total scheme of things, with a Budget of $100 billion, it is small. But the Government has seen a way in which it may be able to winkle out an additional $170m at an earlier stage than would otherwise be available for it. It is sheer nonsense for the Government to claim that it has to use this process in order to meet the expenditures that it claims it has to meet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Estimates committee hearings we asked the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) and officials from the Department of Finance about the need for the urgency in meeting these spending requirements. It transpired that there was no real urgency, at least in the sense of any contractual commitments by the Government. It is simply another ploy to try to buy votes for the next election. In that context, on behalf of the Opposition I move:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At end of motion, add ", but the Senate:</PARA>

<PARA>I come to the second reason for these Supply Bills&mdash;namely, the fiscal incompetence of this Government and the ravages that it has wreaked on the Australian community through that gross fiscal incompetence and policy irresponsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Loan Bill 1992 is a standard mechanical Bill to enable the Government to finance that fiscal irresponsibility. The Loan Bill gives the Government the authority to borrow funds for the 1992-93 fiscal year. It is necessary to meet any shortfalls that occur between the moneys appropriated by Parliament in the Budget and the funds available through the Consolidated Revenue Fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, there will be a requirement this year for such borrowing. Indeed, the Government's financial strategy this year and its incompetence have collectively combined to mean that the Government will have, on its own figures, a financing requirement of no less than $18.5 billion. There is every indication that that figure is highly conservative. We have learnt, through Estimates committee questioning, for example, that there is a real possibility, if not probability, that $1.5 billion, or thereabouts, that is factored into the Budget by way of assets sales&mdash;that means the sale of Qantas&mdash;will not be achieved this year. If that occurs, the Government's own financing requirement on its own figures will blow out to in excess of $20 billion. That is a figure in the order of 5 per cent plus&mdash;it is closer to 5.2 per cent&mdash;of GDP. That figure exceeds even the worst excesses of the Whitlam years&mdash;years of fiscal vandalism&mdash;which led to many of the problems with which we are still living in Australia today. That proportion of GDP that the financing requirement will need this year&mdash;that excess of 5.2 per cent&mdash;is twice the deficit and borrowing requirement in the last year of the Fraser Government in 1982-83, a year that the present Government has on many occasions sought to make capital out of in terms of the fiscal incompetence of that previous Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me put on the record again, because it is not generally known or appreciated in the community, that the deficit we face this year as a proportion of our total national income is greater than the worst excesses of the Whitlam years and is twice the figure of the last year of the Fraser Government. That situation represents the greatest unravelling of and deterioration in the Commonwealth's fiscal position that we have had in the history of this nation. Only two years ago the Government ran a freakish surplus of $8 billion. In the two short years to the end of 1991-92, that $8 billion surplus&mdash;a very welcome surplus&mdash;turned into a deficit of $9.4 billion. So in two years alone there was a deterioration in the Commonwealth's fiscal position&mdash;and therefore the fiscal position of every Australian, every Australian taxpayer and every future Australian taxpayer&mdash;of $17.4 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this financial year, this Budget year, the Government, on its own conservative estimates, is running up another deficit of $13.4 billion. If we remove the one-offs, if we exclude, for example, the proceeds of assets sales, the extraordinary Reserve Bank profits and a couple of other pieces of creative accounting, the real underlying deficit this year is $20.5 billion, and almost certainly that will be exceeded.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So that adds on to the $17.4 billion deterioration we have had in the last two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the Government's own forecasts out to 1995-96, the Government will chalk up another cumulative deficit of the order of $50 billion. Only six months ago, the Government, in its One Nation statement, said that it was going to move the Budget back into surplus by 1995-96. Within six months that statement had been blown out of the water by the Government itself. It was forced in the Budget to recant on that, to retract that figure and to say that by 1995-96 it would have a deficit of approximately 1.25 per cent of GDP&mdash;and that is on the basis of a very optimistic growth forecast. The figure of 1.25 per cent of GDP equals $6 billion or thereabouts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government alluded to having to put up a few taxes down the road, but it was not going to say in the Budget or at any subsequent time what those tax increases would be. It was only due to intense pressure from the coalition that the Government was forced two or three weeks ago to produce its proposals for this increased tax revenue, and we know what it came up with. It came up with additional tax revenue proposals starting in about 1994 of $2.5 billion, or thereabouts, a year. In other words, even on the Government's own figures, it is still going to have a gigantic hole in its fiscal position of a minimum of $4 billion to $5 billion and almost certainly less in 1995-96, even with the tax increases that it has foreshadowed. The only conclusion one can draw from that is that the tax increases that were announced two to three weeks ago are the first instalment. There has to be a major further increase in taxes for the Government to meet its now stated intention of balancing the books by the middle of the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister, the former Treasurer, the chief architect&mdash;the deliberate architect&mdash;of the recession that we had to have has the gall to suggest, as he did in Parliament yesterday, that the recession has long gone, that we are now well out of recession. I wonder whether the Prime Minister has mentioned that to the 950,000 people who are officially unemployed in Australia, including the in excess of 300,000 long term unemployed people. I wonder whether he has mentioned it to the 680,000 Australian children who live in families with no form of employment. I wonder whether he has mentioned it to the further one million or so people who are either the hidden unemployed&mdash;not included in the statistics&mdash;or the underemployed. I wonder whether he has mentioned it to the countless thousands of small businesses that have gone to the wall in the last couple of years and that are still going to the wall as a result of his policies. I wonder whether he has mentioned it to some of the major companies in Australia which, as we pointed out in the Senate today on several occasions, have said quite categorically that economic recovery in Australia will not be under way at least for the next two, three or four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Government has done with this year's Budget, and what it is using the Loan Bill as a mechanical device to fund, is to provide Australia with one of the most spendthrift Budgets relative to the needs of our circumstances that we have ever had in our history. There has been an enormous increase in government spending this year, a 9 per cent increase&mdash;$9 billion, or 6 per cent in real terms. It has put enormous pressure on financial markets. The inevitable result of that will be to push up interest rates. Senator Collins, who is present in the chamber, might care to confirm this a bit later, but the Caucus economic committee yesterday received a report from the ANZ Bank which said that interest rates would go higher under the policies of this Government. We have all the seeds of a further major blow-out in the balance of payments, which continues to be in huge deficit. We are now in hock to the rest of the world by $150,000 million, that is, more than $8500 for every man, woman and child in this nation. That is a figure that compares with our debt to the rest of the world of $8 billion net around the time that the Hawke Labor Government first came to office in 1983. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what we have seen during the 1980s and the early 1990s is a progressive deterioration in Australia's standard of living. Countless hundreds of thousands of people, particularly middle Australians, now suffer a lower living standard in absolute terms than they did 10 years ago. Every Australian is suffering a fall in his or her relative living standard compared with 10 years ago when we look at the performance of this nation compared with that of our trading partners and most other countries around the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have fundamental problems in this country which are unprecedented. We have a Government which has absolutely lost control of the fiscal situation. That is part of the reason why we have these Bills before us today. We have a Prime Minister who, as Treasurer, caused those problems and who now says that those problems are behind us, when it is clear to every person in the real world, in the real Australia&mdash;I do not know where the Prime Minister gets his information from; he is not prepared to tell us&mdash;that the recession is far from behind us. Indeed, if anything, in many important quarters it is worsening. Certainly the hardship and the cruelty of that recession are biting as deeply now as ever they were. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for those reasons that, whilst not opposing these Bills because they are essentially mechanical Bills, the coalition nevertheless believes that, firstly, the Supply Bills are unnecessary and, secondly, are the result of gross fiscal mismanagement and policy incompetence on the part of this Government. The Loan Bill will certainly be required this year more than in most previous years to finance the gigantic hole in the Government's finances. That is why I have moved the amendment, which has now been circulated, to the Supply Bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that my colleagues in this debate will follow me in condemning the Government for the tremendous economic hardship it has caused in this country and for the difficulties it has built into this nation that make a solution to our problems more intractable day by day. The only solution that we have for any sustainable basis in Australia today is to get rid of this Government at the first possible opportunity and to replace it with a government which is prepared to take the decisions that will enable Australians, individuals and businesses, to have the incentive, the hope and the opportunity for growth in the future for employment, for wealth creation&mdash;for all those things that are necessary to return the Australia of the 1990s to the Australia which we cherished and benefited so much from in the 1960s, up until the tragedies that befell it as a result of the policies of the Whitlam Government and later the Hawke Government. The sooner that change is made the better; the longer it is delayed the more intractable those problems will become. </PARA>

To reinforce some of those points&mdash;indeed, to make some extra ones&mdash;I refer to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of the Estimates Committee hearing on 22 September when Senator Short, Senator Kemp and I asked questions of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Senator McMullan, about the reasons for the Supply Bills being used as a tool to give the Government the ability to spend and spend quickly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at precedent, we have previously seen the Government in need of appropriating additional funds. When the Iraq-Kuwait war was declared and prosecuted, we found ourselves with a shortfall on payment for wheat, the `insurance' for which is organised by EFIC but which in fact is paid out of Consolidated Revenue. In order for additional money to be made available, there was an additional appropriation Bill introduced, thereby allowing the money to be properly appropriated and spent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case, we have, if you like, a similar circumstance. We have not had war declared but we have had a recession declared. There are additional expenditures, as Senator Short pointed out. Part of the additional expenditure is $170m for programs for which there is no appropriation. The Government might argue that it had not decided it was going to spend that additional money at the time of the preparation of the Budget or the Appropriation Bills themselves so it needed another mechanism. Surely, precedent could have been followed and there could have been an additional No. 3 appropriation Bill which very simply would have appropriated that money in the proper and orderly way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The questioning that went on in the Estimates Committee will show why the Government was not interested in following proper procedure. Senator Short said during the hearing that the overwhelming impression he got was that the Government had taken this course of action to enable it to spend very heavily in the first few months of this financial year to give itself an additional option in terms of an early election and, in doing so, had adopted procedures in terms of budgetary processes that were unprecedented. Senator Short asked Senator McMullan whether he wanted to comment. Senator McMullan said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think that is so silly that it is not worth making a comment. I have nothing to add.</PARA>
<PARA>I then asked Senator McMullan:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Supply Bills will give you instant money, will they not?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator McMullan replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When they are passed, they will give us the right to spend $170m for the purposes set out in the Bills.</PARA>
<PARA>I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Manager of Government Business, how quickly do you think you will get those Bills through? </PARA>
<PARA>Senator McMullan replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I expect that they will be passed in the next sitting week.</PARA>
<PARA>I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So we will have instantly $170m. How much do we have left in the Advance to the Minister for Finance?</PARA>
<PARA>That question, of course, was unable to be answered by anyone; and I am still waiting for the answer. Of course, a mechanism that could have been used by the Government&mdash;if it wished, if it had gone the appropriation Bill route&mdash;was to have sought an Advance from the Minister for Finance and spent the money on the basis that it would be reimbursed once the Appropriation Bills were passed. The problem with that is that there is not enough money left in the Advance to the Minister for Finance to allow that money to be withdrawn and meet the other demands that would be placed upon it before the Appropriation Bills are passed. When I asked Senator McMullan when he expected to get the Appropriation Bills, he replied, `The end of November'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have seen that the real reason for the use and the creation of these two Supply Bills very simply is to allow the Government to have instant cash to spend in case it wants to have an early election. All along, this early election option has been maintained by the Government, looking for a window of opportunity. The Victorian election last week has probably shut that window, but at the time of the drafting of these Supply Bills and the working out of this strategy the Government needed to keep that window open, to keep the opportunity of an early election in December or at the end of November available to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Government were to get any advantage out of the programs, the intent of which is set out in the Bills, it would have to spend the money now. The only way it can spend the money now is to have these Supply Bills, which are unprecedented in being introduced contemporaneously with the Appropriation Bills. I can only imagine that the money that it will spend now will have to be finally appropriated in the Supplementary Estimates next year, unless we have an additional Bill somewhere else along the line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are seeing is a highly contrived use of Bills which were designed very simply for another purpose but which are serving the Government's purpose of the day. It is not the good government of Australia&mdash;which is what it is charged with&mdash;but is simply political servicing because it gets a political advantage out of getting instant money. I will quote again from the Estimates Committee hearings. I asked Senator McMullan:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Supply Bills will give you instant money, will they not?</PARA>
<PARA>He replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When they are passed, they will give us the right to spend $170m for the purposes set out in the Bills.</PARA>
<PARA>That is at the end of this week. It is cynical, but no more cynical, as Senator Short pointed out when he dealt with the Loan Bill, than saying that because of the additional expenditure again the mechanism is needed to allow additional funds to be raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Short's amendment condemns the Government for the use of these contrivances and condemns the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for being so out of touch with the reality of the continuing economic recession and hardship&mdash;of which he, on his own acknowledgment, was the chief architect&mdash;that he can assert that Australia's recession ended long ago. Ask the million people who are unemployed if the recession ended long ago; ask the 300,000 Australians who are now long term unemployed if it ended long ago; and ask the school leavers who are facing the prospect of attempting to get into the work force next year if the recession ended long ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have in our Prime Minister a man who is politically clever: he knows how to use a contrivance to get his hands on an additional $170m cash now to spend for political advantage; he knows how to borrow and add to our international debt so that he can meet his additional expenditure which is, quite frankly, necessary because of ineptitude on behalf of the Government's handling of legislation and, of course, the economy itself. It is a very cynical exercise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When something like Supply Bills are listed on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> they do not normally excite much interest, but on this occasion I think it is necessary to point out that it is a very cynical use of a mechanism which was designed for another purpose but which this very politically clever Prime Minister has seen he can use to his own political advantage. At least perhaps those who are listening to this particular debate or those who read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> will be alerted to the fact that the good government of Australia is not the aim and object of this Government; it is merely to stay in office. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Budget has fallen apart already and Supply Bill (No. 3) 1992-93 and cognate Bills are simply the latest manifestation of it. Enormous changes have taken place since the Budget was brought down only two months ago. At that time the Budget looked pretty phoney anyway. Now it is looking even worse&mdash;and that is against the background of two consecutive years of hopeless Budget forecasting where the Government made the record level of mistakes that have ever been known in Budget forecasting. In the last two years the Government has been a total of $10 1/2 billion wrong in its estimates of its Budget or deficit&mdash;and, of course, in this case deficit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the handing down of the Budget, events unfolding around the world have brought a dramatic change in the situation in which this Government is now budgeting and, of course, in the situation in which it is introducing these particular Bills to cope with some additional pump priming expenditure. I will go into the merit of that in a minute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us consider the factors that are helping to destroy an already wobbly Budget. There has been a collapse of the European exchange rate mechanism and significant downgrading of European economic growth forecasts, which will clearly affect Australia's trading opportunities in the world; a further substantial reduction in Japanese economic growth forecasts for the forthcoming year, which clearly will have a direct impact on Australia; and signs that the United States economy has virtually stopped its already weak growth altogether and may yet again slip into recession. Obviously this worldwide unravelling of economic prospects will have implications on the Australian economy and, of course, this already demonstrated-to-be incompetent Budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One wonders what the Government is actually doing to shore up its budgetary position and the Australian economic position. We can see that these Bills&mdash;these politically motivated unprecedented Bills&mdash;are aimed at priming the pump, at doing the old and proven wrong thing at the wrong time in terms of what is right for the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Things in fact are worse than these three external changes that I have pointed out. As evidence of that, one has only to look at Max Walsh's column in this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>. In that column he reminds Australia of something that a lot of the commentators appear to have forgotten&mdash;and certainly the Government appears never to have recognised or understood&mdash;and that is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Australian dollar has depreciated against the mark by 21 per cent in the past six months. In terms of the trade-weighted index we have depreciated by 11 per cent in the last six months.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And as for those falling stockmarkets!</PARA>
<PARA>That is those stock markets overseas which have been attracting headlines in Australia. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, our market is 13.8 per cent off its year's high compared with a fall of 10.6 per cent in the UK and 6.8 per cent on Wall Street.</PARA>
<PARA>We are far worse. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One other market indicator is long-term bond rates adjusted for inflation. Again we lead the pack, with the highest real long-term interest rates in the top dozen or so capital markets.</PARA>
<PARA>As the ANZ Bank has advised the Labor Caucus committee, interest rates under this Government clearly look as if they could go higher. We have a situation where the scribes report that the UK economy is in a financial and political crisis, yet here in Australia the foreign exchange, equity and bond markets are all performing decidedly worse than in the United Kingdom and nobody seems to be mentioning the word `crisis'. In fact, Mr Keating says, `The recession is over, everything is wonderful'. As someone pointed out in Question Time today, maybe for him it is, because he has managed to turn his $430,000 investment in a piggery into an investment worth $4.3m within only six months.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, as Senator O'Chee interjects, he has also ballooned our foreign debt at the same time. Maybe for Mr Keating the recession is over when he looks at the increase in his own personal fortune. But clearly, here in Australia, as Max Walsh says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we are having a crisis by stealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">International investors have taken the collective view that this is now a hazardous economy. Surprisingly, our global unpopularity goes largely unnoticed and unremarked. Much more media attention has been focused on the pound than on the rapid decline of our currency in the past six months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, Prime Minister Keating's proud, but dubious boast at the time of his One Nation statement that Australia would be leading the way out of recession retains a quite surprising street credibility.</PARA>
<PARA>What we have to wonder is: in these circumstances, having now as Prime Minister the world's greatest Treasurer, why are the markets giving us such a poor rating, and does it matter anyway? Max Walsh says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It certainly matters, as demonstrated by the sorry state of the equity markets, the failure of the Westpac rights issue and the aborting of the Woolworths float. We need foreign investors in our equity market and they are simply not there in anywhere near the representation of the past. Weak equity markets mean the required process of de-leveraging corporate balance sheets is going to take longer than anybody expected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recent instability in global exchange markets and the failure of the US economy to recover as expected and the implications of this for commodity prices have no doubt brought an element of additional caution into global capital markets. However, the disenchantment with Australia pre-dated these developments. It began after the One Nation statement that relaunched the Labor Government under Paul Keating.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a departure from the deliberately prudent approach of his predecessor, Mr Keating indicated that he wanted to use the fiscal accelerator to get the economy moving. While pump-priming plays well at the local level it is anathema to the international investment community when an economy has excessive foreign debt and a chronic current account deficit.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, what Mr Keating is doing is aimed directly and solely at an election. These are part of a political stunt that are doing major long term damage to Australia's status, standing and capacity to have long term and real economic recovery. As Max Walsh says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Government is in election mode. And what is more, it believes it has half a chance.</PARA>
<PARA>That is, of course, if it keeps throwing money at the problem. He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequently the shift in political rhetoric already evident in Mr Keating's tariff policies is not an encouraging sign. . . </PARA>
<PARA>He described it as&mdash;and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . an increasingly populist approach by the Government. If this risk is validated then the deterioration in our exchange, equity and bond markets will inevitably continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such a crisis of confidence in the markets, and that is what would be involved if foreign investors continue to walk away from the Australian market, would pull the floor from under the existing wheat recovery.</PARA>
<PARA>He concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This could be a very expensive election for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>That is not a problem that would worry Mr Keating; it never has in the past. He has been prepared to say anything at any time, do anything at any time, to grab hold of and maintain power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what is happening to the Australian economy now. Certainly, he has been prepared to say anything. We all remember the expression which has every day usage, `This is the recession we had to have', but a lot of people have forgotten some of his other more appealing remarks. On 4 December 1990, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the recession&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is not a condition beyond control, it is a condition in fact engineered by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA>If it is not out of control, do we say to Mr Keating, `Well, what you have engineered certainly looks like being out of control'? I think one could say that if it walks like a pig, smells like a pig and oinks like a pig, presumably it is a pig. Mr Keating certainly has intimate financial relationships, at least, with pigs.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Knowles is quite right&mdash;as long as he can win the next election, and that is what this legislation is all about and that is what economic mismanagement by this Government is going to be all about in the next six months or so. It is going to be aimed at short term appeal to the voters, and I am certain that the Australian public will be sensible enough to see through it. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at this question of why we had this recession, anyway&mdash;the recession that Mr Keating happily says he engineered. Some people are saying, `It came from foreign parts'. Let us look at that because Dr David Morgan was one of the top people in the Australian Treasury until he moved across to Westpac. In an article in Westpac's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Issues</EMPHASIS> magazine&mdash;and I take the point that maybe Westpac is an appropriate place for someone from the Australian Treasury to go, in view of the size of the deficits and the miscalculations in both cases&mdash;Dr Morgan compares the 1982-83 Fraser recession with the 1990-91-92 Keating recession which, of course, is the worst since the Depression. Dr Morgan, who, by the way, is the husband of Mrs Kelly, the `Minister for having a good time', said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1982-83 recession was caused by a combination of external and domestic factors, the 1990-91 recession by purely domestic factors.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a former top Government adviser in the Treasury, saying that this recession is due to purely domestic factors. He puts the blame for the old Fraser recession, the 1982-83 one which we are still hearing about in this chamber, on oil price rises that hit the world's major economies, coinciding with a severe Australian drought which halved the value of rural production while a wages explosion squeezed profits and caused job losses. However, this is what he says about the 1990-91 recession, the present recession:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main catalyst for the 1990-91 recession in Australia was the Government's&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that is, the Keating Government; he was the Treasurer then&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">imposition of high interest rates aimed at curbing rapid growth in domestic spending (primarily business investment).</PARA>
<PARA>But the seeds had been sown, he says, by the Hawke Government's mishandling of the recovery from the 1982-83 recession. Remember, of course, who the Treasurer was&mdash;it was the world's greatest Treasurer, Mr Keating. The seeds had been sown by the Hawke Government's mishandling of the recovery from the 1982-83 recession as&mdash;and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . most of the gains in reducing inflation during the recession were lost in an over-rapid recovery.</PARA>
<PARA>By the way, the Reserve Bank's annual report for 1990-91 takes the same view. This incompetence, this mishandling by Mr Keating as Treasurer, laid the groundwork for the spending boom, high inflation and large balance of payments problem of the late 1980s so that&mdash;and I quote Dr Morgan again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . another recession, this time due only to national problems, became inevitable.</PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly the sort of situation that Mr Keating is repeating right now and that this legislation is part of. It is part of an inevitable economic disaster as Mr Keating tries to buy his way back into power, just as in the past he has misled the Australian people with absolute nonsense to try to win, and succeed in winning, elections in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Argus, the Chief Executive of the National Australia Bank, said yesterday that Australia could not afford the Government's unfunded tax cuts because they would over-stimulate the economy leading to a blow-out in Australia's foreign debt&mdash;a debt, by the way, which now stands at $150 billion or almost $9,000 for every man, woman and child in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So here we have the same sorts of warnings, this time from the National Australia Bank, that Dr Morgan had given&mdash;as I said, an ex-senior economic adviser, a top economic adviser, of this Government, who is now with Westpac. Here we have these warnings against what this Government is doing now. Already in the Budget it was government spending that was pushing the economy along. As the Budget Papers say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Public sector final demand will continue to support activity in 1992-93, with a pick-up in spending through the year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Strong growth in both Commonwealth and State/local sector investment is expected in 1992-93.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both Commonwealth and State/local sector consumption is forecast to grow moderately.</PARA>
<PARA>But there we have it: that is where all the growth is, that is where all the activity is&mdash;government spending, in other words, the spending of taxpayers' money or the spending of borrowed money, putting Australia's economic recovery at real risk. Because of this spending, imports in the Budget are projected to rise more quickly than demand as domestic expenditure recovers. Of course, that is mainly government spending. Even at that point, the Budget was recognising&mdash;and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subdued growth in the world economy, particularly the slowdown in Japan, and smaller increments to capacity in the non-rural sector are expected to constrain export growth.</PARA>
<PARA>So here we have a major economic problem being worsened by this Budget and worsened even more by the sort of pump-priming spending involved in these latest supply Bills. And there was to be a worsening of the current account deficit even before these latest bits of evidence of the disastrous economic problems we face had become available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this sounds bad enough for the economy, but what does it mean for the ordinary Australians who are out of work&mdash;the one million people who are officially unemployed, the 800,000 who, according to the Bureau of Statistics, are the hidden unemployed, and the 600,000 who are underemployed and can get only part time work? What do all these figures and this sort of disaster mean for them? The essential answer is: nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this Government has been doing in this Budget and these Bills is throwing money at a problem without solving it. In fact, it is making it worse in the long run by trying to get some temporary help or doing some temporary papering over of the cracks in the run-up to the next election. It is being helped, I might say, by some extraordinary statements from the Governor of Reserve Bank, Bernie Fraser, who, as the Senate remembers, has been the subject of considerable criticism in the past by the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will quote Max Walsh again, this time from Tuesday's paper where he totally rejects Mr Fraser's claim that Australia does not have a long term employment problem but only a short term one. It is incredible the way the Governor of the Reserve Bank always seems to be able to put a gloss on things that happen to suit to Government's line. Max Walsh states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The trouble is that the Governor, and by extension the Reserve Bank and the Government, has got it wrong&mdash;horribly wrong. We do have a long-term employment problem. . . and a serious one at that.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the simple fact is that this Government managed to fund its expansion of the labour market by borrowing from abroad at levels that were far above those of the past and far above what we will be able to borrow in the future. Max Walsh says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nobody for one moment&mdash;including Governor Fraser&mdash;imagines the rest of the world will continue to underwrite Australia's employment growth in the future in the fashion in which it did through the 80s.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A very much higher level of domestic savings is required to finance investment and produce remotely comparable employment outcomes to the 80s.</PARA>
<PARA>He gives other reasons why we do have a long term problem&mdash;one which this Budget and these Bills before us will simply worsen. As Max Walsh says, if policy is being formulated on the basis of that proposition&mdash;that is, that we are having only a short term employment problem as the Governor of the Reserve Bank says&mdash;we are digging Australia into a deep hole. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If Mr Fraser is engaged in a political exercise to give credibility to the Keating Government then he is destroying the integrity of the Reserve Bank.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Either way we are all losers.</PARA>
<PARA>I hope that the only loser to emerge from this will be this Government. I hope that this Government will be replaced in time to bring to an end these disastrous policies that are putting so many people out of work, putting so many Australians in situations where they are underemployed, putting so many Australians in the position where they do not even bother being on the unemployed list&mdash;they are the hidden unemployed&mdash;and putting so many Australians in a position where their economic future and the future of their children when they leave school will be massively diminished to suit the short term political objectives of a power hungry Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These Bills are part of his short term policy of self-aggrandisement and holding desperately on to power.

Yet tonight we have before us Supply Bills Nos. 3 and 4 which are an indictment of this Government's own excesses, this Government's own financial irresponsibility and this Government's own inability to balance the books. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lest anyone be misled, these Bills are designed to achieve one purpose and one purpose only. What is that purpose? It is to give the Government instant money, not for the benefit of the economy, not for the good maintenance of office, but rather, as Senator Baume, Senator Bishop and Senator Short before me have said, to put money in the Government's war chest for an impending election.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have a government that came before the Senate in August this year and said quite brazenly that it intended to run a deficit of $13.4 billion. That is $13,400m of deficit. Here we have a government that came before the Senate and said in the Budget that it had a financing requirement and needed to borrow $18 1/2 billion. Here we have a government that has come before this country in the greatest recession since the 1930s and said, `Instead of having good financial management, we are going to spend and spend wantonly'. Where has it sourced the money? It has sourced the money from overseas, by pillaging the finances and the savings base of this nation and by making poorer the corporate sector and this nation's long term finances, which are what we really need to depend upon in order to generate a real recovery.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to make some points on behalf of my colleague Senator Walters, who is not here. Yesterday in the Senate, Senator Cook attempted to extricate himself from a very deep hole which he had managed to dig for himself in relation to a number of answers he had previously given my colleague Senator Walters regarding the loss of a very important joint venture with the Russians from the Hobart waterfront. As Senator Walters is not here and I am the only other southern-based Tasmanian Liberal senator, I believe I should take a few moments to briefly comment on Senator Cook's additional response to Senator Walters that I missed yesterday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noted with irony when I perused the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> that Senator Cook concluded his answer on 9 September by claiming in respect of Senator Walters:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think she ends up with egg all over her face.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the initial answer he gave to the first question Senator Walters asked on 9 September. I think it is quite clear to anyone who had a chance to look at Senator Cook's rather pathetic attempts at backtracking yesterday that it was not Senator Walters who ended up with egg on her face but the Minister himself. There is no doubt, if there was any doubt before, that in providing his answer to Senator Walters on 9 September the Minister made a number of comments which were completely and utterly untrue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is up to us in the Senate to judge for ourselves the motivation for the Minister's action, but surely any Minister of this Government has an obligation to come into this chamber and give answers that can be substantiated. This was not so in Senator Cook's case. Just as importantly, by coming into this chamber and making a number of incorrect and totally unsubstantiated allegations regarding Trident Seafoods, the Minister has damaged the standing in the community of that company. With that in mind, what Senator Walters and Trident Seafoods received from the Minister yesterday was nothing more than very shallow justice indeed. They both deserve&mdash;and I believe the Senate deserves&mdash;a total and unequivocal apology from the Minister, Senator Cook, for the answer he gave in the Senate on 9 September. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will quickly illustrate how that comes about and how Senator Cook not only got egg on his face but also was caught with his pants down. On 9 September, Senator Cook said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All I can say about that allegation is that I understand there are other reasons as to why this company is facing financial difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA>Yesterday in his answer that had become, with great licence and a fair amount of imagination:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I should have referred to the possibility of the joint venture facing difficulties having regard to problems encountered by similar joint venture proposals in other States when apparently the Russian partners had difficulty in meeting their contribution to the venture.</PARA>
<PARA>I am sure honourable senators would agree that the Minister's explanation bears no relation to his initial comments. If anyone has any doubts I will read it again. Initially, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All I can say about that allegation is that I understand there are other reasons as to why this company is facing financial difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA>Then yesterday he comes out and blames the Russians for it. Further, on 9 September the Minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The advice I have before me is advice that the company had decided to abandon this enterprise before it had even started to negotiate what the terms and conditions would be for the handling of this fish on the waterfront in Hobart.</PARA>
<PARA>Yesterday, Senator Cook said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I should have said that the negotiations were not concluded before the announced withdrawal of the project, which I indicated in a subsequent answer on 14 September.</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister was right about one thing: he should have said a lot of things which he did not say and not said a lot of things which he did say. I believe that the Minister has been guilty of either misleading the Senate or at least of not doing his homework before attempting to answer Senator Walters's question. There is a lesson for the Minister in this: if you do not know the full facts you are better off not saying anything. Under the circumstances, I therefore call upon the Minister to provide a full and unreserved apology to both Senator Walters and Trident Seafoods for the answer he gave on 9 September. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On a number of occasions in adjournment debates I have brought to the Senate cases of Australian citizens being concerned about the use of chemicals in an inappropriate manner in the places in which they live. Tonight I bring yet another example of the concern of Australian citizens about the way chemicals are used.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the widespread use of various chemicals in our society has manifested itself in residues in our soil, air, water, food and animals, residues have now been found in our children. I am referring to a group of seven children from the Coffs Harbour region. Residues in the children affected range from organochlorins and solvents to heavy metals, et cetera. The common link in these children is that they have unexplained health problems as our medical and health authorities have concluded. This is part of a theme I have presented on the several occasions I have raised these sorts of matters in the adjournment debate; that is, our health and medical authorities are unable to deal with the problems that have become associated with the mysteries of how misused chemicals affect our population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the children I refer to, if not all of them, have been and are being treated by our medical system with no success. Currently, there is little or no research into the health effects of low level residues in children. There is negligible interest being shown, no records being kept and no active research programs established by our health authorities on these children's cases. Indeed, our health authorities ostracised many medical practitioners or specialists who studied these cases and who put forward links between toxic chemical residues and effects on health. I wonder whether that could be described in any way as a scientific approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Blood samples from these seven children, from four to eight years of age, were tested in the United States nationally recognised laboratory, ACCU CHEM. The ACCU CHEM laboratories are located at 990 Bowser Street 800, Richardson, Texas. This laboratory is the same one used by the American military for tests on the effects of chemical warfare. This is a credible organisation with a reputation for accurate results. Comparisons were then</PARA>
<PARA>made between the residue levels of the Coffs  Harbour children and an American testing laboratory population average, predominantly made up of adults. It should be noted that these American adults had chemical residues higher than normal for them to be tested in the first place, which makes the residue levels in Coffs Harbour children all the more alarming. I seek leave to incorporate a brief table of comparisons. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7U4">Senator BELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the benefit of my colleagues in the chamber at the moment, I would like to give just a few examples of the residue levels of 17 toxic chemicals found in the children's blood. Hexachlorobenzene was found to be present at the rate of up to 22 times higher in Coffs Harbour children than in the American testing population average.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, Beta-BHC was up to 22 times higher; Dieldrin up to seven times higher; DDE up to 3.5 times higher; Toluene up to seven times higher; Trichloroethane up to 16.5 times higher; and Benzene up to five times higher. I am sure that you would agree, Mr Acting Deputy President, that these are all formidable sounding residues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of these seven children live in the Coffs Harbour residential areas. One of the children is named Andrew Want and I will outline his case history in summary. After a normal birth, young Andrew, at six days, developed rapid breathing at approximately twice the normal rate. At six weeks he was diagnosed with gastric reflux. Not until six months was he breathing at a normal rate. At 18 months he was coughing persistently, and at two years Andrew was diagnosed as asthmatic and put on medication via a nebuliser three times a day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At three years of age Andrew ceased medication six weeks after the parents bought a water purifier. At four years he experienced periodic headaches and stomach aches. His learning ability regressed, his social development regressed and emotionally he became very delicate. At 4 1/2 years he had intermittent rectal bleeding. After two hospitalisations in a well respected children's hospital in Sydney, no explanation was given other than that Andrew's condition was described as psychological. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His parents then lost faith in the medical system and took the only measures that were left open to them. They modified the total chemical load in the house and school environment. They established a diet of organic food while eliminating all dairy products. As a result of these measures, Andrew's health improved substantially. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At five to six years of age Andrew gradually improved to progress through school at an average to above average ability. Nevertheless, he remains sensitised to many common chemicals, especially solvents in white board markers, textas, car fumes, aerial spray drift, and herbicides applied by local councils to roadsides. When exposed to these toxic substances he suffers the physical and neurological effects all over again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The plight of Andrew and these other children is frightful. What is also frightening is that they are not isolated cases, as I have demonstrated before when speaking during amendment debates. Many other children from other Australian towns and cities have accumulated heavy metals such as lead well above overseas levels. I have to say `many other' because unfortunately this reflects the lack of attention, research and baseline data that our health authorities should have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That immediately raises the questions: why are not our scientists in various research units of government departments and universities studying these cases? Why are not our authorities tracking down how, where, when and why these children are accumulating such levels, and why are they not doing something about it? I am afraid that this question remains rhetorical. The answer can be given only when sufficient recognition is given to these problems and they are not considered as problems to be wiped away and beyond understanding. We need to address ourselves to how we can understand these problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be interesting to see how balanced the National Health and Medical Research Council is in assessing safety and health effects when approving the large number of chemicals for use throughout our community. I will expand on that at another time. But for the moment, I want to state again in this place that we are able to see that chemical residues are accumulating in our children. Clearly, there is a huge gap in a registration system for chemical use where the health of our community is not given sufficient consideration, let alone our top priority. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to provide some short response to the speech made by Senator Kemp yesterday in the adjournment debate in which he trotted out some figures which sought to juxtapose the number of times the Democrats voted with the Government as against the number of times they voted with the Opposition. Today Senator Kemp took some exception to the name that was given to him by Senator Coulter&mdash;namely, the Shadow Minister for Democrat bashing. While I think that was amply justified, I will use his proper title tonight, which is Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am quite happy to give Senator Kemp that formal and correct title because I want to refer the Senate to an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> dated 13 October that deals with Mr Hewson's master plan. No doubt, as Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader, Senator Kemp thoroughly agrees, actively supports and promotes to the best of his ability Dr Hewson's objective. As this article says, that objective is to obtain control of both Houses. If he does not do so at the 1993 election, then certainly at a subsequent election, which Dr Hewson would no doubt call on the basis of a double dissolution. It is quite clear that Senator Kemp is doing his level best to achieve that objective&mdash;namely, to decimate the Democrats to a point where Dr Hewson would be able to control both Houses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I have news for Dr Hewson and Senator Kemp. I am sorry that Senator Kemp is not able to be in the chamber tonight; I advised his office that I would be providing him with a response. No doubt this debate will be continued at another time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought it would be useful and instructive if the Senate were informed briefly of a number of instances where Senator Kemp and his colleagues voted with the Government against initiatives, amendments and other parliamentary actions of the Democrats. This is much more instructive than simply trotting out figures, because figures by themselves do not mean anything. We really need to look at the substance of the motion that is before the Senate and the action that has been taken by Senator Kemp and his colleagues. In view of the advancing hour, I will use only a few examples; I could use many more than I will tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 14 February 1991, Senator Kemp and his colleagues voted against a Democrat urgency motion calling on the Government to establish a royal commission into bank practices in Australia. We all know that this would have been fully justified. The history of bank practice in Australia is now well and truly on the table. The fact that many people have lost their savings, that the banks have lost a lot of money, that the share price has gone down and that the banks have not fulfilled their duties under the financial system that is operating is clear. I welcome Senator Kemp, who has just walked into the chamber. He will be very pleased to hear once again that he voted on 14 February 1991 against the Democrats' efforts to establish a royal commission into bank practices in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 10 April 1991, I moved an amendment to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill to close a loophole and to ensure that when bad debts are incurred by foreign operations of Australian money lenders and they are written off, they are not being used for tax avoidance purposes. Senator Kemp did not seem to worry much about the tax avoidance possibilities of that legislation because he voted against that amendment, as did his colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the same day, a Democrat amendment was moved to remove tax deductibility for advertising expenditure for alcohol and tobacco. Clearly, Senator Kemp had never read nor heard that the annual expenditure dealing with the consequences of the use of tobacco and alcohol is reaching something like $12 billion. Once again, he did not think that that was a worthwhile amendment to support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 15 April, the Democrats opposed the second reading of the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) as the Bill reduced sales tax on luxury cars, no doubt Ferraris. We called it an extraordinary decision in a recession. But, once again, Senator Kemp thought that our stance did not merit the support of either him or his colleagues. The list goes on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 13 May 1991, a disallowance motion moved by the Democrats to the Austudy scheme which rejected regulations concerning the assets test to the family farm and small business assets, suggesting that they should not be included, was again not supported. Obviously, Senator Kemp and his colleagues are not concerned about the plight of farmers and small business people when they are trying to give their children an education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 17 June, the Democrats moved amendments to the Telecommunications Bill to allow individuals or organisations to take direct legal action in the public interest in the event of any breaches in the legal code. It would seem that Senator Kemp and his colleagues did not think it worthy of support that individuals should be able to take legal action in the public interest. I wonder why. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is more. An amendment was moved on 18 June 1991 to Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) to increase the rate of withholding tax on interest earned by non-residents when the arrangement is believed to be for tax avoidance purposes. The losses to public revenue that these arrangements are being put to have been well and truly documented by taxation academic Barbara Smith. A parliamentary committee, which published a report very colourfully named <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Follow the Yellow Brick Road</EMPHASIS> recommended that this was worthy of further investigation because clearly there were substantial revenue losses. However, once again, Senator Kemp and his colleagues did not seem to worry much about tax avoidance or the losses to public revenue because they chose to vote with the Government against the Democrat amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In deference to the advancing hour, I shall stop at this point. I advise Senator Kemp and his colleagues that I have many more such examples where the evidence of the Opposition voting with the Government against the interests of ordinary Australians, against the public interest and against the Democrats is well and truly on the record. He might like to look at the substance of his voting record rather than at pure numbers, which no doubt take a lot of fine study to accumulate but which mean very little. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a few remarks in the adjournment debate; they will be fairly brief in view of what Senator Sid Spindler has pointed to as the somewhat late hour. Firstly, I thank Senator Spindler for the courtesy of informing me that he was about to attack me in the Parliament. I appreciate the courtesy, but I am not sure whether I was attacked. Senator Spindler has demonstrated once again that it is always very dangerous in this Parliament to read out a speech which has been prepared by one's research staff without looking closely at it. It is a very dangerous practice and Senator Spindler should have been more careful this evening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can understand that Senator Spindler is sensitive about this issue. He is sensitive because he has been one of the driving forces in the Democrat party room which has led the Democrats down this dead end. Compared with virtually all his colleagues, it is Senator Spindler who has encouraged the Australian Democrats to adopt consistently these astonishingly Left wing positions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have referred to Senator Spindler before. I said that he should be classified by the National Trust as the sole surviving Marxist in any parliament in any country on any continent in this world. I always like to hear Senator Spindler speaking because he is one of the sole survivors of the 1950s and 1960s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Spindler must bear a very heavy responsibility for the quite dramatic figures which I tabled in the Senate last night. It is not surprising that Senator Spindler came into the chamber this evening to make some comments. I was surprised that Senator Coulter, whom I advised last night that I was about to make some statements on the voting record of the Australian Democrats, did not come in here to defend himself. I do not know why he sent in Senator Spindler but when Senator Coulter reads the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> he will undoubtedly feel that he was comparatively ill-served. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why has this whole thing emerged this evening&mdash;on Wednesday night when all of us feel it is appropriate that we leave comparatively early? Last night I tabled some pretty dramatic figures in this chamber. I repeat that in 216 divisions of the thirty-sixth Parliament which have occurred since March 1990 the Australian Democrats have supported the Government. By contrast, on 34 occasions they have supported the coalition. That is a pretty fine record for a Party that wants to portray itself to the community as some sort of centrist party and some sort of honest broker between the major parties. Senator Spindler is acutely sensitive about this. That is why he has come into the Senate this evening and decided to make a bit of a fuss about it. He has made only a bit of a fuss; I do not think he scored too many points. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point I wish to make&mdash;having pointed to the Australian Democrats' dreadful voting record in divisions&mdash;relates to the number of Bills in the last two years that the Australian Democrats have enabled to be forced through this Parliament without any significant debate. Some 111 Bills in all&mdash;roughly one-quarter of the legislation which has gone through this Senate&mdash;have been forced through with the cooperation of the Australian Democrats. And this is the party that holds itself out as wanting to make governments more accountable to the Parliament! It is a dreadful record and Senator Spindler has cooperated in that rather appalling record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point I wish to make is this: I would have thought that any party that wanted to improve standards in the Parliament and encourage more effective Government accountability to the Parliament would have been one of the strongest supporters of the reforms to Question Time that we proposed as little as three weeks ago&mdash;and also of the procedure of moving to take note of Ministers' answers after Question Time to force them to be more accountable. But because Senator Spindler is the sole surviving Marxist in any parliament in any country on any continent in this world, he has convinced his colleagues that somehow because we on the Opposition benches want this accountability, because we want Question Time to function in a more traditional manner, as all other governments have decided, and because we wanted to ensure that Ministers were accountable for their answers through the</PARA>
<PARA>procedure of taking note of the answer, they  should block those major reforms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In deference to my colleagues who undoubtedly wish to go home, I will conclude on this point: Senator Spindler will now pay a very heavy price for forsaking his heritage and adopting procedures which do not increase the authority of the Parliament but diminish it. </PARA>

This  coupled with substantially improved systems for delivery of the Bank's services, has been trend, reflected in a reduced need for staff in branches. There has also been a move away from performing a number of ancillary activities in the larger branches, e.g. on-site data processing and market liaison (money market, foreign exchange market and banking liaison in Melbourne) in favour of handling these from Head Office. Apart from impacts of some centralising of activities, these changes have also been reflected in the reduction in staff numbers in related areas of the Bank's Head Office.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Given that program standards TPS10 of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal state that `explicit depiction of sexual acts' are not suitable for television, why did the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal rule that the program `Sex' hosted by Sophie Lee on Channel 9 on Thursdays at 8.30 p.m., which contains excerpts from `R' or `X'-rated films, naked couples, groups and animals involved in explicit intercourse and a close-up of an erect penis, should be allowed to be shown on television with an `AO' rating.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator Collins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The answer to this question requires an understanding of the limits upon the ABT's power to approve individual programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Broadcasting Act, 1942 gives the ABT the power to determine program standards for commercial television. The Act also requires that licensees comply with these standards as a condition of their licence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABT has determined program standards, which require licensees to classify all programs according to the times of the day they may be shown and the audience for which they are suitable. Television Program Standard 10 (TPS 10) sets out the criteria which licensees are to use in classifying programs. The criteria relate to the depictions in programs of violence, sexual activity, drugs and the use of offensive language.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The criteria provide licensees with general guidelines as to the type of content which is acceptable in the classifications&mdash;`G', `PGR', `AO' and `Not Suitable For Television'. The criteria are not designed to be an objective list of unacceptable content, but recognise the assessment of content and context involved in classification.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABT does not classify or approve programs for broadcast. It is specifically prevented by the Act from requiring licensees to submit programs to it for approval, except in the area of children's television standards. The ABT can, however, investigate compliance with standards once a program has been broadcast.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABT has the power to investigate a broadcast and to decide, after holding a comprehensive public inquiry, that the broadcast did not comply with a standard. However, while there are penalties the ABT can impose for non-compliance with a program standard, these penalties do not include the power to require programs not to be broadcast.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of the series `SEX', the ABT reacted to complaints about the first episode by calling for a tape and viewing it. After doing this the ABT decided that the particular episode in question was not inconsistent with the classification standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This decision did not amount to an approval for the classification of all future episodes, because that is not a power the ABT possesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABT has continued to monitor complaints about the series and has viewed all episodes broadcast. It does not propose to take any further action at this stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More importantly, the issues surrounding the content of the series have been considered by the ABT in its inquiry into the classification standards. This inquiry commenced some time before `SEX' began to be transmitted and is the first major review of these standards for some decades.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inquiry has provided for an extensive consideration of the standards and the classification system. It has taken note of considerable public submission on the issues, including all the complaints about the program `SEX'. It has considered whether the current system is meeting community safeguards in this area, including how the licensees have been applying the classification system. The inquiry has also undertaken research into community attitudes towards the matters dealt with by the standards and current community knowledge of the classification system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The transition of the ABT to the ABA means that this inquiry will not result in the variation of the existing standard. However, the ABT inquiry will provide the ABA and the television industry with considerable information to assist in the development of codes of practice in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The research referred to appears to be a survey by Newspoll, "Study of Children's Viewing 1988", commissioned by the ABT as part of its Children's Television Standards inquiry in 1988.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The research was conducted with children aged between 6 and 13, based on a questionnaire which included the question, "When did you finish watching TV after tea last night?" The children were given 5 options to answer this question:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">1. I didn't watch TV</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">2. Before 8.30</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">3. Between 8.30 and 9.30</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">4. Between 9.30 and 10.30</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">5. After 10.30</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The results showed that approximately 50% of children surveyed either did not watch television or finished viewing before 8.30 p.m. Significantly, the wording of the options was such that children who finished viewing at 8.30 p.m. were forced to indicate option 3 above (Between 8.30 p.m. and 9.30 p.m.).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The research actually indicated that at some point between 8.30 p.m. and 9.30 p.m. in Melbourne and Brisbane in 1988, 32.7% and 28.6% respectively of 9 year olds finished viewing. The likelihood is that they finished viewing closer to 8.30 p.m. than 9.30 p.m.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is supported by ratings data which shows a dramatic decline in viewing by children after 8.30 p.m. In the case of the series `SEX', children aged 5-12 comprised 2-4% of the total audience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that some children continue to watch television beyond 8.30 p.m., when `AO' programs are more likely to be shown. Whether the level of child viewing at this time and the extent of community concern is sufficient to warrant a change in the `AO' time zones is something the ABT will report upon at the end of its classification inquiry.</PARA>
