<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make the following statement to the Senate concerning my contact with Mr Greg Symons, following recent publicity about the matter. I returned to the Senate on Monday, 4 May 1992, having been absent during the previous sitting week. The two questions which were asked in the Senate concerning Senator Richardson's contacts with Mr Greg Symons&mdash;one on Monday, 4 May and then one on Wednesday, 6 May&mdash;caused me to recall that I had met Mr Symons last year, but I did not at that time connect that meeting with the matters which were then being raised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 7 May, the last day of sitting, a question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Evans, concerning dealings between Mr Symons and the Australian Embassy or consulates in the United States, prompted me to recall that I may have done something to put Mr Symons in contact with the Australian Embassy in Washington. After Question Time I asked my staff to conduct a search for any relevant information. Due to pressure of business we were not able to return to the matter on 7 May. On 8 May my staff informed me that a letter from me to Mr Chris Lamb, Congressional Liaison Officer, Australian Embassy, Washington, had been located, and a copy of the letter was provided to me on the following day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was then clear to me that, in view of the question which was asked in the Senate on 7 May, I should make a statement to the Senate on the matter on the next day of sitting. On 13 May the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) asked me to provide to him a statement on my contact with Mr Symons, in view of the publicity then being given to Senator Richardson's contact with him. As the Prime Minister's press statement on that day indicated, he is not in a position to require me to provide such a report, but I agreed to do so to assist him in his consideration of the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bearing in mind my responsibility to the Senate, I contacted all party leaders and Independent senators at the first opportunity to advise them that I would be reporting to the Prime Minister. I provided the report to the Prime Minister on 15 May and shortly afterwards I provided the report and the attached documents to the leaders of the parties in the Senate and the Independent senators. I also made the report and attachments public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 21 May I learnt that an acknowledgment of my letter of 20 November to Mr Lamb had been received on 10 December. This acknowledgment, which had not been shown to me, was incorrectly filed and was therefore inadvertently omitted from the original report. As a result, a change needed to be made to the report as shown in the attached documents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have set out these matters in some detail in order to assure the Senate that I have been mindful of my obligation to report to the Senate on my knowledge of this matter, and I am now doing so at the first available opportunity.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing both the Minister for Finance and the Treasurer. I refer the Minister to the acknowledgment by the Minister for Finance last week of the problems which the devastating Budget deficit blow-out poses for the Keating Government's economic strategy for re-election. Does the Minister categorically rule out any increase in existing taxes, or the introduction of any new taxes, to fund the cuts in income tax promised in the `One Nation-One Job' statement?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Short has raised an issue which, of course, has received some fairly public discussion in recent weeks. The Government itself has already acknowledged that the Budget deficit for 1991-92 has changed and the starting point for 1992-93 is higher than anticipated earlier. I must say that I am repeating what Mr Willis said, in a sense, by saying that the reasons for these higher deficits are well known. The important thing to note is that they are not due to any blow-out in government expenditure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the larger deficits forecast for 1991-92 and 1992-93 have implications for the magnitude of the starting point for next year's Budget, the Government reaffirms its commitment to return the Budget to surplus by 1995-96. This will be done at the same time as we deliver the tax cuts promised in the One Nation statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose the key part&mdash;if there was one&mdash;of Senator Short's question asked whether I would categorically rule out any increase in existing taxes. The answer to that question is yes. The Government has no plans to change the taxation regime which has been announced. However, Senator Short may be able to quibble at any time if there is some slight increase in some tax or other charge, so I want to be careful about the answer I give. I think the answer I would give relating to that is that Senator Short should await the Budget in August, because in any Budget there are sometimes small increases in taxes and charges, or reductions in taxes and charges, and the Government, of course, requires that flexibility in any Budget year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I noted that the Minister&mdash;if I got him right&mdash;said in his answer that the Government had no plans to vary or increase the existing tax regime. That is very different from answering my question, which was: will he give a commitment that the Government will not increase existing taxes or introduce any other new taxes to fund the cuts in income tax that were promised in the Government's 26 February statement? I ask him that again: will he rule out any such increases?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce and Minister representing the Treasurer to press reports that the banks are reducing their interest rates for business loans in Australia.

Further, can the Minister suggest to the Senate what effect the reductions in interest rates will have on business conditions in Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Again, there has been a lot of comment in the press about this issue, particularly in the last few days. There have been reports in the press, which have been confirmed by the Government, that Westpac, the State Bank of New South Wales and the National Australia Bank are engaged in intense competition for business customers. This week, Westpac and the State Bank of New South Wales have both reduced their business reference rates by two percentage points. Both these banks have announced business reference rates of 8.75 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The action by these banks has been prompted by the move last week by the National Australia Bank to target business borrowers&mdash;a strategy which the Government welcomes. The National Australia Bank has set aside a $1 billion fund for lending to small and medium sized businesses. Its reference rate is as low as 8.25 per cent. The State Bank of New South Wales has said that it will commit $500m to its plan to target the small and medium business sector. Both these moves have to be welcomed in an environment in which there has been a shortage of capital, particularly for small and medium sized businesses. I expect and hope that the Commonwealth Bank and the ANZ Bank will soon be forced to match these offers, as will the smaller banks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lowering of business interest rates reflects further dividends from the progress that has been made in reducing inflation and inflationary expectations. The progress on inflation means that lower interest rates are sustainable. CPI inflation is now down to 1.7 per cent, which is below the latest average annual inflation rate of 2.5 per cent for major OECD trading partners. The underlying rate, excluding volatile and seasonal factors, is now down to between 2.5 per cent and 3 per cent. This is the lowest underlying rate since the index was first calculated in 1971.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason interest rates are back down to the levels of the 1970s is that inflation is now back below the levels of the 1970s, and the Government intends to keep it there. I suspect that this is one of the reasons for Dr Hewson's intemperate attack on a Reserve Bank official last week. Any good news is unwelcome to the Leader of the Opposition. In a quite bizarre reversal of traditional practice, the bearers of good news are to be put to the sword by Dr Hewson, apparently, in support of&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Hill has invited me to use my imagination rather than reading that line. I will in a minute. If Question Time goes for two hours I will have plenty of time. As Alan Wood commented in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> today, the Leader of the Opposition is clearly a worried man; and why would he not be with the GST and industrial strife packages increasingly being seen as the millstones they are? I do not want to read what Alan Wood wrote, but I refer honourable senators opposite to what he wrote. I think they should read it; it is quite instructive. Senator Walters, in particular, should read it if she can. She might learn something from it. With regard to the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank, let me repeat what he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While I doubt it is possible to achieve a major reduction in inflation without a contraction in output, it is possible to have a recession that has little or no favourable impact on inflation.</PARA>
<PARA>That is an issue which we debated in the Senate a couple of weeks ago. Opposition senators will recall that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and Opposition Treasury spokesman had said that low inflation outcomes were always produced by a  recession. That is a proposition which is demonstrably false and was demonstrably false at the time of the recession induced by the Fraser Government when interest rates and inflation were both at record high levels at the same time.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Bishop will recall the reason why I declined to assist her on 7 May. I spelt that out at some length in the supplementary exchange we had after Question Time, which appears in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> at page 2460. The reason of course, as I stated to her then, was that the question as asked of me raised on its face no obvious question of public affairs, nothing justifying the kind of fishing expedition or dragnet expedition that she was inviting me to undertake. I said that, until such time as I got some foundation for pursuing such an investigation, I would not do so. That is the basis, of course, on which I responded to her question then, and that response remains an entirely credible one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The course of events that occurred which led to these various matters coming to light was as follows: my office was, of course, monitoring Question Time when Senator Bishop's question was asked of me. My senior adviser rang the Department and asked whether it had any knowledge as to what Senator Bishop might be on about. He asked that question of the South Pacific branch of the Department, that being the one associated with the Marshall Islands. The officers in the Department in question said that there may be something in the records; they had some recollection of it. They, as a result, went back to their material and faxed across to my ministerial office a bundle of papers, which I then saw when I returned to my office&mdash;I had no previous knowledge of it&mdash;around about 4 o'clock on 7 May.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those papers included specifically Senator Sibraa's letter to Mr Lamb in our Embassy in Washington and immediately, as a result, raised the possibility that there had been such a contact between Mr Symons and the Washington Embassy, if not necessarily any other US mission of ours. It being at that stage night-time in the United States, it was not possible to follow up then and there with the US&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was the middle of the night in the United States, and, the next morning, Australian time, being business hours in the United States, a phone call was made from my Department to Mr Lamb in Washington which elicited the information that yes, indeed, Senator Sibraa's letter had been followed up; there had been an exchange between Mr Lamb, Mr Symons and a Mr Paul Finch a few days afterwards; that Mr Lamb had, as a result of that exchange, advised them that there was nothing that the Australian Government could usefully do to assist them directly and that they should pursue the matter themselves; and they were given some United States officials' phone numbers to follow up in that respect. That was where the matter rested so far as Mr Lamb and the Washington Embassy were concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I then was told of this on Friday, the 8th. I asked my office to get the Department to put all of that in memo form and, when the memo was received, I asked that it pass that on to the Prime Minister's office, to discuss the handling of the question with the PM's office and, if anything else needed following up, then to follow it up. That is the instruction I left behind me as I left Canberra on Friday afternoon to go back to Melbourne, from where I left for overseas on the following day, the Saturday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such a follow-up did in fact occur in the course of consultations over the next few days and, as will be recalled, the Prime Minister on the 13th&mdash;the following Wednesday&mdash;did in fact set in train a formal report from Senator Richardson and Senator Sibraa. In the context of that process, some further following up was done by my Department with Washington and, indeed, other US consulates, just to ensure that there had been no other point of contact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Lamb was asked to produce not just an oral account of what had occurred, but to forward a memo, which he duly did. Mr Lamb, who by that time had, of course, gone back to his files and not just relied on memory in responding orally, discovered the particular document&mdash;the apparent memo from Mr Symons to Senator Richardson. Mr Lamb attached that to his memo and sent it back to Australia that week, 15 May, under cover of his own memo dated 14 May.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was on that basis that, for the first time, this material&mdash;that particular memo&mdash;came to the attention of my Department. I am happy to table the memo to which I am referring&mdash;the memo that was sent from Mr Lamb back to the Department&mdash;together with its attachments, being the memo in question from Symons to Richardson and also a copy of the letter that Mr Lamb wrote on 4 December.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think, Mr President, that explains the sequence of events. I had no knowledge whatsoever of any documentation bearing upon this matter at the time that I answered the question as I did in the Senate. The mere asking of that question generated a course of events which I have described now in full. It produced the documentation to which I have referred and that is really about the extent of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I am on my feet&mdash;lest there be any question arise of me having misled the Senate in any possible respect in this matter&mdash;might I say that there are a couple of further documents which turned up in the course of the Department's research into this matter. As honourable senators would expect, the Department has been very assiduously researching it in the run up to this week. That was a file note and a fax cover sheet dated 6 April in the Department's records which indicate that my senior adviser was advised by a departmental officer by telephone back on 6 April that two Australian citizens, namely Symons and Finch, had been arrested and charged with forgery in the Marshall Islands and that there were rumours that Senator Richardson had phoned the RMI Government about that matter&mdash;unsurprising rumours, since in fact he had around that day, as everyone knows.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the note indicates that in the context of this call there had been reference to Symons's contact with the Washington Embassy and that the Department had, moreover, faxed across to my office six bits of paper&mdash;a Marshall Islands news report about the arrests and the same five documents that the Department later faxed to me on 7 May. Those documents were a memo from Washington covering the Sibraa letter, the attachment to the Sibraa letter and an exchange of faxes with our Ambassador in Pohnpei.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, my answer on 7 May would have been different&mdash;it certainly should have been different&mdash;if I had been aware of any of that material and any of the contact with my office that that file note implies. But I was not aware of it. My senior adviser has only the barest recollection of the conversation in question on 6 April except as it related to the arrests. He has no recollection whatsoever of seeing any of the faxed documents. My office has no record of those faxes, and a thorough search has failed to turn them up. I was not advised of the conversation, let alone saw any of the documents that might have been sent following it. Lest there be any disposition to get excited about any of this, I asked my senior adviser to swear a statutory declaration as to these matters, which he has duly done, which I now table and seek leave to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I, Miles Kupa, Public Servant, of 94 Schlich Street, Yarralumla, in the Australian Capital Territory, do solemnly and sincerely declare that the following sets out my recollections of when and how I became aware of the contact in November 1991 between the Australian Embassy in Washington and Mr Greg Symons:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. On the afternoon of 7 May, after Senator Evans had told Senator Bishop in the Senate, in response to a question, that he was not aware of any dealings between Symons and the Australian Embassy or consulates in the United States, I telephoned Mr O'Leary, AS SPB in the Department, to establish if the Department knew of any such dealings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. Mr O'Leary replied that there may have been such dealings, in Washington. Senator Sibraa had written to the Embassy to ask if it could facilitate meetings for Mr Symons in Washington. A copy of this letter had been sent by the Embassy to the Department at the time. In the context of a telephone conversation with me in early April (Note: 6 April), about Mr Symons's court appearance in the Marshall Islands, he had mentioned the possibility of a meeting between Mr Symons and the Washington Embassy and had referred to the Sibraa letter. He had then faxed some documents about the Symons case, including a copy of Senator Sibraa's letter, to this Office.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. In response I said that I had had no memory of this early April conversation, other than that it related to Symons's court case, but that, while he had been talking about Washington to me, a recollection of some reference on his part to a Symons-Washington connection in the earlier conversation had come to me. However, I did not recall him having referred at that time to a letter from Senator Sibraa. Nor did I recall seeing a copy of such a document, which I thought I would have. I asked Mr O'Leary to undertake a check of his Branch's files and to send copies of the documents relating to the possibility of contact between Mr Symons and the Washington Embassy to me as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. Mr O'Leary undertook to do so and later that afternoon the documents (copies attached, marked A to F), including a copy of Sibraa's letter, were sent to the Office and I received them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5. I have no recollection of seeing the documents, including the Sibraa letter, prior to their receipt in the Office on the afternoon of 7 May.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6. I conveyed the documents to Senator Evans later that afternoon, after his second exchange with Senator Bishop in the Senate. I had not informed Senator Evans earlier of my 6 April conversation with O'Leary&mdash;Senator Evans was overseas from 5-12 April&mdash;and there was no information given to Senator Evans by this Office (or to my knowledge by anyone else) that would have made him aware of a possible Symons contact with Washington before he answered Senator Bishop's question on 7 May.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. It occurs to me that the Minister protesteth too much. In my supplementary question I want to ask him about three points. His answer, obviously, by implication said that the Prime Minister took a full week before he initiated the search that the Minister refused to undertake. Secondly, the Minister's answer to my supplementary question of 7 May about whether he would investigate and report to the Senate was:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not unless the honourable senator gives me some rational ground for doing so.</PARA>
<PARA>I took note of the Minister's answer and pointed out that he had taken the same tack with regard to Brian Burke. On his own admission, the Minister has now said that on that day he had received information relating to that question. He knew it was the last day of the sitting and he ought to have come back to this Parliament and made us aware of it on that day or that night. Quite frankly, to say that he had to rush off to Cambodia or the like will not do. My supplementary question is: will the Minister table all those papers that contain the President's letter that was sent to the Minister on 7 May, as he stated? Will he also explain to us why he did not report to the Senate on that day? Furthermore, will he explain to us why it was the Prime Minister that had to initiate that further investigation and the Minister simply washed his hands of it like Pontius Pilate?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Bishop would stop fulminating and listen for a moment, she would have heard me give essentially the answers she seeks to those questions. I only became aware when I went back to my office around 4 o'clock that there was some possible foundation for her question. She certainly had not given me any foundation herself either in asking the original question or in her subsequent contribution to the debate. With the utmost respect, references to Mr Burke or anyone else do not constitute the kind of rational foundation for an inquiry of the kind that I was reasonably seeking.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I got back to my office I discovered that there was what appeared to be a letter from Senator Sibraa to Mr Lamb, together with an attachment, which sought Mr Lamb's assistance for Mr Symons on this matter. Neither that letter nor any other document then available to me on its face indicated that any contact with Washington had occurred. That was a matter that needed to be checked out. I have just explained that&mdash;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It may not do for Senator Bishop, but I am explaining why it was that there was no basis for me to come rushing in and say, `Goodness gracious me, there may have been some contact after all'. The possibility of a contact was obviously raised by the existence of Senator Sibraa's letter. Obviously that is what Senator Bishop was on about, and obviously that is what now needed to be followed up. So it was followed up. But it could not be followed up in the middle of the night. Even Senator Bishop would acknowledge that it would be a trifle unreasonable to get someone out of his or her bed. Later that afternoon was the middle of the night Washington time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So a phone call was made on 8 May&mdash;the next day our time at the opening of business hours in Washington&mdash;by my Department asking what had happened and whether Senator Sibraa's letter had been followed up. The answer was received from Mr Lamb, who was in fact home at the time&mdash;not in his office with the material around him&mdash;yes, there had been contact; he described basically the nature of that contact and that he had responded as I have described.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That matter was reported to me orally during the day on Friday, 8 May. I said that it would be appropriate to put all that in memo form. That had not occurred by the time I left for the airport around 4.15 on Friday afternoon. I left behind me instructions that the memo, when it came across from the Department, with all the appropriate documentation attached to it, be sent to the Prime Minister's office, and to Senator Richardson's office for his information, and that any further following up that was thought necessary by my office, in consultation with the Prime Minister's office, be carried out. At that stage I went back to Melbourne and overseas, where I have been up until last night when I got back here. The following up did occur. It occurred with all deliberate speed.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, Mr President. I have described its content accurately enough. In that respect, quite a large number of documents have accumulated, particularly in the context of the arrests of the two Australian citizens, the subsequent consular advice and assistance, of an entirely normal kind, that has been given to them, and in relation to matters going to the substance of the charge that these particular gentlemen are facing in the Marshall Islands. There are documents about that. There are documents on file about the export market development grant which raise questions of statutory confidentiality, and there is a small number of documents relating to the Washington matter and some immigration matters in which my Department was very marginally involved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not going to respond to requests to table every one of those documents because there are very real difficulties about doing so. In particular, documents that go to the question of these arrests and the consular issues that relate to them raise very squarely questions of privacy, confidentiality and interference with the course of justice. It just so happens to be the case that the file note in question is overwhelmingly about the circumstances and the nature of the arrest and the consular matters relating to these particular individuals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be appropriate to release the documents on FOI or other grounds; it may be that no questions of prejudice or whatever arise. But it is a matter for careful evaluation and there simply has not been the time to give these sorts of documents that kind of evaluation. So I am certainly not responding negatively. I am acknowledging, however, quite frankly, for the record, that there is a file note saying that my office was given the gist of this message from Pohnpei and I responded in the way that I have had to when confronted with the existence of that note.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister for Industrial Relations aware of the survival plan for the ANM Mill at Boyer in Tasmania which was drawn up by agreement between management and employees? Does this survival plan depend, among other things, on changes to work practices which were negotiated between management and the unions on site at Boyer? Are these unions basically the same as those operating at APPM in Burnie, where management is refusing to talk to unions and employees about these issues? Can the Minister advise honourable senators why there is such a difference between the industrial relations approach of these two companies and what the consequences of the differences are?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2584" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the first three questions is yes, yes and yes. Australian Newsprint Mills at Boyer faced grave economic difficulties and decided to take a sensible approach by bringing its work force into its confidence about what those difficulties were and by hammering out with its employees a survival plan for the company and for their security of employment as well. This is in stark contrast to the activities of APPM which, at Burnie in northern Tasmania, took a totally different course of action. APPM could be styled as a company with a death wish, or called a company intent on making itself an industrial relations pariah in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to ANM, which is an example of best practice by an Australian company seeking to be world competitive with its product. It has undertaken the necessary restructuring of its operation in order to do so. What did ANM do? It drew up a survival plan in 1985; it injected another $280m of capital investment to upgrade its plant and equipment; it introduced a new management approach&mdash;total quality management; it invested heavily in research and development. It looked at product diversity&mdash;what it sells to the market&mdash;and moved to a higher grade paper products line. It conducted, with its employees, award restructuring and improved the work practices in the company. It introduced a new human resources management approach which emphasised career pathing for employees, skills acquisition and multi-skilling so that the work force could be more flexibly deployed given the advent of new technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It achieved these changes through consultation with its work force. In the early stages there was some dispute over the process and the detail but they have settled down, hammered together and produced a plan which will mean that this company is restructured to put it on a pathway to being one of the world's best, to meet world and global competition and to be relevant to the demands of its market. And it did it harmoniously, in consultation with its employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the questions asked of me was: are these the same unions that are on site at APPM? The answer is yes. There are 11 unions at the ANM works; they are the same unions as at APPM. The significant ones at APPM are the PKIU, MEWU, the ETU and the FEDFA. All of those unions and their representatives have been involved in the survival package at ANM.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In December 1991, ANM was nominated by the Australian best practice panel as a best practice company and supported by me. ANM is now recognised among Australian companies as a model of how to conduct award restructuring and orientate a company to be globally competitive. As I have said, this stands in stark contrast to the high-handed activities of APPM at Burnie. APPM has succeeded in alienating its work force, making war on the community of Burnie and destroying its own economic base as a commercial operation. In fact, it has engaged in an approach to industrial relations&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Kemp interjects in a way favourable to the management of APPM. This simply reflects that both Senator Kemp and APPM are afficionados of the H. R. Nicholls Society and the ultra right wing approach to confrontation in the Australian workplace.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">APPM has not enlisted the support and cooperation of its employees. It has sued a number of its employees at common law and it is claiming damages from them. It has taken a writ of mandamus against the Tasmanian police to require them to take action to arrest the workers. APPM has rejected the cooperative approach that the workers have offered to help restructure the company and it has unilaterally overridden it in a high-handed way. Clearly, this company, which claims to want to talk to its workers, has no interest at all in building a cooperative basis and restructuring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by referring to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Tasmanian</EMPHASIS> dated 26 April 1992 which quoted Ms Julie Fraser, a mother of four, previously uninterested in industrial relations matters, never a member of a union but now an organiser of the Support Pulp Employees Committee, as follows:</PARA>

Is it not a fact that access by the Fitzgerald inquiry was filtered through the discriminatory power of the Commissioner of Taxation and, therefore, could not be likened to ripping off the lid of the Tax Office?

Every year it rates 20 of our top selling cars in a survey carried out with the assistance of the NRMA in New South Wales and Total Quality Ltd. Ranking is based on inspection of vehicle qualities. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Wheels</EMPHASIS> reports what it calls a big surge in quality by Australian car makers, big enough to earn them five of the top 10 positions in terms of automotive quality of cars sold in Australia. I think it is the first time in Australia that that result has been obtained. It confirms the findings of the Automotive Industry Authority in its report on the state of the automotive industry which was tabled in the Senate two or three weeks ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Wheels</EMPHASIS> bases its assessments on examinations of new cars by experts. The Automotive Industry Authority, of course, points out that the customer is the ultimate arbiter of quality, but it bases its comments on the assessments made by car owners several months after they have taken delivery of new vehicles. The Automotive Industry Authority estimated that the quality of Australian made vehicles had improved 27 per cent over the four years to the time of its report recently tabled in the Senate. The report also states that the quality gap between locally manufactured cars and comparable imports has narrowed significantly. In 1991, the quality of seven out of the eight locally produced models improved; the quality of the eighth model remained unchanged.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Documents have been multiplying at a rather rapid rate over the last few days on this subject. They fall basically into four categories. First of all, there are documents relating to Mr Symons's contact with the Washington Embassy in November. I think most of those are now on the public record as a result of the publicly tabled Sibraa and Richardson reports. Also, I have just tabled as an attachment to the statutory declaration which I put down the five documents and a cover note that were sent across from the Department after Question Time on the afternoon of 7 May. There is no document of any substantive significance of which I am aware bearing upon that Washington contact that is not now on the public record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, there are documents relating to a visa application by a contact of Mr Symons submitted to the Australian Embassy in Suva. Questions about that are essentially a matter for the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. They have been dealt with in the context of Senator Richardson's response, his own report. DFAT, my Department, is only very marginally involved in the capacity of the DFAT officer in Suva as a police adviser, but there is some material about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, there are quite a number of documents relating to the arrest of Mr Symons and his colleague, to the current court case in the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the consular assistance provided to him. Among those documents is essentially the file note to which I referred before. The difficulty I have about tabling that is not because of any reference to Senator Richardson. There is a reference in that document to suggestions of Senator Richardson phoning the President and possibly other Cabinet Ministers of the Marshall Islands. There is a reference of that kind in that file note.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, sure. It is just a suggestion coming from our Embassy in Pohnpei which has picked up the rumours and is passing them on to us. Senator Richardson has dealt completely with that. We are not seeking to conceal anything. The problem is that that particular file note also deals with the arrest, the pending court case, a consular matter in relation to it and also a completely unrelated commercial matter dealing with the financial viability of another company. I simply am not in a position, here and now, to table the note. What I am prepared to do&mdash;and I will say this right now, Mr President&mdash;is make available that document to Senator Hill to look at on a private and confidential basis, subject to a proper evaluation of whether it can be released subject to FOI and other confidentiality considerations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is absolutely nothing to hide about the document; it is just that I am obviously constrained by considerations of confidentiality that bear upon many documents that relate to consular matters, private assistance, court cases. There is a whole bunch of documents, about an inch high, which bear upon that and which we simply have not had time to review for their releasability according to those criteria. I hope that honest and fair-minded citizens around the place might appreciate the constraints I am under in that respect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to the final category of documents, as I indicated in passing a few minutes ago there are a number of documents relating to the export market development grant which was paid in 1988 to a company of which Mr Symons was a director and in 1991 to Mr Symons in another corporate guise. Questions will be asked about this later on and we will come to that. But there are questions of statutory confidentiality, statutory secrecy, which inhibit the release of the vast bulk of that material for reasons which ought again to be apparent to honourable senators.</PARA>

Nevertheless, I ask the Minister whether he would prepare a schedule of documents relating to the business affairs of Symons that are being held by his Department. Will he give us reasons in relation to each of the documents that he is not prepared to make public, why he is not prepared to do so? The Minister should understand that these documents are only slowly coming to our attention. For example, Mr President, today for the first time we have learnt that Mr Lamb says that he had a useful session in the Embassy over a fast food lunch with Greg and Paul which aimed at offering them a useful opportunity to size up the possibilities. He goes on to say that they, with the Embassy's help, met the right people. We have learnt that information only today. It seems that there is a lot more still to come.

I raise the matter of financial assistance being granted to former personnel and families of those personnel involved in the British nuclear testing program of the 1950s and 1960s to pursue legal claims against the Commonwealth. In particular, firstly, has the Government granted legal assistance to people involved in claims for compensation against the Commonwealth for damage to their health while carrying out duties on behalf of a government department? Secondly, with reference to the case of William Errol Smith, which is currently before the High Court, in the light of the denial of assistance by both the Western Australian and New South Wales legal aid bodies, has the Government considered making a grant to the widow of William Errol Smith so that she can pursue her action against the Commonwealth?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I regret to advise the Senate that there has been a disturbing increase in the incidence of piracy against shipping in South East Asia, which has now provoked international attention. Along with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I have received representations from the Australian Chamber of Shipping and the Australian National Maritime Association expressing their extreme concern at the situation. Apart from the immediate threat to the safety of the ships' crews, there is also the possibility of a vessel being disabled and, therefore, posing a severe environmental threat. This was demonstrated recently when a fully laden tanker was boarded by pirates. The crew were tied up and the pirates then laid fires in the accommodation area and the engine room of the ship. Fortunately the crew were able to free themselves and extinguish the fire, but not before the vessel had been disabled for some time.</PARA></TALK.START>

A week later the Australian tanker <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Osco Star</EMPHASIS> was similarly raided and the ship's safe was also robbed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development. Is Mr Greg McClelland, the Austrade manager for export incentives, correct when he says that the commercial history of applicants is not considered by Austrade when approving grants for export incentive schemes? If so, why is the business character of a claimant or the historical or ongoing viability of his or her company excluded from the criteria for approving grants? Does the Minister consider that the ongoing viability of a business or company is an appropriate additional criterion?

Finally, is there a need for a review of the scheme in the light of recent events?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the important thing to appreciate about the EMDG scheme is that it is not a qualitative discretionary scheme requiring judgment or assessment of the merits of each particular claim or the commercial entity making the claim at the time it is made. Rather, it is what is described as a quantitative evidentiary scheme characterised by inspection of each claim for `permissible export activity' as that is defined under the Act. In other words, it is just the particular activity on which the expenditure is incurred that is, under the scheme of the Act, subject to scrutiny.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That means that the Act can be administered on a far more mechanical basis and far less administratively intense basis than would be the case if there were some evaluation of the value of the particular activity which is being sought to be financially assisted or if there were also some scrutiny to be made of the commercial worth or viability of the particular company in question. That has been the traditional rationale for the scheme being constructed in the way that it has been, and that has been fully debated in this Parliament, and it seems to have been accepted on that basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, I am told that the administration of the scheme and the way in which the relevant legislation has been drafted are designed to ensure protection against manipulation of the scheme by claimants reorganising their business affairs to obtain undue benefits. Each claim is investigated against the particular qualifying provisions. Section 19 of the Act prevents setting up new business entities to avoid the limiting provisions of the legislation such as the eight-year cut off; and there are other provisions designed to ensure that the maximum grant entitlement of $250,000 is properly administered and applied. From all those mechanical points of view, the Act falls into place and the legislative criteria have their separate role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose the question that does arise and certainly arises with me&mdash;and I have asked departmental officers, and certainly Mr Kerin, to have a further look at this today&mdash;is whether it is appropriate for taxpayers' money to be paid out to a company which is in receivership or liquidation at the time that the payment is made since, on a prima facie view of the matter, such a company is highly unlikely to be contributing much by way of continuing export value. So it seems to me to be a perfectly reasonable question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Act now stands, such a payment has to be made and it is part of the money that can be taken into account by creditors and so on, as there is a statutory obligation to pay it. But that is a reasonable question. I am told that there is quite a complex policy judgment involved in this and it really needs a bit of thinking through. If a company is in receivership, for example, it means that it is still trading and trying to trade out of its difficulties. This kind of government grant can be extremely useful under those circumstances in keeping its viability intact and its capacity to contribute to Australia's export performance alive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, even a company in liquidation may have particular bits of it that are continuing to trade successfully or have that capacity, and again it is not to be assumed, simply because the company itself is in liquidation, that the activity involved will necessarily cease or that the money that would be paid out would necessarily be lost to the Australian taxpayer. All of these things have to be taken into account and will be taken into account in the light of some of the issues thrown up by this case, but for the moment that is the way it works.</PARA>

Does the Australian Government have a role in fostering competitive financing arrangements for the Australian industry?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would hope that the Government could help with that, but not directly as a government. There has been significant restructuring of the shipbuilding industry in Australia. That was done by more focused bounty arrangements, R&amp;D grants, tax concessions, export marketing and training support. In 1982-83 exports of ships totalled $20m, and $5m in the second year. This year exports of ships will account for well over $200m. That has been so for several years. Australia has developed niche markets in a number of types of ships, particularly high speed ferries and luxury cruisers. It now accounts for 10 per cent of the world market in those classes of ships. Some Australian shipbuilders have orders until the turn of the century. As a result of that, shipbuilders are investing in more modern plant, undertaking further R&amp;D and employing more skilled workers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of competitive finance remains one of critical importance in export markets. To date, the Export and Finance Insurance Corporation, EFIC, has been a major source of export financing but the capacity to assist this one sector is limited, particularly in circumstances where buyer demand is enormous. The Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, along with EFIC and a number of leading legal and financial firms, has therefore organised a conference on ship financing which will take place in Sydney this week. The conference will look at some of the more innovative financing arrangements now being used in other markets to see whether they can be used here. This industry is already a success story and there is potential for greater success if the likely growth of demand in Asia and Europe is realised, as we believe it will be. This industry can contribute very much to supplying demand in those markets.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I am aware that the Australian Institute of Criminology&mdash;which is Australia's only national crime research organisation&mdash;has been targeted for abolition by the Opposition in its Fightback package. I must say that the stated reason for its abolition just does not bear any scrutiny at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to indicate that perhaps two or three years ago the Australian Police Ministers Council was sceptical of or had some misgivings about the worth of the Australian Institute of Criminology. But there is no doubt that under the chairmanship of Professor Duncan Chappell the Institute has proved its worth as an adviser to governments and law enforcement organisations throughout Australia&mdash;and, indeed, even overseas&mdash;in a way which leads one to say that its practical advice, the papers it produces, the information it compiles, the way in which it analyses trends in criminal activity in Australia, and the preventative crime measures that it advises on have all been of great worth to law enforcement agencies throughout Australia. Indeed, the various police forces around Australia are amongst the best customers of the Institute's advice and assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The practical character of the advice received is, I think, what makes it particularly attractive to those who actually have to operate within the criminal justice system. The prime example that I am aware of is the activity of the Institute in relation to the National Committee on Violence. It provided the Chair for that very important committee and the various support and secretariat personnel and activity underpinning the work of that National Committee on Violence which has led to the active implementation throughout Australia of very practical measures aimed at reducing the culture of violence in our society. Certainly, the Institute has had a very crucial and central role in the devising and implementation of those measures. Not only government agencies but also the NRMA, the Australian Bankers Association and others have asked for work to be done by the Institute and have been most satisfied with the work that has been undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Institute is a particularly cost effective organisation. In a criminal justice system in which the costs would certainly exceed $3 billion annually, the cost of the Institute is the equivalent to the annual cost of keeping 12 police cars staffed by two police officers on the road for 24 hours per day. Perhaps another equivalent would be the construction of 40 police or prison cells. The opportunity for cost savings within the criminal justice system by abolishing the Institute are not there. The abolition of this Institute would remove a very good source of practical advice for those who have to operate within the criminal justice system in this country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Alston, in the usual open-mouthed policy which he adopts, says this is desperate stuff. As a matter of fact, it is very important stuff and the answer is more important to a diligent questioner like the honourable senator who asked this question than many of the questions being directed today. Magnesium is of course a very strong and light metal&mdash;lighter than aluminium. Demand for the metal will come especially from the motor vehicle industry as part of its efforts to manufacture lighter and more efficient cars. For example, the Japanese motor vehicle industry projections for the use of magnesium by that industry over the next decade go up in a very steep curve.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will answer this question in great length because it will relieve Opposition members of some embarrassment about the growing horror of nothing to think about which they confront. It has been pathetic. The main barrier to realising this technology is the development of a refining process that will produce very high levels of purity in the metal and, of course, it has to be cost efficient. Research by CSIRO has made this prospect feasible and the next step will be a $50m pilot plant based in Gladstone in Queensland which will be funded by the Commonwealth and Queensland governments contributing 50 per cent of the plant's cost and Queensland Metals, CSIRO, Mount Isa Mines Holdings and the Japanese firm Ube contributing the remaining 50 per cent. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the next four years there will be intensive research and development that should lead, at the end of that period, to a bankable feasibility study and thereafter to a world scale magnesium metal plant. The advantage of that for Australia is enormous in light of the very pure and extensive deposit of magnesium ore which this country has. In addition to the very high returns from magnesium metal in terms of value-adding down the chain, this plant can lead to the establishment in Australia of significant downstream industries, just as occurred in previous decades with the aluminium industry. So this is an important question and we look forward to monitoring progress on this important development in Queensland.</PARA>

Do you in fact have anything in written form from Mr Symons that justifies your statement that President Kabua had sought the assistance of the Australian Government?

Shelling, sniper fire and widespread fighting continue. The food situation is particularly serious. Hunger related deaths are beginning to be reported in Sarajevo.

Has the Government considered any safety net for the railway workshop workers in Port Augusta and, if so, what is it? Does the Government have any plans to secure the future of the AN workshops?

Is the Minister aware that, as I discovered last week in New Zealand, the telecommunications competitor in that country, Clear Communications, has a stated policy of not employing former New Zealand Telecom employees? Is the Minister aware of any similar policy on the part of Optus, the Australian competitor? How confident is he that the employment slack will be taken up by Optus?

I am able to provide the honourable senator with some further information at this stage. On 15 May the Prime Minister announced that the Government proposed to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act to put beyond doubt the right of access by the Western Australia royal commission&mdash;and, incidentally, other royal commissions&mdash;to certain information held by the Australian Taxation Office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the official advice to the Government from the Tax Office was that the Western Australian royal commission could gain the necessary access to tax information by way of the process established by the insertion of section 3E in the Act in 1989. Section 3E was introduced after the Fitzgerald Royal Commission and was designed precisely to provide controlled access to tax information by law enforcement agencies. The provisions of section 3E have been utilised by a variety of agencies including, for example, the Western Australian police force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has decided, however, to specifically include within the ambit of section 3E royal commissions in order to remove any doubt or lack of clarity on this matter and, of course, to avoid involving the tax administration in cheap political controversy. It was pertinent to this decision that, despite an express invitation by tax officials to officers of the Western Australian royal commission at the outset to utilise the avenue provided by section 3E, the Royal Commission's officers had reservations about this avenue and declined to use it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to be introduced, I believe today in the House of Representatives, will remove any such reservations, whether or not they are soundly based, and will specifically extend to the Western Australian Royal Commission and other royal commissions prescribed by regulation access to relevant tax information provided for in the provisions of section 3E. They will also allow the Western Australian Royal Commission to disclose the information in a confidential report to the State Governor, and they will allow the Governor to disclose that information to a law enforcement authority and permit the Western Australian Royal Commission to disclose the information to certain persons in private proceedings. The amendments were drafted following consultations with the Western Australian Royal Commission which has advised that they are satisfactory for the purposes of the Commission. All that remains is for the amendments to have timely unimpeded passage through the legislative process.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I raise with you a procedural matter. As you know, honourable senators must speak from the place that is appointed to them. Mr President, I see that, under standing order 48(4), you determine the positions of occupation of seats by honourable senators, other than the front right seats reserved for Ministers. We have had circulated today this plan, which I presume to be your determination of seating, which placed Senator Collins and Senator Colston in the same pair of seats. On this side of the chamber we look forward to the interesting proposition of Senator Colston and Senator Collins sitting together. We wonder as to how one might be able to rise without actually bringing the other one to his feet.</PARA></TALK.START>

I did not want to waste your time during Question Time with this matter, Mr President, but I wonder whether you are going to allow these people to speak from the seats that they have selected or whether you will determine that they must move to the seats that you have chosen for them. </PARA>

I hope it is not deliberate policy, Mr President, that you have seated the two retiring no-hopers from the Liberal Party together&mdash;the ones with foghorn voices, both of whom are retiring from this chamber and making nuisances of themselves. Why is Senator Durack, who is no longer on the front bench, sitting there? It is because he is Deputy Leader and those opposite have to organise a ballot amongst themselves and have not done so yet. Why is Senator Bishop sitting where she is when she tells everyone when she is on overseas trips that she is going to be a Minister in the next Government? How many Ministers will those opposite have to appoint if they are actually going to get to her? They already have 33 shadow Ministers, about nine or 10 parliamentary secretaries and nine whips.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the statement, and expresses its grave concern that the President of the Senate failed to exercise due care in requesting the Australian Embassy in Washington to assist Mr Symons and as a result made false assertions in his request, thus compromising the office of the President of the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, we regard this matter extremely seriously. We do so because of your position, your high office and your responsibility&mdash;not to the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, or someone else, as might be the case, on the other side of the chamber, but to this Senate, to this institution. We expect of you, and we are justified in expecting of you, the highest standards and we expect that, certainly, in the carrying out of your functions, you will exercise all reasonable care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, in this instance when you took it upon yourself to write this request to our Embassy in Washington that help be given to this businessman, Mr Symons, a request that apparently seems to have been made at the beck of Senator Richardson, the then Minister for Social Security, you failed to exercise that due care. Mr President, I note that you sigh, but today you have confirmed what you said previously: that Senator Richardson brought Symons around to you, and the purpose for which he did that was in order that you might facilitate for the benefit of Symons your contacts within the United States. You took it upon yourself to do that by making contact direct with our Embassy in Washington and, in particular, with the Congressional Liaison Officer, Mr Lamb, and you determined to do that by letter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, I do not quarrel with you in fact deciding to assist him. I do not even quarrel with the fact that you decided to do that by making contact with our embassy in Washington direct. What I quarrel with is, first, that you did it in the form of a letter that now has been demonstrated to be factually incorrect; and, secondly, that you should have realised the assertions that were being made by Symons were such that any prudent senator, let alone the President of the Senate, would check out the facts before he put his name to that letter. That was your failure in this instance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, you asserted in this letter that the President of the Marshall Islands had asked Australia for its assistance in this matter, and you signed a letter to that effect without having before you any material upon which you could reasonably come to that conclusion. When you made documents public at the request of the Prime Minister, you made public a series of documents that had been provided by Mr Symons. Those documents certainly tended to indicate that he had some status that had apparently been given to him by the Attorney-General of the Marshall Islands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was nothing in those documents that supported the claim by Symons that the President of the Marshall Islands had asked the Australian Government for its assistance. That is why we say that, at the very least, any reasonable senator would have picked up the phone and checked with the Department to see whether that was the case before putting that in writing and sending off such a letter to America. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In your instance, Mr President, because of your position I would have thought that you would have probably checked it with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade as well, but you did neither. You did not check with the Department or with the Minister. It is even more incredible when the officer from your staff assisting you in this matter is in fact an officer of the Department of Foreign Affairs. That demonstrates even more to me that you would have been put on warning to exercise that care by simply doing a check. However, you did not and you made certain assertions which have turned out to be false. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, when you wrote that letter to America you did not advise the Department then that you had sent the letter; you did not advise the Minister that you had sent the letter; and the total picture&mdash;almost as you have conceded when answering questions in the Senate today&mdash;was that you acted without due care. You have said that you regret that you took Symons at face value, and I acknowledge that concession. I suspect that you were influenced as much by the documents that he had in his possession as you were by the fact that a senior Minister in the Government, Senator Richardson, brought him around to you seeking assistance in this matter. Whatever it was&mdash;whether it was on the basis of the documents that Symons presented to you or for some other reason&mdash;there is certainly no reason that you have put before the Senate that would have justified you writing in such terms. To write in such terms could have in fact caused embarrassment to this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it has. In due course what has occurred has certainly been embarrassing to this country and it is highly unfortunate that you allowed yourself to become enmeshed in this matter, Mr President. Naturally, you would say that with the benefit of hindsight, now that we know more about Symons and his business practices. Nevertheless, even without the benefit of hindsight, you should have been put on warning to do those checks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot imagine any senator writing that letter without checking first with the Department that in fact it is the case. It is such an astonishing assertion that the president of another country had asked the Australian Government for assistance, and thus this person Symons turns up on the President of the Senate's doorstep asking that a letter be written to our Embassy in the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that Senator Sibraa apparently knew Symons from the Young Labor movement some years before and perhaps in some way the fact that he knew of Symons and his background, plus the fact that he had been brought around to him by Senator Richardson&mdash;the senior power broker within the President's faction&mdash;gave the President greater comfort. However, Mr President, you certainly should have learnt from subsequent events that such comfort was falsely placed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation is that your act has compromised your position as President of the Senate and that is something that we on this side of the chamber regard gravely. In fact, we would be tempted to go further. We are on the public record as saying that, if you are going to act without exercising such due care, you will not continue to hold the confidence of this side of the chamber.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When looking at the two situations, the one in relation to Senator Richardson, a former Minister, and the one in relation to yourself, Mr President, the Democrats have imagined ourselves in precisely the same positions and asked the question, `What would we have done under the circumstances?'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seemed to me that if, as you have explained, a senior Minister came into my office, introduced somebody to me, said something like, `I have known this man for 25 years. He is related to me by marriage. Would you help with his introduction in the United States?' and then left the room, and, as a consequence of that, I was then shown a number of documents&mdash;some of which have been circulated to us&mdash;on the letterhead of Ministers from a foreign government and was orally given other information which was consistent with that information, I think I would have done exactly the same as you did, Mr President, and I would have written such a letter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If all honourable senators examine their own consciences and background, each one of us would remember that, given those sorts of circumstances, we have provided references for people without going back and checking. If there was no such corroboration, certainly any reasonable person would have checked and sought corroboration of the evidence before him. With the exception of stating the matter in relation to President Kabua as a fact, as you have already indicated, it would have been far more prudent to have said, `I am informed by Mr Symons that', or words to that effect. But, with that exception, it certainly seems to us that, given that set of circumstances, there was no reason why you should have sought corroboration of that documentation and the oral information that Mr Symons evidently gave you. If one were to seek to check every document, phone call or introduction that comes across one's desk or through one's office, it seems to me that we would not do any work at all. I believe that any reasonable senator, given those circumstances, would have behaved exactly as you behaved, Mr President. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the Democrats came to a very different conclusion in relation to Senator Richardson who was the instigator of that introduction, of course, and was the one who had issued the reference for Mr Symons. He had not only issued a letter of introduction but also a reference knowing full well that Mr Symons was to set up a $40m company in a foreign country. It seems to me that, whether one takes the protestations of ignorance from Senator Richardson at their face value or whether one believes that he had more knowledge than he is admitting to in relation to Mr Symons and his previous business dealings&mdash;</PARA>

In his speech, Senator Hill invited me to explain why we drew that distinction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I was saying, it seemed to me that whether one believed that Senator Richardson had more knowledge than he was admitting to or that he was as ignorant as he claimed, either way his behaviour was not acceptable for a Minister. Consequently, even before his statement went to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and was released publicly, we were saying that it would be extremely difficult to imagine the circumstance contained in his explanation which would adequately explain why he issued the reference and then later interceded with the President of the Marshall Islands on Mr Symons's behalf. Those are the bases upon which we drew that distinction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to your action, Mr President, I think, if anything, it indicates a greater complicity on the part of Senator Richardson rather than any misdemeanour or lack of care on your part.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts are quite straightforward and they are on the record. Senator Richardson introduced Mr Symons to Senator Sibraa. Mr Symons produced a number of documents purporting to show that he had the authority to negotiate on behalf of the Marshall Islands Government. Mr Symons said that he had no contacts in Washington and wanted to contact officials or congressmen with expertise on specific matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A member of Senator Sibraa's staff who was present suggested that Mr Symons should speak to Mr Chris Lamb, a congressional liaison officer in Australia's embassy in Washington&mdash;of course, an officer of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade with whom Senator Sibraa's office had had, as I understand it, long and quite frequent contact. That was the step which the President of the Senate took to involve the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the bureaucracy in this matter. The staff member spoke to Mr Lamb about this in a telephone call which he made to Washington. Senator Sibraa then wrote to Mr Lamb, and a copy of his letter is on the public record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Sibraa, the President, has said two things about this matter. He has said that, with the wisdom of hindsight, his letter could have been worded more carefully. I agree with him about that&mdash;I think it could have been worded more carefully. But in a situation in which one is writing a letter offering an introduction to somebody overseas, as I understand the President of the Senate does and Ministers in this Government do, I would have thought the matter of precise wording is not something which at the time would be paramount in one's mind. Senator Sibraa has already said that it could have been worded more carefully. In the course of answering questions today he has also said that he regrets that he took Mr Symons at face value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the fact remains that the only assistance the President provided to Mr Symons was to refer him to an Australian Government official in Washington. All this talk about damage to the image of the Australian Government and damage to Australia as a result of some activities of Mr Symons and so on just does not take account of that simple fact. The President referred him to an Australian Government Foreign Affairs official in Washington. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the matters I have set out make clear, it was not possible for me to report to the Senate earlier.</PARA>
<PARA>As you make clear in the earlier part of your statement, you were in a position from 8 May onwards to know that the letter from you to Mr Lamb had been located, and you obtained a copy of that letter the following day. It is not at all clear&mdash;you have certainly not explained it in this statement&mdash;why you were not able to clarify that situation and put to rest any misunderstanding that might have been in the public mind by making a public statement. You choose to shelter behind the words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was then clear to me that . . . I should make a statement to the Senate on the matter on the next day of sitting.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not understand for a moment why that should be. You were quite happy to provide material to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) which you knew would be used by him in the public arena and well prior to any resumption of the Parliament, and to ensure that Senator Richardson got his just desserts. When it suited the Prime Minister and yourself, that material was made available for use in the public arena. So there was nothing to stop you clarifying this matter prior to the resumption of the Senate. Yet you chose to do nothing in that intervening period. It may well be that if the Prime Minister had not pre-empted matters, you may not have ever raised the matter again. It is certainly now possible for you to say that that was always your intention; but it certainly does not follow that that was going to happen when you have not explained why you were not prepared to make that statement in public as soon as the matters came to your attention. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems extraordinary that you, Mr President, should again seek to shelter behind the proposition that somehow this sort of reference was something that people do all the time, that therefore it was of no particular consequence to you and no bells were rung. I think it would be very helpful in trying to assess the merits of those assertions to look at the volume of references that you provide and the basis on which they are provided. I find it extraordinary that you can have someone wheeled in in this matter and, on the basis of something that was said to you, make a statement which you now concede was quite untrue. You say that your fault was in taking Symons at face value. It might have been more accurate to say that your problem lay in taking Senator Richardson at face value. But, nonetheless, where is the material that demonstrates that you proceeded to have this reference put together on the basis of what was told to you by Symons? Is there not a note of the conversation with Symons taken by your advisers at the time? I would not expect you to be taking notes of the discussion.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The subsequent follow-up discussion between your senior adviser, Mr Peppinck, and Mr Symons also, one would have thought, would have found its way into written notes, which would again corroborate your now assertion that this false statement was based on matters told to you or your advisers. Where is the evidence to support that? If it is not forthcoming, it suggests that this was really put together on the basis of someone's recollection of what Symons might have said when he was wheeled in. It does not make any difference at all to the state of affairs to claim that somehow he came in with a box of papers which were quite impressive. They are of no use to you when it comes to putting a reference together. You have certain papers that are left with you. They in no way support the contention that the President of the Marshall Islands had sought the assistance of the Australian Government in expediting discussions. The proper place to verify that would have been through our own Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the very least, one would have thought that in putting this reference together someone would either have located information from Symons that was in concrete form or taken a note of what he said over the phone at the time. If neither exists, it simply suggests that somehow you were quite prepared to just put a few words together, careless of the consequences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also find it strange that the letter to Mr Lamb says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I understand that you have already spoken with Greg Symons . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Lamb makes it clear, subsequently, that he does not have any such recollection. He says that subsequent to this undated letter, which he believes arrived with him on about 22 November, he rang Mr Peppinck. But you go on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . who as you know, is an adviser to the President of the Republic . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The words `as you know' suggest that Mr Lamb had previously been put in the picture about Symons. In other words, prior to that letter being written, someone had been in contact with Mr Lamb. Either it was you in person or it was your adviser. But, in any event, and particularly in view of the fact that the matters were followed up by Mr Peppinck in phone calls to Washington&mdash;one would assume that that is not an everyday occurrence&mdash;it seems extraordinary that you can dismiss Symons as simply a name that did not ring any bells until much later in the piece. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would have thought that you, Mr President, only had to be half awake in this chamber to have very much recognised the name `Symons' and to have been very much aware of precisely what had happened, rather than saying that you were merely prompted to recall that you may have done something to put Symons in contact with the Australian Embassy. That seems to me to suggest that you knew precisely what you had done in relation to Symons and you also knew that you needed to put inquiries in train, which you did. You say it was due to pressure of business. It was not clear what that business was or why it should have taken priority over the prospect that you may have cause to make a very early explanation to Senator Evans, who had otherwise unwittingly misled the chamber. In all the circumstances, one would have thought that that was the highest political priority. Yet you did not do that. You simply allowed the letter to be finally provided to you on the following day and then sat back and did nothing over the period prior to the Prime Minister blowing Senator Richardson out of the water. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not just any ordinary reference; it is a glowing testimonial which one would find it very difficult to believe would be provided to the average ordinary citizen who might have been brought in, even by a senior Cabinet Minister. The irresistible inference has to be that because of Senator Richardson's unique status in the tribe, anything that anyone was prepared to say in support of their own case or reference, if they were brought in by Senator Richardson, was good enough for you. I would have thought that that is very much a breach of the duty of care that you owe to this chamber and, indeed, to the citizens of Australia when you are from your high office seeking to make representations on behalf of a person who has come to see you. As you would now concede, it caused you to mislead a senior official in the Australian Embassy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all those circumstances, it is simply not good enough for Senator Coulter to say, `Well, of course, if we were all put in the situation, we would all do the same thing'. The facts of the matter are that this was not just any ordinary low level citizen wanting a low grade piece of paper. This was someone who was in an extraordinary situation, brought in by a unique individual and asking you to make representations at the highest levels. In those circumstances, I think you need to explain in much greater detail why you said that somehow this was a routine matter and that it was not necessary for you to verify the very serious claims that were being made in that undated correspondence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would therefore support Senator Hill in his expression that you, Mr President, have failed to exercise due care in requesting the Embassy to assist Mr Symons, and as a result, false assertions have been made in the request. We do not believe that your explanation is satisfactory. We have tried to make it clear that if the Democrats take the issue of propriety as seriously as they should, they should have no option but to support our motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened very carefully to what Senator Hill said; with the utmost respect, I am not going to listen nearly so carefully to what Senator Walters says because I think she has missed the point of the debate. It may or may not be the case that Mr Symons was an adviser to the President of the Republic of the Marshall Islands; that is something which is presently the subject of a court case in the Marshall Islands. Whether the authority that Mr Symons was holding out was real authority or feigned authority is a matter for the judgment of the courts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is not in doubt and what has not been challenged about Senator Sibraa's behaviour was that he was confronted with documentation which, on its face value, seemed to give Mr Symons that status. We have before us specifically a document purportedly signed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Marshall Islands, Mr Kijiner, conferring upon Mr Symons the status of a consultant to the Marshall Islands Government. We have a further description by Senator Sibraa of other documents having been shown to him which conferred upon Mr Symons the status of someone who was close to, representative of, an adviser to, a delegate of&mdash;use any of the words you like&mdash;the Marshall Islands Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is plenty of evidence, on the information before the Senate, on which Senator Sibraa could reasonably have made the assumption that Mr Symons did have that status. I repeat that whether, in fact, he had that status is not a matter for us to make judgments about, that is a matter for the courts in the Marshall Islands and I certainly do not want to trespass on that.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is one thing about the situation which Senator Sibraa confronted which seems to be beyond doubt&mdash;Senator Sibraa was confronted with someone making a claim to that status which seemed, on the face of it, to be thoroughly reasonably based. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second thing with which Senator Sibraa was confronted was that person, with that apparent status, making a request through Senator Sibraa for Australian Government assistance. Mr Symons made a request to the Australian Government for Australian Government assistance. Mr Symons made that request to Senator Sibraa to put him in touch with the appropriate representative of the Australian Government, namely, Mr Lamb. Mr Symons clearly made a request through Senator Sibraa of the Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we put those two facts together we have a situation where someone purporting to be a representative of, a delegate of, the Marshall Islands Government is making a request of the Australian Government. That is the explanation, if we are fair minded about it, of the particular contested sentence in Senator Sibraa's letter. I will repeat the relevant part of Senator Sibraa's letter. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . President Kabua has sought the assistance of the Australian Government in expediting discussions in Washington. . . </PARA>
<PARA>What that letter should have said is, `President Kabua has, through Mr Symons,'&mdash;and I underline those last three words&mdash;`sought the assistance of the Australian Government in expediting discussions in Washington'. On my understanding of President Sibraa's explanation today, his explanation of what was done and the report he made to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), is why this language is used. There is an implicit phrase missing which would completely explain the context in which this letter was written. If Senator Sibraa had worded the letter more cautiously, as he acknowledges he should have, he would have said that President Kabua has, through Mr Symons, sought the assistance of the Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we read the letter in that way&mdash;fairly, and taking into account the situation that Senator Sibraa confronted&mdash;we will see that what Senator Sibraa made was not, on the face of it, an incorrect statement; not, on the face of it, a statement that should have been checked out with the Foreign Affairs Minister of the Marshall Islands or anyone else. It was simply an incomplete statement; a statement which failed to draw together all the particular linkages that were available to him. That is certainly the way I have read the statement subsequently; it is certainly the way in which I believe that Mr Lamb and the Ambassador in Pohnpei read it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is obviously the case that there was no form of communication with the Australian Government from the Marshall Islands other than through Mr Symons who was the purported representative of the Marshall Islands, but it is not obviously the case that Senator Sibraa should have taken steps more than he did to establish that state of affairs. I repeat, Senator Sibraa was confronted with two factual situations: firstly, someone standing in front of him, armed with a sheath of documentation purporting, on the face of it, totally credibly, to have the status as a full scale representative of the Marshall Islands Government; and, secondly, someone with that status asking him to get some assistance for the Marshall Islands from the Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Sibraa, or the person who drafted the letter on his behalf, simply put those two propositions together in an abbreviated fashion and said, `President Kabua has sought the assistance'. To spell it out clearly, he should have said, `President Kabua has, through Mr Symons, sought the assistance'. If those opposite read the letter in that way they will see that the problem that was generated by Senator Sibraa in writing this letter was not one based on any negligence on his part, and was not based on any error of judgment on his part; it was simply based on, essentially, a drafting infelicity, not spelling things out to the extent that he reasonably should have to avoid any possible doubt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If those opposite are prepared, as Senator Coulter was, to read the letter in that way and understand the situation confronting Senator Sibraa, it should be perfectly apparent that there is no ground at all for expressing concern or censure. Senator Sibraa acted perfectly reasonably on the particular evidence with which he was confronted, on the basis of the apparent status of the person with which he was confronted. I do not honestly believe that any of us in a similar situation&mdash;certainly none of those opposite&mdash;would have behaved differently. For all those reasons, I believe that the Senate should reject this motion. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate take note of the President's statement and expresses its grave concern that the President of the Senate failed to exercise due care in requesting the Australian Embassy in Washington to assist Mr Symons and as a result made false assertions in his request thus compromising the office of the President of the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA>There are seven regrettable aspects to this matter and I would like to deal with them one by one. The first is that the information now made available to this chamber was not made available to senators as quickly as it could have been and, in my view, as quickly as it should have been. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is perfectly simple to send a memo or a written report to a Prime Minister or to any other Minister; it is just as simple to send that information to senators. I say that because, after all, the position that was used to facilitate Mr Symons's getting whatever he did get in the United States was really that of the President; it was not that of an ALP backbencher. My understanding is that the President of the Senate does not actually report to the Prime Minister. So I am amazed that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) received a report from the President of the Senate before senators did. I regret that that has happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My second regret about the matter concerns the factual errors themselves. I understand your position, Mr President. You say that you were provided with numerous documents&mdash;a whole box or bag of documents; a bag of tricks that someone was carting around&mdash;and you now wish that you had all of them in front of you. That may be the case. But from what you have told us today, the letter that you signed later in November was signed on the basis of nothing but your recollections, or the recollections of your staffer, Mr Peppinck, of verbal conversations with Mr Symons. Were that not the case, were there some documentation to support the assertions of fact in the letter which we now know are wrong, you would no doubt have produced those documents. But you do not have them. You have told us that, following your meeting, Mr Peppinck had some discussions with Mr Symons. No doubt, Mr Symons gave him the good snake oil on what ought to be put in the letter. You have either taken Mr Peppinck's word for it or Mr Peppinck has it wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not accept Senator Evans's version of events that this is nothing other than infelicitous drafting. I think that is stretching the bounds of good faith somewhat. The fact is that there are factual errors in the document. They are there because you have signed the document on nothing but the recollections of your staffer's conversations with someone the day you left the country. I think that is regrettable&mdash;absolutely regrettable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third regret that I have in relation to your statement, Mr President, is that you did not attempt to confirm the statements of fact in the letter either with the Department or with any other Minister. We are not talking about a statement such as, `This man has a law degree' or `This man has some other degree'. I have been duped in that respect myself by people claiming to have educational qualifications which they did not have. I am not talking about that. I am talking about assertions that the head of another government has sought this Government's assistance&mdash;something that is well beyond the average thing one would put in a curriculum vitae. I am talking about a statement of fact that would be easily checked with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Both the question of whether President Kabua had sought the Australian Government's assistance and whether Mr Symons was actually an adviser to the President were easily checkable and should have been checked. You should not have relied simply on your memory of a bag of documents and your staffer's memory of a conversation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My fourth regret is that you commenced your memo to the Prime Minister by referring to the fact that Senator Richardson, the then Minister, brought `a Mr Symons' to your office. This is a small regret but, nonetheless, it does give the impression that you had never met Mr Symons before in your life. Were I drafting something and referring to someone whom I knew&mdash;someone who had been in the Labor Party when I was a younger member of the Party; someone who was clearly well known to a number of people in the Labor Party&mdash;I would not have referred to that person as `a Mr So-and-so'. I would have spelt that out. Perhaps it is an oversight. Nonetheless, I regret that, to the extent that it is an oversight, it happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fifth point about which I wish to express some regret is that you start your letter to Mr Lamb, `Dear Chris, I understand that you have already spoken with Greg Symons'. I know that this letter was signed some time after you actually had the meeting with Mr Symons&mdash;I think you went away, came back and the letter was ready for you to sign on a Friday. The letter says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I understand that you have already spoken with Greg Symons. . .</PARA>
<PARA>Unless I have been tardy in reading the material or listening to what you have said, I am unaware of how you became aware that Mr Symons had already spoken to Mr Lamb. I would like to know how, when you signed this letter, you knew that Mr Symons had already spoken to Mr Lamb. I would particularly like to know who told you and what they told you of the conversation that Mr Symons had with Mr Lamb. I would be very interested in having the point clarified: how did you know only a week or two later that the conversation had taken place and what else did you know about it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My sixth regret is that there are other matters on which the document is silent. The document is totally silent on whether Senator Richardson had asked other, perhaps more relevant, people&mdash;that is, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans)&mdash;to make arrangements for Mr Symons. Were I in your position, Mr President, and someone came to me and asked for some sort of helpful introduction to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Washington or elsewhere, my first question would be&mdash;partly because of the position that I would hold and partly because of wanting to be of greatest benefit to the person seeking assistance&mdash;`Why doesn't the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade write such an introduction and reference?'. The documents are silent about whether you in fact asked these questions of Senator Richardson or why, as the President of the Senate, you were being sought after as the person to write this introduction rather than a Minister of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, your documentation is silent on whether Mr Peppinck raised this matter with you on your return to the chamber on 4 May. I understand that your document says that on your return on 4 May there were a couple of questions asked about this. Actually, if you include all the questions, there were seven asked in the week that you returned. It was only when the question by Senator Bishop was asked about the use of the embassy or consulate in the United States that the penny actually dropped that perhaps something needed to be checked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, I think this begs the question. Presumably, Mr Peppinck is not incompetent; he has some experience in foreign affairs. This matter was raised in the week when you were away and it was raised six or seven times during the week that you returned. Mr Peppinck has a decent understanding of foreign affairs. He certainly had some understanding of the degree to which this issue was growing. Your documentation is silent as to whether Mr Peppinck said anything. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not for me to offer you advice about what you should do. But I can tell you what I would do if someone from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade working for me had allowed a matter like this to brew for a week when I was away and allowed it to continue to brew for a week once I was back. I can tell you what I would do if I had someone working for me who had assisted in the meeting, had a conversation the following day with Mr Symons, reported back to you, and presumably drafted the letter that contains these factual errors. This was only in November. We are not talking about something in 1985, 1986 or 1987; we are talking about something that happened less than a year ago. If I had someone working for me who let all of that brew up, and then just sat there and said nothing, he would not be with me for much longer. I would be interested to hear when Mr Peppinck actually raised something with you as opposed to when the penny dropped in your mind that there was a serious problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a further point on which your documentation is silent, Mr President. Following the penny dropping in your mind late on the Thursday, what conversations were then had with Senator Richardson? As the document makes no reference to Senator Richardson coming back to you during the first week you were back&mdash;from 4 May onwards&mdash;is it the case that Senator Richardson has come down and asked you, as President of the Senate, to write a reference or introduction for someone? Knowing all that he must know about it, is it the case that he has sat there and had all these questions asked of him and said nothing to you about asking you to write such a reference or introduction, has pretended it has not happened? Is it the case that that is what happened over an entire week with someone you know well? I find that difficult to accept. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last but very much not least, Mr President, although I do not say that it was inappropriate of you to write this letter, I do wonder whether it was. You refer in the letter to assistance being sought of the Australian Government. It is not my view that the President of the Senate is a part of the Government. Parliament is there to keep a check on the Executive of the Government. As I understand it, the President of the Senate, as is the Speaker of the House, is meant to be an impartial parliamentary office holder, yet here we have a letter from the President of the Senate saying, `This is what the Australian Government wants', as though you were a part of that Government when the very success of this chamber relies on you being impartial towards the Government and Opposition. In that sense, I do not say you should not have written the letter, Mr President, but I do say that if I were in your shoes I would not have, for the very reason that I outlined. The presidency of the Senate is meant to be an impartial position. Parliament is meant to keep a check on the Executive and if I were President of the Senate I would not be caught dead with my name on a letter tallying around what the Australian Government does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, you may well remember long debates about this in the House of Representatives when Mr Snedden said that as an expression of his desire to remain impartial he would not even attend party meetings. I think, therefore, that he too would have been reluctant to write such a letter that ties in with the alleged wishes of the Australian Government. That does not mean, Mr President, that in holding the position you do you are not entitled&mdash;in fact, you would probably be wrong if you did not&mdash;to write letters seeking such assistance on behalf of Australian citizens. It is not that aspect of which I complain. It is the aspect of mentioning what the Australian Government wants on presidential letterhead. I think that is very regrettable. </PARA>

I do not think either of those allegations are to be taken lightly and I do not think either of those allegations are in any way justified by the facts that have been put forward.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is being alleged about Senator Sibraa? A lot of questions are being asked. We had there in this most recent exercise yet another fishing expedition in questions about what might be here. They were questions without any substance at all. They were just throwing a hook down a hole in the hope that something might bite. After two hours of questions&mdash;we doubled the normal time allotted for Question Time&mdash;no fish were biting. We have had debates before in the Senate, and this debate has now been going for over an hour. There are still no fish being hooked; nothing has been landed. There is nothing to underpin this except an anxiety to keep a good issue going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I go to the comments I want to make about the core elements of the motion proposed by Senator Hill and the circumstances as they surround the actions of the President in this matter, I want to respond to one issue&mdash;not to respond to all the fishing expeditions&mdash;that was raised by Senator Vanstone. She was concerned that the President had written a letter saying that somebody had sought the assistance of the Australian Government and that that in some way therefore implied that Senator Sibraa was lining himself up as a member of the executive arm of government rather than as a representative of the Parliament. That seems to me to be a very strange interpretation of the words. In the first event, Senator Sibraa was making the comments as a senator of the Australian Parliament in writing to an officer of the Australian Government saying, `This person has sought the Government's assistance. I am writing to the Government on this person's behalf'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was an implication in an earlier part of the debate that it is somehow unusual that the President should be the person who is approached in this matter. It does not seem to me to be of the order of magnitude that would have warranted an approach to people like the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans), to whom reference was made. It should be a matter of pride to the President that he is well known around the Parliament as a person with significant expertise in the area of foreign affairs and as a person who has a wide range of contacts in governments around the world where he has had meetings not as an effective representative of the Australian Government but certainly as a very effective representative of Australia. He has done us proud in forums around the world in his various capacities as chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, as he was for a long period where he served very well, as President and in many other capacities. So I put those things on the record in response to the allegations in Senator Vanstone's address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The alleged crime which justifies the conclusion that Senator Sibraa has compromised the office of President of the Senate is that he wrote a letter based on documents which looked at the time, and look at the moment, to be authoritative&mdash;documents which bear all the normal hallmarks which would be looked for as documents authentically produced on behalf of the Government of the Marshall Islands. There is nothing on the face of them which would indicate that they are other than that. There is nothing at this stage to establish that they are other than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certain matters are being pursued in the Marshall Islands court that might indicate some questions now about the status of those documents, although that is certainly far from established. It may be that when that court case is concluded we can draw some conclusions about that document, but there is nothing in it to indicate that any senator presented with those documents would have concluded that it was reasonable to ask whether they were or were not bona fide documents from the Government of the Marshall Islands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nature of the request that was made of Senator Sibraa&mdash;he was not being requested to sign a treaty on behalf of Australia; he was not being requested to enter into negotiations on behalf of the Government of the Marshall Islands&mdash;was to write a letter to a middle-ranking officer of the Australian Government, whom he knew well, saying, `It would be useful if you could arrange some contacts for this person'. At the time of the meeting in November last year, without the benefit of hindsight and on the basis of any information any of us would have had at that time, those documents would have seemed to be of sufficient authority and stature to warrant the fairly modest level of action that Senator Sibraa was asked to take and which he did take. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we consider this letter in the context of letters which have been written surrounding this matter by other senators about which we have had a debate in this House in the past&mdash;and I do not agree with the conclusion the Senate came to, but that is its right&mdash;it does not constitute a reference for Mr Symons. It is a letter of introduction, which is remarkably different from a reference. It does not say, `This is a person worthy of your endorsement'. It does not say, `I suggest you enter into business with this person because he is a pretty good bloke and of good repute'. It accurately describes what the documents before Senator Sibraa said, with one qualification, which he himself has made with hindsight. I think it is fair to say that we all concur with the President that he might well have better drafted the letter. But I would not say that the fact that six months ago the President might have somewhat better drafted a letter constitutes compromising the office of the President of the Senate by any reasonable assessment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the second element of the allegations surrounding this matter? It is that as a result of these representations Senator Sibraa arranged a meeting through the normal channels with the appropriate officer in a manner in which the appropriate officer considered perfectly proper and perfectly normal. That is the second grave allegation. It is very hard to see how this compromises the office of the President of the Senate. If we are looking at what the crime is, what the President is being found guilty of, it is of course guilt by association. His really heinous crime is that he knows Senator Richardson. That is the matter of which he is guilty. Also, he met Symons, and apparently he met him in 1979 or some time around then; I think he said today in the Senate that it was 12 years ago. Having met him twice is a very serious offence, of course. </PARA>

If that is the Opposition's allegation, why does it not have the guts to say that his serious offence is guilt by association?  Those opposite try to pretend they have some serious basis in this flimsy bit of nonsense that their leader and others have put forward when in fact what they are saying&mdash;which is now clear&mdash;is that he is guilty by association.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is an outrageous breach of the proper attitude which a leader of a political party should take towards the role of the Presiding Officer in the Parliament. Once again, that would not be a source of any wonder. On the evidence, there is nothing to substantiate the allegation that Senator Sibraa has compromised the office of the President of the Senate.

It was only on the Thursday when the linkage was made that Senator Sibraa's memory was jolted. People tend not to challenge that. They ask why a member of his staff did not remember this.

I do not challenge that Liberal Minister's integrity. He is still on the front bench. In fact, I have no question, because he thought at the time, as did a lot of other people, that Mr Nugan was a reasonable and fair businessman. We know differently now.

As soon as the report became available, my understanding is that Senator Sibraa sent it to Senator Coulter and Senator Hill, I think, and other Independent senators&mdash;straight away, without hesitation. Naturally, that put it in the public domain. He also, I think, released it to the press for them to comment on. So, having made his full investigation, he took the first available opportunity to make that involvement known. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the question of how much Senator Sibraa should have checked. I guess that the next time he writes a letter he will check a little more deeply. There is no question about that. He will also make sure that the phraseology of the letter is better. He has already expressed regret on that point. I suppose that no-one over there, though, has ever written a letter or put out a press release that was not word perfect. I am getting a lot of press releases from the other side now of how I have reduced the Australian Army from four battalions to six, press releases in which there are millions of grammatical errors and in which the figures never add up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People do make mistakes. Mr Downer makes mistakes. Senator Sibraa's letter, especially in that crucial phrase that we have been over time and time again here, should have been better phrased. He admits that. That is not a hanging offence. It is nothing other than a trivial mistake. But it does reflect somewhat on the pressure that people are under when they sign letters and when they have a heavy workload. We concede that we all should take more care. Senator Vanstone makes the point that Senator Sibraa should have known Mr Symons better, et cetera. I have already answered that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then get all the rhetorical questions. Had Senator Richardson asked anyone else? That was inserted into this debate with not the slightest bit of evidence. Should Senator Sibraa, in his busy schedule, not have taken time off, grabbed Senator Richardson and said, `Now, who else have you asked to write a reference or a letter of introduction for Mr Symons?'. What absolute rubbish!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Vanstone made a point I find intriguing. She said, `Senator Sibraa should be independent. He should be like the great Speaker Snedden&mdash;above politics. What a wonderful person he was to be above politics'. If honourable senators walk around this building, they can see Speaker Snedden writ large where he sought revenge on all those who frustrated him in his career. The Opposition executive meeting room was specifically designed as a very small room so that we would be embarrassed when we occupied it. Bad luck, Mr Snedden, we are still here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A whole series of design faults&mdash;and some honourable senators opposite know this as well as I do&mdash;were put there deliberately by Speaker Snedden to dud Prime Minister Fraser. So when people come up to me and tell me that he was the ideal independent Speaker I think, `What a load of absolute rubbish!'. Mr President, you do not have to ape Speaker Snedden. You have done the job fairly in this chamber over the years you have held the office. You have not hesitated to sit Ministers down, much to their displeasure at times. You have not hesitated to discipline either side. I think you have behaved in the great tradition of Senate Presidents&mdash;with fairness and objectivity. I know that this motion today will not alter that, and the Opposition does not intend it to do so. We will continue to have fair guidance from the Chair in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought it was interesting that honourable senators opposite had no difficulty in approaching Mr President today to tell him the running order of their speakers. They did not really despise him. They were quite happy to wander up there and say, `Here is the next question to go to so and so'. They did not say, `By the way, he is going to attack you'. The relationship was totally normal. This is just a political ploy. It is a weak one. Let us face it, we have had a big match build-up to this. We were told what a massive Question Time we were to have today. `We need two hours for Question Time', we were told in the press. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What a pathetic performance it was. It cleared the gallery in no time. They were all wandering around the building saying, `What happened? Why didn't they ask any questions that mattered? Why didn't they turn up anything new?' Honourable senators opposite promised us this big two-hour Question Time. They probably expected us to resist it. We knew they had nothing to raise that was relevant. We were happy to have two hours. I guess the only reason we did not have three is that Senator Button and I wanted to go and have a smoke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, the case so far adduced by the Opposition, to support not a censure motion but, nevertheless, a serious motion against the President, is weak in the extreme. It is mostly based on asking rhetorical questions, as though there are conspiracies hiding under every bed. Mr President, I have total confidence in the way you have handled this matter. I appreciate the fact that you have expressed regret as to the way your letter was phrased. I believe that you have upheld the highest principles of propriety that this chamber would expect of you. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In dealing with your statement, Mr President, I think it is important that we also deal with the statutory declaration tabled by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Evans) as part of his answer to the question that I asked him today drawing  his memory to my original question of 7 May that he investigate dealings between Mr Symons and the United States Embassy and/or consulates. Mr President, you will recall, as everybody else will recall, that Senator Evans said on that occasion that he simply did not know anything about it and that he was not going to inquire into it, either.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite curious, I think, in looking at all the material that has come before us, to go right back to taws and to ask why Senator Richardson chose to bring Mr Symons to see you, Mr President. Why did he choose you, Senator Sibraa&mdash;the President of the Senate&mdash;when he could have gone to Senator Evans, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, who would have met the criterion, the so-called reason that he went to you, far better? It was because you had better contacts in the United States than did Senator Richardson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Richardson made this statement in an interesting interview that he gave with John Laws and that predated the handing over of his now infamous statement to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). In that interview with John Laws, Senator Richardson said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I introduced Greg Symons to him in a sense&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>referring to you, Mr President. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He already knew him because Greg had been a member of the Labor Party, although he has not been for 10 years, and I introduced him to him and asked him to help him.</PARA>
<PARA>Laws said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To help him in what sort of way?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Richardson replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I have said in the Senate the other day, Mr Symons had asked me for the names of officials he might be able to contact in the United States about his scheme. I did not know anyone but Kerry Sibraa who has had a much longer closer association with the United States than I may have known someone, so I asked Senator Sibraa if he could spare a few minutes to find out.</PARA>
<PARA>Surely, if Senator Richardson wanted to introduce Mr Symons to someone who had good contacts in the United States, he would have taken him to Senator Evans. But he did not choose to do that. He chose to take him to you, and this is where the worry is. The worry is that it is the old mates game in action. The fact is that Senator Richardson, the much proclaimed numbers man of the Right of the Labor Party, controlled the numbers that would control your preselection. Senator Richardson brought Mr Symons to see you on 12 November, and your preselection took place on 11 December. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We still have not got to the bottom of who wrote the letter. We have in your statement simply a statement that the letter was drafted and handed to you and that you signed it. You have said that Senator Richardson did not dictate the letter to you.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SE4">Senator BISHOP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was an absolute disgraceful scam. The `prospectus document', and I can only describe it as a prospectus document, dated 11 August, which Senator Baume showed the Senate in Question Time today, showed that the scheme was this: Mr Symons and a variety of consultants, together with Multiplex, were promoting a high-tech complex and education centre&mdash;a high-tech park, I think it is called&mdash;to be built in the Marshall Islands at a cost of $40m and to be built by Multiplex. In that prospectus there was a photograph of Mr Ross MacGibbon, who was going to be in charge of this project. Mr Ross McGibbon, of course, has had dealings with Senator Richardson before, as we have now seen on the public record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The complex was to be built for this $40m but was to be paid for by what I can only describe as a disgraceful scheme. That scheme was to sell passports to the Marshall Islands to Asian `investors'. They were being told that, with this passport and by taking citizenship, they would get access to the United States. The prospectus says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In return for citizenship of the Republic, participants in the program will invest in the trust which will finance, develop, market and operate the Marshall Islands technology park.</PARA>
<PARA>There was a big hiccup in this plan: under the agreement between the United States and the Marshall Islands, it was only natural-born citizens of the Marshall Islands who got that privilege, not foreigners who had bought their way in. In order for those people who bought their citizenship to get access to the United States there would have to be a change to the United States law. How do I know that?  Because I read the remarkable statutory declaration sworn by Mr Miles Kupa, public servant, working in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, who said, on a note concerning Gregory Symons:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Symons called me on 25 November he explained that the business proposition he was promoting in the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) depended for its success on obtaining a change to the independence charter of the RMI, which could be done through US legislation. He said RMI independence arrangements allowed natural-born RMI citizens to have rights of free entry, including work, in the USA. His proposition involved the development of a Technology Park in the RMI through investment inducements&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>a lovely word, `inducements'. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">which would confer RMI citizenship on persons who invested a minimum of $250,000 in the park. Obtaining that investment, he said, would be relatively easy if the USA were to extend the same rights of entry and work to those citizens as to those natural-born.</PARA>
<PARA>Part of the letters given to you, Mr President, which have suddenly turned up from the United States in the Foreign Affairs file, was indeed the letter from the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Marshall Islands. In the most significant part of this letter from the Minister of Foreign Affairs, on which you tell us you relied in part to write your reference&mdash;and it is not true to say that it is not a reference; it is a reference, because you are giving him the imprimatur of the Australian Government&mdash;it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This letter confirms that Mr. Greg Symons and Mr. Paul Finch are appointed as consultants to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Ambassador of the Republic of the Marshall Islands to the United States of America for the purpose of advising and negotiating with representatives of the United States on the clarification of and amendments to the Compact of Free Association.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the important bit. The letter goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This appointment is solely for the purpose of the establishment of a Business Migration Program in the Marshall Islands, whereby investors granted citizenship in the Marshall Islands would receive no less favourable treatment than native-born citizens of the Republic for the purposes of entering into the United States of America.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, this man, Mr Symons, was using every contact he had in the book to get himself access to people in the United States to change the legislation to meet his scam. This is the man to whom the President of the Senate gave a reference. Furthermore, if we want to go back under the `old mates Act' to see the sorts of things Mr Symons used to get into, a nice little paragraph appears on the business pages of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on Thursday, 21 May 1992 headed `Symons' life before Richo' which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Greg Symons, the man at the centre of the Richo affair, certainly has had some interesting business links during the past few years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">CBD</EMPHASIS> hears Symons was involved in a land deal at Port Stephens north of Newcastle, which became something of a local <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">cause celebre</EMPHASIS>, after blocks on the shores of picturesque Myall Lakes were sold before zoning approval was granted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Greg's fellow participants in the deal included Eastern Suburbs property behemoth John Lyons, who once had close links with Sir Ron Brierly, and another well known gadfly about town Russell `She Wears My Ring' Goward. Goward's involvement in the affair caused great consternation among his colleagues, particularly Sir Ron, and eventually contributed to his exit from IEL.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whether that icon of the Gold Coast white shoe brigade, Brian Ray, was involved in that particular deal is a little difficult to determine although the Bananaland property developer certainly has been linked to Symons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Port Stephens land deal involved the purchase of huge tracts of land, subdivision and sale to what turned out to be mug punters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unfortunately, the local regulators never allowed any dwellings on the blocks as State and local authorities are unwilling to extend the much promised roads and basic services to the land.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Symons has not changed his ways much; whether it is flogging off land to unfortunate punters in the Newcastle area or selling off passports and citizenship in the Marshall Islands to punters who think they are going to get access to the United States. The only trouble is that they have to change the law in the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Somewhere in my readings during the last several days I managed to see an interesting curriculum vitae of Mr Symons and his links with the well known front runners of the Sussex Street brigade. Of course, it goes back to the time when you, Mr President, were an office bearer in Sussex Street and responsible for dealing with Young Labor and when there were known instances of Mr Symons being found a job on a ministerial staff during the Whitlam years. On and on it goes. In other words, Mr Symons is not an unknown quantity. When Senator Richardson said to you that Mr Symons was known to you, Mr President, he meant it&mdash;Mr Symons was known to you. Senator Richardson did not really have to introduce you. Sure, you may not have seen much of Mr Symons and might not have wanted to write that letter, either. I can understand that, but Senator Richardson controls the numbers in New South Wales, and you knew it. If he asked you to write a letter, you would write the letter. That is why he went to you and why he did not go to Senator Evans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans is not off the hook either. Senator Evans gave us a lot of gobbledegook about why he could not possibly tell the Senate about all these documents until today. He told us it was too late on Thursday, 7 May for him to let us see the information that he had to hand. There is a problem with that. I had a look at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> which shows that at 3.54 p.m. on 7 May I stood to take note of Senator Evans' answer earlier in the day. Senator Evans rose to respond to what I had to say at 3.57 p.m. On top of the letter that is attached to the statutory declaration of Mr Kupa&mdash;the one referred to by my colleague Senator Newman&mdash;that is, the copy of the undated letter faxed to the United States by Senator Sibraa on 20 November, is the information that it came from DFAT on 7 May at 3.53 p.m. In other words, Senator Evans had ample time to come back into the Senate at any time between then and two minutes past 11 when the Senate rose and bring to the attention of the Senate the fact that these documents had been brought to his attention by his own Department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to know at whose instigation or on whose volition this statutory declaration was sworn? I suspect it may have been sworn by Mr Kupa on his own volition due to concern for his own reputation. He wanted it on the record that he was doing the right thing. He thought that if he did not swear a statutory declaration and get it out the truth of this matter may never come to fruition. When one reads his statement, the statement of Mr Lamb and the statement to Graham Richardson, one sees that the story lines do not exactly stack up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, all along this disgraceful scam was designed to dupe the United States Government by using Mr Symons as an instrument to try to change legislation to allow him to flog off citizenship in the Marshall Islands to get entry into the United States. What a disgraceful situation. That sort of scam has already been well and truly noted in Mr Symons' past dealings with regard to land deals in the Newcastle area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another interesting aspect in the documentation produced by Senator Evans is the memo sent to Senator Richardson&mdash;which he says he never saw&mdash;which outlines the scam. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the treaty between the Marshall Islands and the USA known as the `Compact of Free Association', citizens of the Marshall Islands are entitled to enter the USA with a valid passport but without the need for any visa or other documentation. They can own property, work and reside in the USA. Similar entitlements apply to USA citizens entering the Marshall Islands.</PARA>
<PARA>As I said before, when one reads Mr Lamb's statement he says that Mr Symons told him that that is in fact not true. It all depended&mdash;and I repeat&mdash;upon the United States extending the same rights of entry and work to those citizens who were natural born. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another discrepancy that comes out of this statutory declaration. Mr Kupa says that on the afternoon when I asked the question&mdash;and in response to that question Senator Evans said he was not aware of any dealings between Mr Symons and the Australian embassies&mdash;he telephoned Mr O'Leary to establish whether the Department knew of any such dealings. He was not instructed to do that. That is interesting, is it not? The Minister said that he would not investigate, but an officer who was paying attention immediately began the investigation. Was it the fact that he did not want to be caught out the way in which others had been caught out over the Brian Burke affair?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr O'Leary then replied to Mr Kupa. The statutory declaration reads this way:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that there may have been such dealings, in Washington.</PARA>
<PARA>The next sentence reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Sibraa had written to the Embassy to ask if it could facilitate meetings for Mr Symons in Washington. A copy of this letter had been sent by the Embassy to the Department at the time. In the context of a telephone conversation with me &mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and this is Mr O'Leary speaking&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in early April (Note:  6 April), about Mr Symons's court appearance in the Marshall Islands, he had mentioned the possibility of a meeting between Mr Symons and the Washington Embassy and had referred to the Sibraa letter. He had then faxed some documents about the Symons case, including a copy of Senator Sibraa's letter to this Office.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a statement that said that that letter was faxed to the Sydney office on 6 April. Mr Kupa said in response that he had no memory of that conversation with Mr O'Leary or the early part of it other than that it related to Symons's own court case. The statutory declaration continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . but that, while he had been talking about Washington to me, a recollection of some reference on his part to a Symons-Washington connection in the earlier conversation had come to me. However, I did not recall him having referred at that time to a letter from Senator Sibraa. Nor did I recall seeing a copy of such a document, which I thought I would have. I asked Mr O'Leary to undertake a check of his Branch's files and to send copies of the documents relating to the possibility of contact between Mr Symons and the Washington Embassy to me as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.  Mr O'Leary undertook to do so and later that afternoon the documents (copies attached, marked A to F), including a copy of Senator Sibraa's letter, were sent to the office and I received them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.  I have no recollection of seeing the documents, including the Sibraa letter, prior to their receipt in the Office on the afternoon of 7 May.</PARA>
<PARA>He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I conveyed the documents to Senator Evans later that afternoon&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is still 7 May&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">after his second exchange with Senator Bishop in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA>He gave the documents to Senator Evans. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I had not informed Senator Evans earlier of my 6 April conversation with O'Leary&mdash;Senator Evans was overseas . . .</PARA>
<PARA>He does not believe there was any other information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the day that I asked the question, Senator Evans had that information and simply did not come back into the Senate and admit that it was available. Of course, it included the new letter, the one dated 4 December, that Senator Sibraa had unfortunately filed. It is the first time that we really get a date for Senator Sibraa's original letter, because the one that was faxed was undated. This letter says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter of 20 November concerning the visit to Washington of Greg Symons and Paul Finch, whose visit enabled them to discuss with US officials opportunities for stimulating business development in the Republic of the Marshall Islands.</PARA>
<PARA>This letter is written by Mr Christopher Lamb, the same Mr Christopher Lamb who wrote in his statement that Mr Symons had said that this whole scam depended on the United States changing its legislation. The letter goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We were able to have a useful briefing session in the Embassy and over a fast-food lunch with Greg and Paul &mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Old friends by now, are they, Greg and Paul?  It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . which aimed at offering them a useful opportunity to size up the possibilities. In subsequent conversations they said they seemed to have met the right people and to have come away with some fresh ideas as to how best to organise their business.</PARA>
<PARA>That is, subvert the course of legislation in another country. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On another note, we are looking forward to seeing you in Washington on 11 January. The plan, as discussed with Fred Peppinck, is to have a good working dinner with senior leadership personnel from both Houses of the Congress. We should also have an opportunity to discuss other (more Australian) matters during the morning of 12 January.</PARA>
<PARA>This is all very chummy, folksy stuff. It is all, `Dear Chris'; it is all, `Greg and Paul had a nice lunch'. Mr President, this is not a formal letter written about somebody about whom you knew nothing; this is all the old mates act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, it saddens me, because I really do believe that you would not have chosen to write that letter of your own volition. I really do believe that pressure was brought upon you to write it for the reasons I have set out. The problem is that you put the imprimatur of the Australian Government on a man who is a worthless individual, who has bought disrepute upon this country and who has finally brought at least one Minister undone, if not more to follow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, it is not good enough to say that, given your druthers, you would have phrased the letter a little differently. I bet you would. Given your druthers, you wish you would have said no to Senator Richardson when you were asked to help a mate. I can understand that when you wrote it there was no way in the world you thought it would end up in this mess. You probably thought it would go unknown. But at the end of the day, Mr President, we still have to know who drafted the letter and the pressure that was brought to bear&mdash;and I guess you are going to have to say that no pressure was brought to bear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You are going to have to say why, when you really did know more about this individual&mdash;or, if you did not, it was so easily accessible for you to know more about him&mdash;you chose to recommend him as a respectable businessman. In fact, he was a man promoting a scam; a man who had a history of promoting scams. We have to know why it was that you chose to put the imprimatur of the Australian Government under the letterhead of the President of the Senate and, truly, not only bring the Senate into disgrace but also the Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might disagree with the policies of the Government of the day, I might disagree with things that it does, but as far as people who go offshore and represent us outside this country are concerned, I want to be proud of my country. I want to say, `This is a fine country, the people have chosen this Government at the present time and I expect it to behave in a certain way'. It gives me no joy at all to see that people in a foreign land will see that those in the Government have acted in an improper way. There are still questions that need to be answered. That is the reason why Senator Hill has moved the motion in the way that he has and why I believe it should be carried. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point at hand is a very important point. Senator Bishop has not within her any generosity in judging other people's characters. When she attacked you, Mr President, in the restrained way that she had to, it was an indication that there is really no evidence at all against you. You have acted as President in this chamber. I have noted and listened to all the speeches made here today and there has not been one attack upon you in your capacity as the President and to act impartially and properly as a President. There has not been one skerrick of evidence that indicates that you are not amongst the most excellent of Presidents ever to have graced this chamber&mdash;and there have been some great Presidents of this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been said that because you, Mr President, have written a letter you should be treated in a fashion which would humiliate any person in your position. I will come back to that. Let us assume that the Opposition is correct about the letter. The Opposition has not had the ability when looking at this matter to weigh in the balance the great work that you have done for this Senate and the way you have represented this country overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The words of this motion say that you, Mr President, did not take due care. What is due care? Had you written this letter to the Ambassador of the United States or to some head of Government, you may have expressed it differently. But, as I understand what you said, you wrote to a congressional liaison officer, someone you know, and asked him to give help, if possible, to this person. You did not ask him to introduce this person to a specific person; you asked whether he could help him. This is a person whom you know and who knows the system. This is a person within the Embassy who takes the appropriate action, who feeds it back through the system and who takes these people for a quick meal. But there is nothing in that reply which indicates that he in any way did any more than suggest that these people, if they want to, might make these contacts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To say that this is trying to corrupt the legislative process of the Congress is an absurd statement when those people looking at this would be well equipped with advice. The people who are elected to Congress, the people in the Senate and government officials in the United States are hardly the sort of people who will be duped by a scheme such as this. The statements you relied on were statements which, when you read them and took them at face value, as you were entitled to, had considerable strength. People have admitted in their arguments&mdash;they have found it difficult to get around and have not got around&mdash;that if somebody arrived on their doorstep with a letter from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from any state and a letter from the Cabinet of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, they would have been persuaded that that person had, as he did have, authority from the Government of the Marshall Islands. </PARA>

As I spoke about them, her inference was that they were part of a sleazy scam. If they were, that is nothing against Senator Sibraa because he was entitled to look at these letters from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and from the office of Cabinet and to act upon them. We should look at the way he acted upon them. If we look at the letter that he wrote, there is no reference to Greg Symons's character. He described him factually and within the sphere of his knowledge as a commercial lawyer and businessman and an adviser to the President of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. Senator Bishop should show me where in that letter there is any more than a request to the congressional liaison officer, Christopher Lamb, to see what he can possibly do. He does not override the judgment which no doubt he expected Mr Lamb to make as to what he ought or ought not do. There is nothing that has followed as a consequence of this letter that would in any way indicate that the United States Government was ever affected by it, let alone ever knew about it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That question, no doubt asked facetiously, bears out exactly the problem that the Opposition faces. This letter has been treated in the very way that the President when he wrote it intended it to be treated&mdash;as a request by a friend, Christopher Lamb, to help these people if he could. That is all that has happened. That is the trouble with the Opposition's case. Where is the evidence that this has produced any results in the United States? Where is the evidence that this letter has brought this Senate into disgrace? Where is the evidence that it has brought this country into disgrace? It is a hyperbole to allege that it has.

So she turns her guns on the President, a man who has done no more than act in a way consistent with a senior Cabinet Minister, whom he has known for years and respects, bringing a person to him, consistent with the letters that this person had from the Government of the Marshall Islands, and consistent with his own sense of decency and fair play. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a couple of other points. The President's affiliation with the Australian Labor Party has been raised. No doubt, the day will come when the office of President will be held by an honourable senator from the other side. Comment has been made on the political pressures on such a person. I think it is true that there are such pressures. I have had occasion to look at a work entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">An Encyclopedia of Parliament </EMPHASIS>by Norman Wilding and Philip Laundy. Referring to the office of Speaker in England, it states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The quality most essential to a Speaker is strict impartiality . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I think the President has clearly demonstrated that, as has the Deputy President. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of his most important duties is to protect the rights of minorities and to ensure that their voices are heard.</PARA>
<PARA>The President has certainly done that. The encyclopaedia continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Once elected, he forgets party affiliations and is immune to external influences in any form.</PARA>
<PARA>In England, the custom is that once a Speaker is elected by the Parliament, that is the end of the matter; he or she is immune from challenge. That is the rule. However, as this encyclopedia states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, for instance, the Speakership is regarded as a privilege of the party in power, and the occupant of the Chair usually changes with the Government. The Speaker is generally opposed in his constituency during a General Election, and fights for his seat along partisan lines like any other candidate.</PARA>
<PARA>If the Opposition is concerned that political influence is brought to bear on the President&mdash;be it the current President or any other President&mdash;it should make him immune from future elections by giving him a seat or a position on a combined Senate paper where he is immune. It is not to the point to say that, as a member of a party, the President, or anybody else, has associations within that party. It is quite clear that that is so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to tell a story. I was friendly with a young doctor some years ago&mdash;he has since become a very eminent doctor&mdash;who attended someone who was injured at Dandenong. That person was taken to hospital, where he later died from gunshot wounds. A murder trial followed. My friend was put into the box and heavily cross-examined by an eminent lawyer, Frank Galbally, and taken to task over why he did not take note of various things which were pertinent to the murder trial. As my friend said, he had many things on his mind at that time, not the least of which was to save a person's life. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an illustration of how it is very easy to look at things in hindsight and with a specific purpose in mind. Richard II, on returning from Ireland and finding his kingdom in revolution, said, `Call back yesterday'. I suppose we would all like to call back yesterday. Those of us examining what the President did on the occasion in question are in the very happy position of having before us all of the material and all of the knowledge that we need about Mr Symons and his activities. We can made a judgment. That is an unfair way, in my view, to judge this. A person should be judged in the context of what he did at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been pointed out, on that occasion a person equipped with a strong endorsement</PARA>
<PARA>from a government which he said he represented&mdash;and in fact did so represent&mdash;was introduced to the President by an eminent member of the Cabinet. The President wrote a letter to a person whom he knew within the foreign affairs Department, knowing that person would check up, as that person did, and that he would exercise his proper judgment. He did no more than indicate to Mr Symons where else he might make inquiries. That is what happened on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The result was as expected. Mr Symons made such efforts without obtaining the result that he sought. The service that the President performed on this occasion had the expected result; a letter of request was given to somebody to do something for someone who seemed to have the proper credentials. It was not a big thing; he was simply pointed in the direction of where he might make further inquiries. It was not a letter to any ambassador or to any official of the American Government or any other government; it was a letter to a person whom he knew through his work in the President's office. It was the sort of letter which many of us might write in the circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The President has come away from this debate unchallenged in terms of his job in this chamber. That is the interesting thing.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Parliament is sitting for the first time in two weeks. Since we began our sitting six hours ago, the greatest part of the time has been concentrated on the Symons affair. Senator Richardson, who was a Cabinet Minister, resigned from the Ministry because of the way in which he failed to give full and proper answers to this Senate and his failures as a Minister, all to do with his relationship with his cousin, a Sydney businessman and former ALP mate, Greg Symons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, the matter that has been more directly before us has been that which has flowed from your statement to this chamber the minute we resumed. You gave us a statement of some two pages, to which is attached the statement you gave to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on 15 May and some related correspondence. In response to the statement you made in the Senate about this current matter, the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Hill, has moved:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the President's statement and expresses its grave concern that the President of the Senate failed to exercise due care in requesting the Australian Embassy in Washington to assist Mr Symons and, as a result, made false assertions in his request, thus compromising the Office of the President of the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, I am very glad that you are now in the chair to respond to those who have spoken in the Senate this afternoon and this evening. As I understand it, I am the last speaker from this side of the Senate in the debate. I hope that you will speak to this motion and answer the relevant matters and questions that were raised, not least by my Liberal colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe, Mr President, that the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Hill) and my five Liberal colleagues who have spoken in this debate have sustained the motion. No-one has shown here today that there was not a failure on your part to exercise due care in your request to the Australian Embassy in Washington, and no-one has shown that you did not make false assertions in that request. Indeed, refreshingly, you acknowledged in your statement that you did make errors in the letter that was written. You acknowledged that you had taken this person who was introduced to you by your colleague, a Labor Minister, on face value. Your excuse was that this person, to the extent that he was some con man&mdash;not only before you but also, it seems, before the Government of the Marshall Islands and, indeed, even in his relationship with his cousin, the now resigned Cabinet Minister, Senator Richardson&mdash;misled you. Because certain matters were not checked, you were responsible for this failure and you made these false statements. From the contributions to the debate today it seems that your Government colleagues and the Australian Democrat senators do not agree with the Opposition's contention that this has sufficiently compromised the office of President of the Senate or that it is of sufficiently grave concern for them to vote in favour of the Opposition's motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to add a new element to the points made by Senate colleagues that directly relate to the letter that you wrote and addressed to our embassy in Washington. I refer to the statement that you made to the Senate today and your relationship with the Prime Minister. Before I do that I wish to acknowledge three things that have been referred to at different times by Senator Ray, Senator Cooney and, I think, Senator Evans.  The first is that for more than four years&mdash;and as an Opposition senator, I acknowledged this&mdash;you have served the Senate well as President of the Senate. Senator Cooney felt that a number of your critics did not put proper emphasis on the substantial way in which you have contributed to the tradition&mdash;a good tradition&mdash;of Presidents of the Senate and guided this chamber over the period in which you have been President. I acknowledge that you have done that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, there is the question of writing letters of introduction for citizens of Australia. It is undoubtedly accepted by all senators that it is appropriate for the President of the Senate or for any senator to write appropriate letters of introduction, even within the terms of reference of what you were attempting to do, to help Australian citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, I acknowledge that the important position of President of the Senate carries with it, along with a priority responsibility for this chamber and for the whole Parliament, a very considerable responsibility in respect of international relations. I readily acknowledge the skills and knowledge that you, Mr President, have brought to that important aspect of your position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion is before us today because Opposition senators do regard it as a matter of grave concern that the letter was written without sufficient due care. This kind of letter should not come from any of us, least of all from the President of the Senate. Frankly, my criticism is directed much more at a Minister of this Government who put undue pressure on his mate and party colleague, the President of the Senate&mdash;a person from the same right wing faction of the Labor Party in New South Wales. He brought with him his cousin, a businessman who also has connections with the same right wing of the Labor Party in New South Wales. He put undue pressure on the President of the Senate to write a letter of introduction that would be helpful to his cousin in what in fact was a con job on the Government of the United States and the Government of the Marshall Islands for his own pecuniary benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not heard anyone today, nor have I had anyone outside this place, say that the millions of dollars involved in this scheme were to the benefit of Senator Richardson personally or to the benefit of the Labor Party in New South Wales. No-one has made that allegation. Despite the mateship and the pressuring of persons to make it possible for Symons to have access to key members of the United States Government and key members of Congress, quite apart from Ministers in the Marshall Islands, I do not believe that there is any evidence to show that the millions of dollars that were supposed to be reaped from the scheme cooked up by the unfortunate Mr Symons, who is now facing trial in the court of the Marshall Islands, were to be received, confiscated or misappropriated by anyone other than Mr Symons and his partner. I have not heard any accusation that this was to the benefit personally of Senator Richardson or the Labor Party of New South Wales. But what is clear is that there is a mateship connection, a sense of obligation that I believe was used by Senator Richardson as a lever on you, Mr President. These sorts of pressures need to be so thoroughly resisted that no officer of this Senate and no officer of the Parliament will succumb to them in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the pressure on you as President was not only from the former Government Minister, Senator Richardson. Pressure was also applied on 13, 14 and 15 May by the Prime Minister, another right wing member of the Labor Party in New South Wales and an immediate colleague and immediate mate. I take grave exception to the way in which the Prime Minister put pressure upon you as President of the Senate and I wish to refer directly to that now. On the first page of your statement to the Senate today, you say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 13 May the Prime Minister asked me to provide to him a statement . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That was dynamite. This was in the context of Senator Richardson fighting for his life as a Minister of this Government. In fact, he lasted only five more days. The Prime Minister, under the barrage of parliamentary questions, press questions, public concern and headlines in the newspapers, and knowing that Senator Richardson's future as a Minister in this Government was, if not doomed, certainly in the balance, at the same time as it came to your own attention knew that there was a false letter of introduction written by the President of the Senate on behalf of this con man&mdash;another one involved in the mateship of the Labor Party in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is understandable that the Prime Minister would want some account from those whom he thought bore upon the Ministers of his Government, but I reject any assumed right of the Prime Minister or of the executive government to put any pressure at all on the President of the Senate. The President of the Senate stands way above the Prime Minister or the executive government. The President of the Senate is responsible to this chamber of the Parliament in all his conduct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened because of the Prime Minister's pressure swayed you to a line of action which I do not believe in retrospect you would now fully endorse. Let me ask you the questions now that I wished to ask had there been more than two hours for Question Time today. I ask these questions very sincerely. I would have put to you, Mr President, four questions. First, did you agree to report to the Prime Minister before you consulted representative senators of this chamber? You have clearly acknowledged that you brought your intention to respond to the Prime Minister to the knowledge of the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Hill), the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) and Independent senators. That is sufficient in terms of the number of senators to be consulted in the first instance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that Senator Vanstone and some others who have not spoken wish that you had contacted every senator, but that is not practical. Where I agree that all senators should have received communication from you was when you actually gave the report. These days, with stream fax, it is no problem administratively to bring your own report to this Senate to 76 senators ahead of the Prime Minister or any member of the executive government. It seems from your statement today, Mr President, that you had discussions with the Prime Minister on 13 May and agreed with him that you would meet his demand. After that, and only after that, you consulted representative senators as to your action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, did you seek the advice of the Clerk of the Senate before agreeing to report to the Prime Minister? Did you seek any advice from Senate staff with regard to the appropriate relationship between the President of the Senate and the Prime Minister? Certainly I will be dismayed if you did not consult the Clerk of the Senate or appropriate officers in the Senate so that you would be given careful advice to ensure that your position as President of the Senate was not compromised at the demand of the Prime Minister of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, what steps did you take to safeguard your independent standing as the President of this chamber of the Parliament, a position which is not accountable to the head of the executive government? Fourthly, why did you, yourself, not publish your statement but rather allow the Prime Minister, at his initiative, to publish the statement? Unfortunately, Mr President, the third page of the paper you put in front of us is a statement of the Prime Minister's, in which he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have today received the attached report from Senator Sibraa on matters relating to Mr Gregory Symons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will examine the report and await Senator Richardson's report on this matter which will be presented to me on Monday.</PARA>
<PARA>That was his statement here in Canberra on 15 May. The Prime Minister has published your letter to him and the two-page statement with the attached letters. I regard it as demeaning of the President of the Senate for the Prime Minister to publish his statement. I believe that, as President of the Senate, you should publish your own statement. I would have urged that your report on the Symons matter be addressed to all senators and that only a copy of that report to senators be sent to the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Your covering letter could have said, `Dear Prime Minister, in the light of your discussion with me, your questions of me, I send to you a copy of the statement that I have now circulated to all members of the Senate'.

You are the President of the Senate and your first responsibility is to the senators of this chamber. I, therefore, take grave exception to the way you were pressured on 13, 14, and 15 May by the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, and by the way he took initiatives that I believe embarrassed this chamber. I include those considerations in my support of the Opposition motion that is before us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by referring to the Australian public. When we debated the failures of Senator Richardson, on the last day of sitting of this Senate, I was one of the senators who spoke. I remember that Senator Aulich spoke after me and concluded what was a long debate about Senator Richardson. Following that debate, Senator Richardson has resigned. I said in that debate that the people of Australia do not want parliamentarians or governments that support favouritism, cronyism, or any kind of special privilege for their mates. They want members of parliament and governments that are objectively fair to all Australian citizens, that act in the national good and not for some private, sectional interest. One of the common features of the whole Symons affair is that members of the Labor Party have acted like mates. They have acted in a way which has helped their friends at the expense of others, not only in this country but also, as it turns out, in the Marshall Islands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that those values of the Australian people and the expectations of the Australian people demand that, when we have before us a statement such as that which you have made in the Senate today, Mr President, we ought to remind ourselves of the values of the Australian public and what the public expects of us. We should put such an emphasis upon the important office of the President of the Senate that will strengthen your hands and your successors' hands to withstand those undermining of values and the kinds of pressures which you have experienced from your mate, a Minister, Senator Richardson and from your mate, a Prime Minister, Mr Keating. </PARA>

As you would all be aware, these are very difficult circumstances under which to hold such a position, with the Government not having a majority.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have at all times been conscious of maintaining the impartiality of the office and availing myself to all senators irrespective of political affiliations. My role, by necessity, has often been that of a facilitator to many of you. It saddens me that in this instance, this is the basis of criticism or part of the criticism that is levelled against me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout the entire period that I have been aware of my involvement in the Gregory Symons matter I have never tried to conceal any information relating to this involvement. As stated in my report, I received a copy of the letter to Mr Lamb on the morning of Saturday, 9 May. On Monday, 11 May and Tuesday, 12 May I considered the matter carefully with my staff with a view to formulating a response to the Senate. Bearing in mind my responsibility to the Senate, I contacted all party leaders and Independent senators at the first opportunity to advise them that I would be reporting to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) although the Prime Minister was mindful that I did not have to do so. This was on the evening of Wednesday, 13 May. Soon after handing my report to the Prime Minister, copies of the report were delivered to party leaders and Independents by facsimile on the afternoon of 15 May. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not intend to respond to all the claims made by Opposition speakers today as many of them have been covered by my colleagues. However, there are some key issues I feel I must address. Firstly, in response to Senator Newman, I wish to advise that at lunch time today I had my attention drawn to an anomaly in the adjunct to my report which was tabled by the Prime Minister on 15 May. The reference to 7 May is a typographical error. Quite clearly it should have read, `I have been aware since 8 May'. With that clarified, I want to confirm, once again, that neither I nor my office was in any contact on this matter with Senator Evans's office until approximately 6 p.m. on Friday, 8 May. Senator Evans's senior adviser contacted my senior adviser at that time and told him that he was aware of the Lamb letter. That was at 6 p.m. on Friday, 8 May. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, Senator Newman asked why my senior adviser did not brief me on the Symons affair on my return to Australia. Very simply, my senior adviser was away overseas with me and, moreover, was absent from the office on Monday, 4 May on what I think was sick leave. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, I wish to respond to several speakers who raised the question of how I was aware of Symons's contact with Lamb. It is quite simple to explain. Symons was given Lamb's contact number on the 12th. My senior adviser spoke to Lamb the next day and said Symons would call. My senior adviser that same day spoke to Symons, who said he had already made contact with Lamb. The letter was sent one week later&mdash;on 20 November. All of this has been covered comprehensively in my reports which I tabled today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for my involvement in the matter, it goes as follows: although I would have met Mr Symons a long time ago, I did not know him well and I certainly had no contact with him for at least 10 to 12 years. As pointed out by Senator Robert Ray, I was never in Young Labor with Mr Symons; he is 42 and I will be 55 this year. I never held any position of authority or responsibility in Young Labor. To Senator Bishop, I can say as a party official that at no time was I ever in charge of Young Labor in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had no reason to doubt Mr Symons's credentials, given the nature of the documentation shown to both me and my senior adviser at the time. I knew nothing about Mr Symons that could have led me to doubt this. I did not take any action other than through normal channels. I did not give Mr Symons any other contact in Washington, either in the US State Department or in the Congress. I merely referred him to a person in the Australian Embassy in Washington who regularly deals with similar requests from other Australian business people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the request of Symons I wrote a letter to Mr Lamb which was a follow up on the telephone conversation between my senior adviser and Mr Lamb. As stated in my report, the letter was drafted by my senior adviser based on the information provided by Mr Symons at the meeting and on the telephone the next day. It was never intended for any person other than Mr Lamb. According to Mr Lamb himself, it was a perfectly appropriate course of action that I took. The letter was not a reference. The letter did not give instructions, nor convey support for Mr Symons's proposals. I did not seek to deliberately misrepresent Australian Government policy or the President of the Marshall Islands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where I have readily admitted I am at fault, with the benefit of hindsight, is in the wording of part of the letter. But at no time&mdash;and I wish to stress this&mdash;between sending the letter to Mr Lamb and the present have I been contacted by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for discussion, clarification, information, correction or retraction on any of these issues. Having regard to my position as President, I did not engage in public debate, despite some of the outrageous comments and allegations made by Opposition members. I must make reference to the fact that Dr Hewson publicly stated that I had done a deal with the Democrats which would give them my seat. I do not know how I possibly could have done that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I totally refute the imputation that my introduction of Mr Symons to Mr Lamb was in some way connected to my preselection to the Senate ticket, which was said this afternoon. For the information of senators, I knew long before 11 December&mdash;the date put forward by Senator Bishop&mdash;that I would be No. 3 on the New South Wales ALP ticket. The ALP preselection system is based upon proportional representation and it was always clear to me what my position would be. The three senators up for preselection had already reached agreement between ourselves. I had been No. 1 on the ticket the last two times and this time Senator Richardson was a Cabinet Minister. As I said, we have proportional representational voting. This is the sum total of my involvement upon which this motion is based. I reiterate that I have not tried to conceal my involvement and I have readily provided a full and frank explanation of my actions to the Prime Minister, the Senate and the public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to Senator Teague, who was the last speaker, that I reject totally what he said. The Prime Minister asked me to give him a report. He also said that I was under no obligation to do so. I said I was happy to do so but I would also be reporting to the Senate at the first opportunity, and he put that in his statement. I contrast that with the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) in the House of Representatives, who said that the Prime Minister should stand me down immediately. Senator Teague knows that he has no power to do that. I did discuss this matter with the Clerks. I received careful advice from the Clerks on a number of occasions. I published my report to the party leaders and I gave it out to the press before the Prime Minister released his report. There was some one hour's difference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I thank those senators who have expressed confidence in the way I have represented my office. I believe some of my work&mdash;in particular, with the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, in leading all-party parliamentary delegations to eastern Europe and in promoting parliamentary democracy&mdash;has brought credit to the Senate and to the office of President of the Senate. In answering those who have said that I demeaned the office of the President, I say only this: those who did not do me the courtesy or give my position the due respect of waiting to read my report before passing judgment and finding me guilty should seriously consider their own standards. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I wish to wind up the debate on my motion simply by reasserting what I said at the outset. Mr President, I have listened carefully to the debate, I have listened to the response of Senator Coulter on behalf of the Australian Democrats and I have listened to your answers to particular areas of concern that have been raised by senators during the debate. What I have heard, however, Mr President, does not in any way affect the terms of the motion which I have moved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Listening to your answers, I did not hear it suggested that the detail of your letter that related to assertions that Australia had been asked by the President of the Marshall Islands for assistance was correct. I think that it has been stated on the public record that it was incorrect. The charge that I put in this motion is that you should have exercised greater care in checking that material before you wrote a reference, or a letter, apparently, requesting the assistance of our Embassy in Washington. In failing to exercise that due care, we argue&mdash;and we remain of this view&mdash;that you have put at risk the high standing of your office or, in other words, that you have compromised that office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am surprised that the Australian Democrats will not accept that argument although, strangely, I did not hear it specifically addressed by Senator Coulter. Senator Coulter seemed to reiterate the Democrats' reaction a week or so ago, which was simply that they were satisfied that there was nothing irregular in you, Mr President, writing a reference or a letter of introduction for Symons to the Australian Embassy in Washington. But, as I said, I do not question that either. What we question, however, is that you did not show sufficient care to check with the Department the extraordinary facts that were put to you by Mr Symons. You did not check with the Department or with the Minister. As a result of that, the letter that you sent off to the Embassy in Washington included assertions of fact that were untrue. In doing that, in failing to exercise that due care, you ran the risk of putting, to some extent, Australia's foreign relations at risk, and we have a right to expect that the President of the Senate will not through lack of care put Australia's international relations in any form of compromised position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is our charge, Mr President. That is our criticism of you as President of the Senate. It seems to me that Senator Coulter did not address that specific charge at all. In this motion I say that it is certainly the view of this side of the chamber that it is a matter of grave concern when the President of the Senate fails to exercise due care when he takes actions which result in the making of false assertions that could embarrass Australia, thus compromising the position of the Office of the President. So we stand by the motion that I moved some time ago. I moved it with some regret, but I felt that I had no alternative. Again, I commend it to the Senate and I suggest that the Democrats, even at this late hour, if they are to recognise the responsibility they claim in this place towards accountability, reconsider their position and support this motion. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XG4">Senator GILES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Regarding Public Service Determination No. 27 of 1992, the Committee has received a copy of a report from the Merit Protection and Review Agency stating that the relevant legislative position was inequitable, anomalous and unfair. The report suggests that the situation be remedied by changes to the legislation. The present clause, which is addressed by this notice, deals with the subject matter of the MPRA report, but seems to ignore some of its recommendations that even entrench the relevant anomaly. This is a matter of considerable concern. I add that the determination in question was not made by the Minister but by a public official.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Regulations, the Committee has asked for an assurance that there is no prejudicial retrospectivity and for advice on why the more strict criminal standard of proof was applied to proceedings in the Federal Police Disciplinary Tribunal rather than a civil standard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two determinations under the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act provide for the Secretary or a delegate to overturn assessments of expert authorities with no indication of review of this discretion.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statements read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">   PUBLIC SERVICE DETERMINATION    NO.27 OF 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Determination deals with recreation leave for members of the Australian Public Service. Clause 11 appears to correct an anomaly under which the existing legislation operated to the detriment of a certain class of officers to the extent of depriving them of credit for up to one week's recreation leave. However, it appears that this correction only applies to present officers of the APS. It does not apply to officers who retired before the date of the Determination. Therefore, clause 11 appears only to benefit some of the people affected by the anomaly. For the others, it appears that the anomaly remains.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This general matter was the subject of an investigation and report by the Merit Protection and Review Agency, a statutory body whose charter, among other things, is `to ensure that actions taken and decisions made in relation to a Commonwealth employee . . . are fair and equitable.' The report, which examined the position of an officer who is not covered by clause 11, concluded that the existing position was `clearly . . . inequitable', `obviously anomalous', `unfair and inequitable' and required amendment or other action to mitigate its past and future consequences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is concerned that a subdelegate in the Department then made a Determination which not only failed to implement the strongly expressed findings of the MPRA report but also which may entrench the anomaly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Explanatory Statement is of little assistance, merely stating that the clause was a transitional provision which `clarifies' the matter. Clause 11 was also amended by later Determination, although apparently without affecting its substance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The broader issues raised by the Determination are also of concern. Numbers of Public Service Determinations confer discretions upon public officials. In the past the Committee has raised the question of merit review of these decisions. The answer the Committee has received was that merit review was available by the MPRA under established grievance procedures. The Committee accepted these assurances and refrained from raising other discretions. It would be disturbing if the Department felt itself able to ignore reports of the MPRA and legislate to preserve unfair and inequitable anomalies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">COMPLAINTS (AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE) REGULATIONS (AMENDMENT) STATUTORY RULES 1992 NO.58</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This short set of Regulations provides that the standard of proof required in proceedings before the Federal Police Disciplinary Tribunal is proof beyond reasonable doubt, which is the criminal standard of proof. The Regulations also provide that this standard extends to proceedings which commenced, or to a matter which arose, before the Regulations commenced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Explanatory Statement advised that the purpose of the amendment was to repeal and remake a regulation which recent advice indicated was invalidly made. There was no advice on the reason for this. The Committee assumed it was because the repealed regulation was made in 1985 and lacked the authority which was expressly inserted in the parent Act in 1987. The Committee has asked for confirmation of this.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Next, and more importantly, the Committee has asked for detailed advice on why the criminal standard of proof was prescribed for proceedings before the Tribunal, rather than the civil standard of the balance of probabilities. The Committee accepts that this is a sensitive area, but given the nature of those proceedings it may well be that the rights and liberties of the public could be better protected by the civil standard of proof.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the criminal standard of proof extends to proceedings which commenced before the date of commencement of the Regulations. If the previous regulation was invalid then the application of the new regulation to existing proceedings raises the possibility that the present regulation could operate prejudicially. The Committee has asked for advice on this possible prejudicial retrospectivity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DETERMINATION NO.1991-92/12 UNDER S.10 GI OF THE AGED OR DISABLED PERSONS CARE  ACT 1954</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DETERMINATION NO.1991-92/24 UNDER S.10 F OF THE AGED OR DISABLED PERSONS CARE ACT 1954</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Determination No. 1991-92/12 formulates Community Aged Care General Conditions for receiving financial assistance under the Act. One provision provides detailed criteria for two public authorities to assess the needs of individuals. Then despite an assessment by these presumably expert bodies applying detailed criteria, the instrument provides that the Secretary may overturn such an assessment. There does not appear to be a requirement for either an authority or the Secretary to give reasons for an adverse decision. Also, on its face, this would appear to be a case for AAT review of such decisions. However, there is no indication in either the instrument or in the Explanatory Statement that AAT review is available.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Again, other provisions empower the Secretary, at his or her discretion, to impose sanctions on certain members of the public. It appears that AAT review may also be appropriate in this case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the above cases involving the exercise of a discretion by the Secretary it appears that the Secretary may delegate all of his or her powers to any officer of the Department.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under another provision a recipient has to "show" that he or she has a certain level of income. There is no indication of to whom this must be shown, or whether there is AAT review of a decision that his has not been shown.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On another matter, the instrument provides in wide terms for a person to indemnify the Commonwealth and its officers. This indemnity includes the cost to the Commonwealth of defending or settling any claim, including those concerning motor vehicles, relating to the administration of legislative programs. The extent of this indemnity may be harsh and unreasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Determination No. 1991-92/24 amends the General Conditions of Recurrent Subsidies and has provisions which largely parallel those of Determination No. 1991-92/12. The Committee is concerned about whether discretions provided in the Determination are subject to external, independent merit review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This instrument also provides that if the Secretary varies an assessment then the variation has effect from the original date of assessment. If repayment is consequently required then such moneys are a recoverable debt. On its face, such retrospectivity operates to prejudice a person other than the Commonwealth and is consequently of no effect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has asked the Minister for advice.</PARA>

<PARA>This urgency motion is not merely about the economic incompetence of this tired, accident prone, faction ridden, divided, hopeless Government and its hapless and helpless Prime Minister, though, heaven knows, it contains those elements in full measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This urgency motion is not just about economics, finance, Budget policy and Budget deficits; it is also primarily about people. It is about the Australian people&mdash;the people in the gallery listening to this debate and the people who may read reports of it; indeed, all Australians. It is particularly about those two million Australians whose self-esteem and livelihoods have been shattered by unemployment and underemployment, and about the families of those two million Australians whose hopes, aspirations and living standards have also been shattered as a direct fallout from the unemployment or underemployment of their fathers and mothers, brothers or sisters, sons or daughters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This urgency debate is about the human misery and hardship that this Government has wrought upon the people of Australia, whether they be the retrenched textile or motor vehicle industry employees, the bankrupted small business people in my own State of Victoria, those desperate for new industrial development in Tasmania or those in rural and provincial centres throughout Australia. The list is endless and it is nationwide. No area has escaped the economic wasteland created by the devastating economic policies and the unbelievable administrative incompetence of, first, the Hawke-Keating Government and, now, the Keating Government. Virtually no Australian has not been touched in some way by the cruel policies and failures of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let it never be forgotten that it is Paul Keating, first as Treasurer and now as Prime Minister, who is the self-professed and self-confessed architect of this barren, devastated and scorched wasteland. It is the same Mr Keating who boasted that he pulled all the levers of economic policy, that he had the Treasury and the Reserve Bank in his pocket and that he was, indeed, the Placido Domingo of Australian politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to Mr Keating that the Australian people do not see him as a Placido Domingo; they see him as the Grim Reaper, the Black Widow, the pariah of Australian politics and the Australian politician who, on his own admission, alone and single-handedly brought this nation and its people to its knees. As Prime Minister, he now believes that he can change Australia and restore Australians and their living standards to the levels down from which he has deliberately dragged them by changing the flag and dropping the Queen. He believes that, if those tactics do not work, spending up big with taxpayers' money and then promising distant income tax cuts to those same taxpayers will do the trick. On top of all that, Mr Keating actually thinks that Australians may believe him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have news for Mr Keating. As he found during the Wills by-election&mdash;although he was hardly in the electorate long enough to draw breath, let alone learn anything&mdash;the people of Australia do not believe him. They have been cruelly deceived too often. They will never forget the promise of then Treasurer Keating two days before the 1990 election that the Government would not let there be a recession, only to find that within a few short weeks&mdash;but too late, because it was then after the election&mdash;Australia had embarked on its worst recession since the dark years of the Great Depression of the late 1920s and early 1930s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This former Treasurer, this now unelected Prime Minister, has no credibility with the Australian people. They simply do not believe what he and his Government say any more. Simply, they have been deceived too often. They have been lied to too often. There have been too many broken promises and smashed hopes and aspirations. When Mr Keating says, `Read my lips: there will be tax cuts in 1994 and 1996', as is outlined in his `One Nation-One Job' statement, the electorate now knows that what he really means is, `Read my lips while I con you and tell you things you want to hear but which I know are undeliverable'. That is what the Australian people think about the integrity and credibility of this Prime Minister and his Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nothing could better demonstrate the reason why Mr Keating and his Government have lost all credibility than the subject matter of this urgency debate. Let me take it in three parts: firstly, the failure of the Government to control the dramatic and progressive blow-out in the Budget deficit; secondly, the Government's consequent inability to fund the spending binge contained in its `One Nation-One Job'&mdash;Mr Keating's job&mdash;statement of 26 February 1992; and thirdly, its inability to fund the so-called income tax cuts in 1994-95 and 1995-96, which is up to four distant years away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Responsible financing of the spending binge and the income tax cuts was never a possibility. In that respect, the `One Nation-One Job' statement was always dead in the water. The dramatic and belated revelation of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) a fortnight ago of a further massive and devastating blow-out in the current year's Budget and in the starting point for next year's Budget has so shot full of further holes the 26 February statement that, like a sieve, it has sunk to the bottom in the waters of impossibility in which it was always marooned. One should not perhaps have expected otherwise from this Prime Minister and his acolyte Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1991-92 Budget and its outturn must rank as the worst in Australia's history. That includes the forecasts of its deficit. You will recall, Mr Deputy President, that we started off in the Budget Papers last August with an estimated deficit of $4.7 billion. In January, only five months later, the Government pushed that deficit estimate out to $5.3 billion. On 26 February, only a month or so later, it went to an estimate of $6.8 billion. It has now gone to a staggering $9.3 billion deficit, and that may not be the end of it. Who knows where it will end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have already had four estimates for the Budget deficit for this year. Certainly the Government does not know what the final figure will be, nor apparently does the Treasury. It is absolutely unbelievable that neither the Treasurer nor the Minister for Finance, Mr Willis, knew in advance of the disclosure on 11 May&mdash;the day of the Premiers Conference&mdash;that the Budget deficit had blown out from the earlier estimate of $6.8 billion to $9.3 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter was discussed in the Estimates committees weeks and weeks ago. Every responsible economic commentator in Australia had said that the deficit would be much larger than the $6.8 billion that the Government was talking about. Yet members of the Government seemed to be the only ones that did not know that that was the case and then expressed surprise when they had to bring out that deficit figure only a couple of weeks ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sheer size of the deficit is enough to justify my earlier statement that the 1991-92 Budget and its outturn must rank as the worst in Australia's history. But that is only part of the story. When one examines the extent of the turnaround in the Commonwealth's budgetary position, the truth of my claim is unassailable. On the Government's own figures, there has been a deterioration in the Budget of $17.4 billion, or more than $1,000 for every man, woman and child in this country, in the last two brief years alone.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Two years ago, in 1989-90, there was an $8 billion Budget surplus. This year, 1991-92, the Government now tells us that there will be a deficit of $9.3 billion, a deficit which is 100 per cent greater than it estimated at the time of the Budget last August. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real situation is even worse because, as you may recall, Mr Deputy President, several fiddles were done in the preparation of this year's Budget&mdash;something that Mr Keating and Mr Dawkins and some of their well-known mates would perhaps euphemistically describe as creative accounting&mdash;which effectively removed a minimum of $4.2 billion from the true deficit on an accurate comparative basis. Therefore, the true situation is that the deterioration in the two short years since the 1989-90 Budget is a mind boggling and, more importantly, nation destroying $21.6 billion. That is almost $1,300 of Budget deterioration for every man, woman and child in a period of two years alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure we all well remember the years of the Whitlam Government&mdash;the years until then of the greatest economic and financial incompetence and damage in Australia's history. The havoc that the Whitlam Government caused to the fundamentals of the Australian economy and the hurt it caused to Australian families and businesses are still with us in many respects. Australia has never fully recovered from those blows. The deterioration in our finances under the Whitlam Government pales into insignificance in comparison with what has happened under Mr Keating's rule as Treasurer and now Prime Minister during the last few years. The tragedy is that the Government does not appear to recognise the direct link between Budget deficits, rising unemployment and falling economic growth. The Budget's rapid progression into huge deficit over the past two years has been accompanied by a collapse in savings and investment, a collapse in production and an increase in unemployment to a postwar record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the Government's own record, how can we ever believe again anything that the Government says about the economy or, more particularly, about its forecasts? Certainly, there can be no credibility in the `One Nation-One Job' statement. The fact is that the One Nation figuring is in tatters. The promised income tax cuts, which were not large anyway&mdash;they were only about $8.5 billion, and that would be a handing back of the bracket creep that the Government was expecting of only about one-third, contrary to the announcement in the Budget&mdash;cannot be delivered, small though they might be. Even the Government has no idea how they will be paid for. On the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program just last week, the Minister for Finance failed to rule out an increase in other taxes to pay for them. So did Treasurer Dawkins in the House of Representatives today. So did Senator Button in response to my question at Question Time today. He refused to rule out upward increases in taxes over the next few years associated with the required funding of the `One Nation-One Job' statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is about time that Labor came clean with the electorate on this matter. Will there be an increase in the wholesale sales taxes to pay for the cuts in income tax? Will the so-called sales tax simplification legislation now in the Parliament be the funding gun for those income tax cuts? Is the proposed increase in the tax on takeaway food containers from 10 to 20 per cent that is in the legislation in the Parliament today a taste of what is to come from Labor? Is the new tax on plastic and rubber sheeting part of the grand and cynical plan for a raft of new taxes to buy the electorate off with an income tax cut down the track in three or four years time? If not, where will the money come from?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, in his answer to my question today, Senator Button cast further doubts on the One Nation tax cut commitments and their financing. We cannot believe any of the figures, the commitments or the promises. Australians have had too much of broken promises from this Government to be fooled again. Perhaps it is just as well that the `One Nation-One Job' statement has sunk without trace. There are fundamental flaws in its strategy, in its assumptions and in its arithmetic. It provides its main stimulus at the wrong time. The main stimulus, according to the statement, comes in 1995-96. How on earth does the Government know that in 1995-96 one will want the maximum stimulus that will be provided in the One Nation proposals if in fact they were implemented?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The One Nation statement provides its main stimulus at the wrong time. It draws on national savings when the major objective of this country must be to increase national savings. One of the two fundamental problems with this nation is that we do not save enough and are not productive enough, do not produce enough, yet this Government is planning to draw down on the national savings by in excess of $20 billion over the next three or four years alone. Its inflation and growth rate forecasts have been rejected by every responsible economic commentator, including implicitly the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank several days ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Far from cutting taxes, as the Government promised in the One Nation statement, it will have to look for more revenue. When we take full account of the Budget blow-out this year, the huge increase in the starting point deficit for the 1992-93 Budget&mdash;that is the one that will be introduced in just four or five months&mdash;and therefore the increase in the starting point deficit for subsequent Budgets, and when we take account of the Budget fiddles to which I have already referred which occurred last year, there is a huge hole in the Government's One Nation figuring. On the most conservative of estimates, that shortfall is at least $23 billion. To finance that $23 billion hole, the Government would require&mdash;if the Government chose to take the sensible course of action of introducing a goods and services tax into this country&mdash;a goods and services tax of about the same rate as proposed by the coalition in its Fightback proposals but without the $33 billion of tax cuts equal to more than $4,000 each year for each Australian corporate and individual taxpayer that are the essential components of the coalition's package of reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamental difference between the coalition's Fightback proposals and the proposals contained in the now dead&mdash;thank heaven&mdash;`One Nation-One Job' statement is that the inevitable consequence of One Nation is an increase in taxes, not a decrease in taxes, an increase in inflation and unemployment and a decrease in economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One Nation has been a monstrous deception from the outset. The figures do not add up, the assumptions are false and the strategy is wrong. The drastic escalation in the already massive deterioration in the Budget that has been occurring consigns the One Nation statement to the scrap heap of history. In doing so, it will also consign its author, Mr Keating, and his job, for which it was designed, to the political scrap heap along with the rest of his Government. In the interests of all Australians, that cannot happen soon enough. We have all suffered far too much and for far too long. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real problem with Senator Short's speech was that nobody would have understood what it meant, including Senator Short. It is a very difficult speech to reply to. It is the sort of speech he should send to his mother-in-law or grandfather, if he has one, to take instead of a Mogadon at night. That is why nobody can draw comfort from the by-election in Wills. That speech represents the Opposition in this country; that speech represents where it would take this place&mdash;into this fantastic fantasy rhetoric, but with little substance or nothing which excites the imagination of the Australian people. That is very sad for this country. I would be much happier if the Opposition were better than it is. At least that would offer some hope to people if there were a change of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I read the text of the urgency motion because I thought that is what I would have to address, not all the rhetoric about the horrors of the Whitlam Government and last year's Budget being the worst Budget in terms of its forecast in the history of Australia. I remember the 1982 Budget. Not only were the forecasts of the deficit dramatically wrong, but the forecasts of everything else were a disaster. That is why the Liberal Party found itself going to an election in 1983 with double digit inflation, double digit unemployment and high interest rates after a big expenditure Budget in 1982. Senator Short's memory should not be too selective. If he talks about the 1991 Budget, he should remember the 1982 Budget. People remember these things. The urgency motion states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The failure of the Government to control the dramatic and progressive blow out in the Budget deficit, and its consequent inability to fund its One Nation&mdash;One Job spending binge and its tax cut promises.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not like the word `binge'. I do not mind governments in this country spending money on jobs and job creation. The word `binge' is a bit of rhetoric. Of course, it is not news, as Senator Short pointed out, that the Government has already acknowledged the Budget deficit for 1991-92. The starting point for 1992-93 when we put the Budget together later this year will be higher than anticipated at the time the One Nation statement was delivered in February. That is a sad thing; it is true. The increase is from $6.8 billion at the time of One Nation to $9.3 billion now. That is a change in the deficit from 1.8 per cent to 2.4 per cent of GDP. The starting point for the 1992-93 deficit is $10.5 billion, about 2.5 per cent of GDP. </PARA>

I am glad about that because I have to respond to all the figures that he went on with. I want to put what I have to say on the record. I will not send it to anybody, but I want it to be clear what the Government's position is on this. The starting point for the 1992-93 deficit is $10.5 billion, 2.5 per cent of GDP. Madam Acting Deputy President, I know that you are interested in these matters. This deficit should be kept in perspective, in proportion. The deficit of 2.5 per cent of GDP is much smaller than the 4.1 per cent of GDP which this Government inherited in 1983-84. If the economy is bigger and the Government has a larger deficit, it has to be taken in proportion with that bigger economy. We had a much smaller economy in 1982-83.</PARA>

That is what happened in 1982. This deficit is not due to any blow-out of expenditure. Forecast revenue collections have deteriorated, as I said earlier, from 24.8 per cent to 24.3 per cent of GDP. The decline in revenue reflects a decline in forecast income. The causes of that are a weak economy, lower than previously expected inflation and lower interest rates. Lower than expected inflation and lower interest rates&mdash;that is why there is a decline in income.

While lower inflation, of course, has major economic benefits, it does have an adverse effect on any Budget in the short term.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the substance of the matter. The Budget deficit was predicted to be $4.7 billion. This was, as usual, questioned by the Opposition, and Access Economics cast doubt on the accuracy of the estimates. We knew quite early in the year that the estimates were too optimistic. Mr Willis, during his short time as Treasurer, made the observation that something had to be done to get the recovery going. Then we had Mr Keating, and he set about doing something. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The One Nation economic statement, obviously in response to the initial success of the Fightback package, set out the measures which this Government proposes to undertake over the next four years to stimulate the economy and to win the next election. One Nation contained a revised Budget deficit estimate of $6.2 billion. We said at the time that many of the figures in the document, especially the growth and current account estimates, were hopelessly optimistic. We now have the revelation that Commonwealth revenue has collapsed even more than expected, and we are looking at a deficit in excess of $9 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the deficit blow-out is not simply due to any irresponsible spending initiatives in One Nation; it has come about because of, amongst other things, the collapse in inflation. This has seriously impacted on PAYE collections because of less bracket creep. Add to that the windfall that was expected with property income and the tax file number system which has not materialised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been some additional discretionary outlays from the former Prime Minister's rather pathetic jobs statement and the One Nation initiatives. But this accounts for less than $1 billion of the budgetary blow-out that we are talking about. These additional measures include additional family payments, additional training initiatives and various infrastructure measures.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We think all of these are worthy of public spending. They are not binges and we do not oppose them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The total increase in outlays under One Nation is $2.3 billion, and most of this falls in the next financial year. But this represents only half a percentage point of GDP in extra spending. It is totally affordable and cannot accurately be classified as a spending binge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us turn to the tax cuts. The tax cuts promised in the One Nation statement are another matter. These will cost $3.4 billion in 1994-95 and $5.2 billion in 1995-96. By 1995-96, the Budget is supposed to be balanced again because of the phenomenal growth estimates and other optimistic assumptions in the One Nation package. But the Prime Minister has admitted that the tax cuts are simply to be funded by bracket creep. His scorched earth, high interest rate policies have all but eliminated inflation at the moment, and the bond market is showing us that inflationary expectations are also declining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This lower than expected inflation result and overstated growth forecast will mean that the One Nation income tax cuts cannot be funded. That is why we have sought to correct and amend the urgency motion. Indeed, it may be better if tax cuts are never delivered because really they are very regressive. Only people earning over $20,000 get any benefit at all, and such cuts further erode the progressivity of income tax scales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we do not agree with the Opposition's fiscal policy either. Let us not get too paranoid about deficits in principle. The Commonwealth deficit and the State deficits are automatic stabilisers in the economy. At different points in the business cycle the public sector's budgetary position automatically adjusts. As economic activity increases, tax receipts tend to rise and social security outlays tend to fall, thereby reducing deficits or even moving a Budget into surplus. Similarly, as economic activity declines, tax receipts decline and social security payments increase. So it is absolutely normal that if economic activity is less than that which the Government estimated while producing a Budget, the deficit will be larger than originally estimated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Budget was brought down, the Opposition complained that the $4.7 billion deficit was irresponsible. Does that mean that the Opposition would have delivered, and will always deliver, a balanced Budget? At the time, it was pointed out that this strategy&mdash;that is, a strategy of reducing government expenditure by about $5 billion&mdash;would have cost 46,000 jobs. Given the further blow-out to $9 billion, a balanced Budget would probably have cost about 100,000 jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We might think this is a socially responsible solution. But the Opposition should learn from history. What it is proposing is a 1990s version of the greatest fiscal mistake in Australian history&mdash;the so-called Premiers' plan which was imposed on the Australian people because of the wishes of Australia's creditors, the ultraconservative and independent central bank which, by the way, the Opposition wishes to revive, and most heads of government in Australia. This involved a supply side solution to the weak economic activity of the Depression. Government spending was cut by 20 per cent&mdash;if in doubt, cut government spending!

When private investment collapses, the correct response is for public investment in, say, transport, communications and public housing, to be increased to try to stem a total collapse in demand and to keep the economy in reasonable health. So we do not subscribe to selling everything off for one little boost, and cutting all government spending. In addition, there is the previously mentioned fact that the Budget is an automatic stabiliser and, as such, the underlying deficit will vary, depending upon the macro-economic environment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The subject of this urgency motion, which is the failure of the Government to control the dramatic and progressive blow-out in the Budget deficit and its consequent inability to fund its `One Nation-One Job' spending binge and its tax cut promises, is clearly identified by the figures that have been released recently as regards the massive blow-out in the Government's financial position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In responding to the remarks of my colleague Senator Short who moved this motion, Senator Button really had very little of substance to say. He claimed that the Opposition could draw no comfort from the result of the Wills by-election. He did acknowledge that his own Government could not draw any comfort from the Wills by-election. But I put it to this chamber that it is the Government which was severely embarrassed by the by-election because Wills is a blue ribbon&mdash;or perhaps it is more appropriately described as a red ribbon&mdash;Labor seat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was expecting a great deal of strongly traditional Labor voters to cast a vote for the Liberal Party in that by-election, notwithstanding the level of dissatisfaction which was obviously evident with the present Labor Government, especially when they had other alternatives for whom they could cast their vote, most notably in the form of the independent Labor candidate who won that seat, Mr Cleary, the local football hero. Given the presence of those alternatives, for Labor voters to move right across to the Liberal Party was a very great expectation indeed. The key point is that they deserted the Labor Party in droves. If we want to see some by-election results that perhaps more accurately reflect the general state of the parties as regards public opinion, let us have a look at the two by-elections for the State Parliament of South Australia a couple of weeks ago where in fact&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Kernot" NAMEID="XW4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FF4">Senator CHAPMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Kernot says, the Democrats outpolled the Labor Party. The Labor vote was halved in the State electorates of both Kavel and Alexandra in South Australia by 11 or 12 per cent. That is a salutary rejection not only of the State Labor Party in South Australia but of the Federal Labor Government. In those by-election campaigns the Labor Party campaigned on the Federal issue of the Opposition's GST policy and in fact asked the voters of those two State electorates to reject the Liberal Party and to reject the Liberal Party's proposed goods and services tax. The voters did nothing of the sort. The Liberal vote was sustained in both those by-elections and, as I said, the Labor vote was halved to finish up lower on first preferences than even the vote of the Australian Democrats. So there are two by-elections which more accurately reflect the attitude of the voters to the two parties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Button also claimed that the Liberal Party in this motion was hankering back to the 1960s. He claimed that Budget deficits under Liberal governments in the 1960s were of a similar order to the Budget deficit that will be experienced this year. However, he selectively chose which years he produced to the Senate, completely ignoring&mdash;as Senator Campbell interjected&mdash;other years in the 1960s which showed a much lower Budget deficit as a proportion of GDP, mostly being of the order of one per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Button also put the argument that the blow-out in the Budget deficit was not due to a blow-out in government expenditure but rather to a loss of revenue. The blow-out in this deficit is of the order of $4.6 billion, yet the fall in revenue, on the figures that Senator Button produced, is only of the order of $2.6 billion. So quite clearly there is a significant contribution to the blow-out in this deficit as a result of a blow-out in government spending. The real tragedy of the present budgetary situation is that it represents a massive turnaround in the Government's budgetary position, and that is something that Senator Button completely ignored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just two years ago in the 1989-90 financial year the present Government managed to achieve a Budget surplus of $8 billion. We are now heading for an estimated Budget deficit of $9.3 billion&mdash;a massive turnaround in just two years of $17.3 billion. That is the real point at issue. Senator Button referred to percentage of GDP when he claimed that the present Budget deficit was a relatively small proportion of GDP. The turnaround represents 4.6 per cent of this country's gross domestic product from that Budget surplus a couple of years ago to the massive deficit of this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real implications of that are shown by the fact that that represents an even bigger Budget blow-out than the Budget blow-out in the period of the Whitlam Government between 1973-74 and 1975-76&mdash;a similar two-year period&mdash;in which the turnaround was only 4.2 per cent of GDP compared with the present two-year period where that turnaround is a massive 4.6 per cent of GDP. So the much maligned and justly maligned economic mismanagement of the Whitlam era is being revisited on us now with this even greater turnaround in the Budget deficit as a proportion of GDP. That is the issue of great concern to the Opposition, and that is why we have raised it in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are saddled with this disgraceful debt because the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has been completely unable to manage or control the economy with even a basic, rudimentary competence. The Government and its advisers appear, to all intents and purposes, to have constantly underestimated the depth of the recession which they created. As the Government said, it is the recession we had to have, and it has been guilty several times over the past year of prematurely predicting an economic upturn. Now, of course, it has been shown to have grossly misjudged the impact of the recession on both revenue&mdash;especially revenue derived from provisional tax&mdash;and expenditure. So we have constantly seen these revisions of what the deficit outcome was to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Budget Papers last August the Budget was predicted to be $4.7 billion. Earlier this year when the One Nation statement was handed down, that prediction was amended to $6.8 billion. Now, only a couple of months later, we see another amendment to a massive deficit of $9.3 billion. So much for the Government's forecasting and so much for the Government's economic competence. What this really means is that the Australian economy has lost about $6 billion more in economic activity than the Government's own experts predicted. So the Government is collecting less revenue and is paying out more on expenditure, particularly on welfare benefits, than it had expected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legacy has been left to Australians by the obnoxious duo of the smug Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and an irritating former Treasurer and now Prime Minister who seem capable only of dropping eminently forgettable one-liners on the Budget blow-out such as `This is a deficiency for all the right reasons' when commenting on the extent of the blow-out. When they make comments such as that, how can the people of Australia take this Government seriously? They cannot and they will not. How can the people of Australia believe that the groundwork laid out in One Nation as a policy document will ever work? Of course, they cannot and they will not. That will certainly be demonstrated at the next Federal election due now in less than 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The spotlight is now clearly on the Government to demonstrate and establish how its One Nation statement can and will work smoothly, and of course the key argument of the Opposition in this debate is that the Government simply cannot do that. This massive blow-out in the deficit completely destroys the credibility and capacity of the One Nation policy document. Quite simply, the Government has its numbers wrong to the tune of $10 billion and its sums will not add up. This is quite significant in the context of the minor nitpicking that the Government has embarked upon with regard to the coalition's Fightback proposals where the numbers do add up and are quite sustainable, most importantly because Fightback, unlike One Nation, is fully funded through tax reform and cuts in Government expenditure. It is too late now for this Government to do anything to effectively enhance its reputation as an economic manager before it faces the people at the next election. It has been simply riding on the coat-tails of this now discredited One Nation statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can the Government claim that One Nation will still be plausible when it is now nearly $4 billion or about 60 per cent worse off in terms of its budgetary position than it was when the statement was heralded with such pomp and ceremony about three months ago? In a short period of just 12 weeks, this Government's policy position is rotting, leaving the Government in real trouble. No amount of glib rhetoric or back-pedalling will now save the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister's planned tax cuts, which were the gigantic carrot to be offered to the voters, have now paled into insignificance because they simply cannot be delivered, even if the Government were to remain in office&mdash;but, of course, it will not have the opportunity to deliver those tax cuts. As I said, by the time those tax cuts were due to be delivered, the Government, on the basis of its present economic management, would be facing an accumulated Budget deficit of the order of $20 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that basis, the motion that has been put to this chamber tonight by the Opposition is clearly sustainable. It warrants the support of this chamber, particularly the Democrats. I urge all honourable senators, but particularly the Democrats, to support this motion, which clearly sheets home to the Government the blame for its economic mismanagement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon Senator Short gave notice of a motion criticising the Government over a claimed blow-out in its Budget. The motion also claims a spending binge on behalf of the Government. Of course, this is a very clear case of the pot calling the kettle black. It is clearly inconsistent and hypocritical for the Opposition to move a motion claiming a blow-out in Government spending when it conveniently forgets and overlooks its own appalling track record of financial mismanagement at the Commonwealth level. Honourable senators opposite had an appalling record in budgeting. The forecasts for their Budgets were way off track in relation to the actual outcomes. Of course, the most significant case in point was the 1982 Budget. Remembering that particular Budget, I oppose this urgency motion tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Campbell was not here in 1982. I was not either, but I certainly took very great interest in the 1982 Budget, because the outcome was a massive blow-out compared with the forecast. I want to go into some detail about the 1982 Budget because it shows clearly just how much tonight's motion is a case of the pot calling the kettle black. On Budget night in August 1982&mdash;I think you may have been here, Madam Acting Deputy President; I did not have the privilege&mdash;the forecast was for a $1.6 billion deficit. By early 1983&mdash;I think Senator Chapman was here&mdash;it was common knowledge around Canberra that, in fact, the deficit was to be $4,000m. So, it started at $1,600m and it was common knowledge within five months that it would be $4,000m. But, of course, worse was in store because that Budget for 1982-83 built in an incredibly high expenditure base following the promises made by Mr Fraser and the then Treasurer, Mr Howard&mdash;who is now a senior front bencher in the Opposition&mdash;to try desperately to win government in 1983. The result was that, by 19 January 1983, the Treasury actually wrote to Mr John Howard, the present shadow Minister for industrial relations, telling him that the Budget deficit in prospect for the 1983-84 financial year could be as high as $8,000m.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, Senator Chapman was here, but he is now trying, as Senator Short did, to rewrite history by claiming that the 1991 Budget was somehow the worst from this point of view. To get back to the history, by 19 January 1983 it had gone up to $8,000m. But, of course, history continued and by 28 February the Treasury&mdash;in the person of Mr John Stone, whom you knew fairly well when he was in this chamber, Madam Acting Deputy President; he was a National Party senator here but then he was the head of the Treasury&mdash;wrote to Mr John Howard, a frontbencher in the present Hewson shadow Ministry, saying that the prospective deficit for 1983-84 would not be $8,000m but $9,000m, a further blow-out in the deficit. But that was not the end of the story. On Friday, 4 March 1983, Mr Stone, as he then was, later Senator Stone, again contacted Mr Howard&mdash;this was the last Friday of the Fraser-Howard Government&mdash;and told him that the deficit in fact would not be $9,000m but $9,600m. That was the actual outcome from decisions taken in August 1982 when the people of Australia were told that the Budget deficit for 1982-83 would be $1,600m. That outcome&mdash;that $9,600m deficit for 1983-84 in the Forward Estimates&mdash;was equivalent to over 4 per cent of Australia's gross domestic product, our national income. That is a massive figure. In terms of 1982 dollars purchasing power compared with that of today's dollars, that is an enormously large figure when compared with any Budget deficit figure in the present day and age.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is, of course, that in government the Liberals could not deliver Budget surpluses. That was the fact of life of the Fraser-Howard Government. After years in office there were no Budget surpluses to talk about. But, of course, this Labor Government has had four consecutive Budget surpluses, from 1987 through to 1990-91. In this particular financial year, and in this motion today, we are considering the One Nation statement, but there is no spending binge in the One Nation statement. Senator Short should ask the families that have benefited from the family allowance payments&mdash;the $125 payment for one-child families that was made early in April&mdash;about the spending binge in the Budget. He should ask the people who have been given an extra $3 a week under the family allowance supplement program. I know where the money has been spent. It has not been a binge; it has been spent in the school clothing and footwear shops of Australia. If Senator Short asks any of those families they will not tell him that there has been a spending binge in recent years through the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that, basically, the increase in the Budget deficit reflects a diminishing revenue available to the Commonwealth Government. That is clearly on the record. The deficit has gone from $6,800m at the time of the One Nation statement to $9,300m now. It is important to relate those figures to the size of the Australian economy. They should not be examined in isolation. Even the deficit of $9,000m is approximately 2 1/2 per cent of Australia's gross domestic product or national income. That is certainly well below the figure that was in prospect for 1983-84 as a result of the Fraser-Howard mismanagement during 1982 when the deficit would have been over 4 per cent of Australia's gross domestic product. Yet Senator Short earlier this evening claimed that the 1991 Budget was somehow worse than those Budgets in the early 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly there has not been an expenditure blow-out. In fact, the increase in the Budget deficit has resulted from diminished revenues. The forecast revenue earlier this year was $96.6 billion. That has gone down to $94 billion. That is a fall of $2.6 billion, which I note is fairly similar to the increase in the deficit over the period since the bringing down of the One Nation statement. It is also very important to note that revenues in the Budget have in fact now fallen to 24.3 per cent as a proportion of gross domestic product. That figure is very low in terms of the recent history of this nation. Typically, Budget revenues, as a percentage of Australia's gross domestic product, have been in the high 20s. We now have a likely figure for this year of 24.3 per cent. I simply refer honourable senators back to the track record of the Liberals. In 1981-82 Budget revenues were 25.9 per cent of Australia's gross domestic product. In 1982-83 Budget revenues were 26.1 per cent of Australia's gross domestic product. So 1992's figure, as we have it now, is well below those at 24.3 per cent. Of course, the Liberals want to have it both ways. They want to claim that the Labor Party is a high tax party. That is part of their rhetoric. But the reality is that, of this nation's gross domestic product, Labor is taking 24.3 per cent in revenue this financial year for the Budget; the figures for the last two years of the last Liberal Government were 25.9 per cent and 26.1 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, today I bring before the Senate a Bill to implement the Government's foreshadowed reform of product liability. The Bill represents the culmination of a process of legislative development which began over 5 years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sorry state of Australia's existing product liability laws has been the subject of reports from the National Consumer Affairs Advisory Council, the Australian Law Reform Commission and the Industry Commission. All accept that an irresistible case exists for updating and simplifying the existing law. We need a system which promotes economic efficiency and provides justice to victims who suffer loss caused by defective products.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Internationally too, the need to make a manufacturer strictly liable for its defective products has been recognised in the development and implementation in the European Community of the 1985 EC Product Liability Directive. Indeed, the EC Directive appears in fact to be the emerging international standard for product liability legislation. I understand that, in our own region, the Governments of Japan, South Korea and Taiwan are also showing a clear interest in introducing legislation based on the Directive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In December last year I brought the Trade Practices Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991 before the Senate. That Bill followed the 1985 EC Product Liability Directive in all important respects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite the extensive debate on this issue which had already occurred, I believed it was important to allow all interested parties adequate time to examine the terms of the Bill before it was debated. I therefore decided to introduce the Bill in December as an "exposure draft" and allow it to lie on the table over the Christmas recess. I undertook to conduct a full and comprehensive process of consultation and encouraged all who had an interest in the Bill to examine it carefully and provide any comments which they wished to make.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have since received a great many submissions from a wide variety of sources, including consumer groups, peak industry bodies, commercial organisations, businesses and interested members of the public. These were of great benefit in considering the extent to which the language of the Bill met the policy objectives. A number of the suggestions and matters highlighted in the submissions have been taken up in the further development of the Bill and I thank all those who have taken a genuine interest in this matter for their input into the process of the development of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have chosen to proceed with the changes to the 1991 Bill by withdrawing that Bill and introducing a clean Bill rather than by way of moving a series of Government amendments. As I stated in my second reading speech in December last year, I believe that this reform is the most significant legislative development in the reform of consumer protection in recent times. It will assist all those with an interest in this matter to have access to a clear, consolidated Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similarly, given the significant reforms introduced by this Bill, the Explanatory Memorandum is likely to be important in the development of the body of jurisprudence which will surround the new regime. It will therefore be beneficial for one definitive explanatory document to be produced to prevent confusion in the interpretation of the new legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Features of the Bill</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The key features of the Bill are as follows.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A manufacturer or importer of goods is to be strictly liable for defects in those goods. Goods are defective when they do not provide the degree of safety which persons generally are entitled to expect, taking into account all the circumstances including the way the goods were marketed or labelled, and the likely uses to which the goods will be put. This is an objective test: it is the objective knowledge and expectations of the community which determine whether a product is defective, not the subjective knowledge and expectations of the claimant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The claimant will not have to prove negligence. The difficulty in proving negligence is one of the factors identified in existing law which can lead to injustice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A product will not be held to be defective simply because a better, safer product is subsequently put into circulation. This should ensure that the regime does not stifle product development or innovation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where a defect in a product results in someone being killed or injured, or where an individual's property is damaged as a result of a defect in goods, the manufacturer or importer is liable to pay compensation for that loss without the need for the person to prove that the manufacturer was negligent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The claimant will have to prove on the balance of probabilities that the product supplied by the manufacturer was defective, and that the defect in the product was the cause of the loss.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a matter of public record that my intention in introducing this regime is that Australian consumers who are injured by defective goods should be placed in a position which is no less advantageous than that enjoyed generally by their European counterparts in the same situation. While on paper the EC Directive places the burden of proof of all elements of the claim on the claimant, it should also be recalled that it was prepared on the understanding that Member States would continue to utilise their existing rules of evidence and procedure in dealing with cases brought under the Directive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In practice this means that, in many EC countries (including United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, France and Italy), claimants have the advantage of a variety of procedural and evidentiary devices which assist plaintiffs to make out their cases. In some countries, it is said that the effect of these local rules will go so far as to shift the burden of proof entirely on a number of key evidential issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In contrast, under this proposal, it is clear that the onus of proof on the issues going to liability remains firmly with the injured person. Nevertheless, it is the Government's firm hope that in applying this legislation in the Australian context the courts in this country will wish to acquaint themselves fully with both the emerging jurisprudence in Europe and these procedural and evidential matters. It is vitally important that the interests of consumers and manufacturers alike be protected by ensuring that the new Australian law operates in a manner which is consistent with the laws in the marketplaces of our major overseas trade competitors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This issue will be the major challenge facing the courts as they come to terms with this new legislation. And, for reasons I will give in a moment, it will continue to be an issue for the Government and this Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill provides a number of defences. Manufacturers will not be liable if they can show that the existence of the defect was incapable of being ascertained by any means (the `state of the art' defence), or where the defect came into existence after the product left the manufacturer's control. A component manufacturer can escape liability if it can show that the component was only `defective' because of the design, markings, instructions or warnings of the product in which the component was incorporated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The manufacturer will also not be liable where the product was defective only because it complied with a mandatory standard imposed by a government. Where the sole cause of a defect was compliance with a mandatory standard imposed by the Commonwealth Government, the Commonwealth will be liable to compensate the claimant for the loss.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In line with the EC Directive and the recommendations of the Industry Commission, compensation can be reduced or disallowed to take account of any acts of the claimant which contributed to the loss.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Trade Practices Commission will be empowered to take representative actions on behalf of one or more consumers who have a product liability claim. However, the Commission will be required to obtain the prior consent in writing of those claimants whom it is to represent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reference of issues to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I have already said, the Bill which was introduced last December followed the EC Directive in all important respects. However, I have never believed that the Directive represented the `ideal' product liability legislation. On the contrary, in many ways it represents the inevitable result of an attempt to achieve uniformity where a number of disparate interests are involved&mdash;a `lowest common denominator'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senators will be aware that the Bill introduced last year significantly differed from the EC Directive in three important areas:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the period of repose was extended from 10 years to 20 years in the case of personal injuries;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Opposition to these elements threatened to once again delay the introduction of this important legislation and perpetuate the inequities recognised by all to be part of the current system. And as I have already noted, injured Australians have already waited five years while this matter has been under consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rather than allow further delay to occur, the Government has decided that the best course of action is to remove the controversial elements of my proposal for consideration by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These matters can now be examined in an objective and constructive way by an all party committee of the Senate. This will provide the proper forum for those who have expressed concerns to articulate their views in a public way. It will also allow consumer groups to put their case publicly from a position of equal standing for the first time since these reforms were proposed. I am confident that in such a forum, a range of issues which have hitherto been the subject of misapprehension can be dispassionately examined and that the true balance between the interests of consumers and manufacturers will become clear to all.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am satisfied that the enactment of these proposals will still represent a considerable advance for consumers and achieve my fundamental goal of getting the new foundations for product liability law firmly in place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill primarily confers legal rights upon individuals to institute legal proceedings. No direct increase in public expenditure is required to administer the regime. There may be a need to consider increased funding for the Federal Court and the Trade Practices Commission if product liability becomes a significant part of their workload, but this is not likely to occur for some considerable time, if at all.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There may be costs arising from the imposition of Commonwealth liability for products which are defective solely because they complied with a mandatory standard imposed by the Commonwealth. The impact of Commonwealth liability for defective standards, however, is not expected to be great.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will ensure that it is the person who was responsible for putting the defective goods into circulation who will be liable to compensate those people who are injured because of the goods. This will benefit the whole community. There will eventually be some increased cost to business as a result of the new law. However, European experience under a very similar regime has shown that this cost will be almost imperceptible in the initial years and very gradual after that. The Bill will also undoubtedly encourage improved design, evaluation and enhanced quality control.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will not only create a more equitable system of rights, but will also improve Australia's overall economic efficiency. Australian manufacturers will be required to produce goods which meet this international standard as part of their push to achieve international competitiveness. I also believe that Australian consumers are entitled to the same level of protection as is available to consumers where the EC Directive operates.</PARA>

<PARA>The Industry Commission Report No. 22 is a very important report. It is the review of overseas export enhancement measures. It is the final report consisting of two volumes, the first being the report and the second being a very important volume of country studies in terms of the overseas export incentives given in several other countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report looks at how governments of Australia's major trading partners and competitor economies encourage exports. It assesses the impact of the measures and considers any lessons for Australia. There certainly are some very important lessons to be found in this report. In particular, the report notes how the Government's failure to reform taxation is harming exporters. There could be no clearer endorsement of the coalition's policy to remove the raft of taxes, such as the wholesale sales tax, payroll tax and fuel excise. In total, as the Senate would be aware, the coalition proposes to abolish $20 billion worth of such taxes which are so harmful to the competitiveness of our exporters. Under the coalition's comprehensive tax reform, exporters, of course, will also be exempt from the goods and services tax and, therefore, will be major beneficiaries of those reform proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report makes it abundantly clear that Australian exporters are being disadvantaged because of the Government's failure to lower the tax burden on business and introduce a broad based uniform goods and services tax. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some taxes are imposed on Australian exporters that are not matched internationally, especially because of the prevalence of value-added taxes. The Australian tax system should not reduce export competitiveness more than is absolutely necessary. This means ensuring, among other things, that taxes on inputs used in exports are minimised.</PARA>
<PARA>In a further clear statement that a goods and services tax is essential to allow business in Australia to be competitive, the Industry Commission says in this Report No. 22:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Favouring exports by exempting them from indirect taxation is also common.</PARA>
<PARA>That is, in other countries. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, most OECD countries (but not Australia) and several East Asian economies have some form of broad-based consumption tax (eg a value-added tax or VAT).</PARA>
<PARA>I spent the last two weeks in four eastern and northern Asian countries. In every one of those countries, amazement was expressed to me at the lack in Australia of a value added tax. The strongest possible endorsement was given to me in all of those countries as to the value of the coalition's proposals to abolish the archaic, inequitable, costly and cost-imposing wholesale sales tax that we have in this country and replace it with a goods and services tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Report No. 22 that we are considering is the sort of report which puts the Government's bona fides totally on the line. The Government now has the task of responding to this report. Will it stick with the present tax system and continue to impose unnecessary burdens on exporters&mdash;as the Industry Commission so rightly points out is the case now&mdash;because the Government is too embarrassed to face up to the fact that the coalition's tax reform package is the only way to go? Or will the Government accept the clear, unequivocal findings of this report, namely, that the Government should admit the error of its ways, abolish the existing ranges of cost-increasing taxes and introduce a broad based goods and services tax as a matter of urgency?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a matter of considerable urgency. We are falling more and more behind the pace in international competition day by day. The cost structure imposed by our tax regime is one of the most important reasons for that. It is absolutely essential that we get on with the job of responsible tax reform in this country as a matter of great urgency. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to add my voice to the voices of many others in the community who object to recent changes in postal charges which have seen outrageous hikes in postal rates, particularly in rural Australia. Country people&mdash;those many thousands of Australians who, for a variety of reasons, choose to live outside the metropolitan areas&mdash;are used to not always having the full range and speed of services that their city counterparts enjoy. They are used to paying more for food and petrol and making the most of their long distance calls. They are used to not having convenience stores and, because of that, they resort to buying things by mail order. Most magazines and newspapers are bought and received on a mail subscription basis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why Australia Post's recent changes to postal charges are so iniquitous to country Australians. Australia Post has introduced a new print post rate which has hit all magazine publishers in this country and affected the profitability of those companies quite severely. The charges have not just moved a little and bear no relation at all to the changes in the CPI. For example, a magazine that in 1990 cost 46c an issue to post, today costs 87c to post to metropolitan areas, 99c to post to country areas and $1.52 to post to interstate country areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those most disadvantaged are country people. Over an 18-month period, the cost of mailing a magazine to country people has risen by some 223.5 per cent. How will any business absorb cost hikes of that magnitude? What family can afford to pay the additional costs? These families will now have to pay these additional costs if they want those magazines delivered to country areas. Why, after years of profitable service, is Australia Post now discriminating as to who gets cheaper mail and who gets dearer mail?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year Australia Post made a profit of $144m. At a time when inflation is at such very low levels, why did it feel the need to do this? Why does the Government allow Australia Post to hit country people so savagely at a time of record bankruptcies and depression? Every week in this place we see yet another example of rural bashing. The Government believes that there are two kinds of Australians&mdash;city and bush&mdash;and that there is no need to worry about the bush vote because the people in the bush do not vote for them. That is an indictment on this Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week I visited the northern electorates of New South Wales. It is pretty evident what the Federal Labor Party thinks of those people. At present they might have Federal Labor members, but they certainly will not last.

I spoke with some of the more than 40 per cent unemployed who have no jobs, and little prospect of getting jobs. That is the reality of country Australia today.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I table the document. I felt obliged to table this document due to numerous calls to my office following a discussion of its contents on a recent <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> program on the ABC. Most of the callers expressed great concern at the fact that a document of such importance was being negotiated behind closed doors. The tabling of this document is designed to bypass such a flawed process and encourage public comment and discussion of its contents. It appears from information that I have gleaned from behind those closed doors that this process has been going on for some time and that it had already commenced whilst debate on the Forest Conservation and Development Bill was still taking place in this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, whilst the Government was attempting to persuade other members of this Parliament to vote for legislative resource security, it was also pursuing negotiations to impose a form of non-legislative or de facto resource security. My response to that coincidence is to suggest that, as the legislative option has now been defeated in the Senate, the Government cannot claim to have a mandate to pursue the non-legislative option. The community has indicated on many occasions its concern to see the protection of the remaining native forests in Australia. The Government should be pursuing policies to reflect that community concern, rather than doing secret deals to satisfy the short term, profit-driven demands of the timber and pulp industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I indicated earlier, my main intention in tabling this document is to provide the public and interested community organisations with the opportunity to openly discuss the concepts raised in the policy statement. Hopefully, it could also encourage the Government to belatedly establish a proper mechanism for input from these groups and rectify the present failure in openness and consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens are committed to the concept of community consultation as a means of allowing the less powerful groups in the community the opportunity to participate in the decision-making process. On a matter of such importance as the future of Australia's forests, it is important that the Government does not limit input to the policy process to those with sufficient power and money to gain direct access to the decision-makers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not comment in detail on the concepts raised in the latest draft of this document, but look forward to the opportunity to participate and provide my viewpoint when the community is given equal opportunity. However, it is appropriate to point to the major failings of the document, quite apart from the question of the policy formulation process. Just as there was a double-handed process of legislative and non-legislative resource security negotiation, there is a doublespeak approach in the tabled document. It adopts the language of ecological sustainability on the one hand, while advocating market-determined management practices for our native forests on the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policy statement continues to stress the concept of resource security, but on an even wider scale than that of the failed legislation. This concept cannot be justified in the context of publicly owned native forests. Rather, those wishing to establish industries based on timber should be creating their own resource security by establishing plantations on privately owned and already cleared land. The major reason for the current push by the timber industry for resource security is its past and continuing failure to plan beyond the short term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the document implies that it is acceptable to clear native forests in order to establish plantations. This concept is absurd. At the commencement of the policy statement it is acknowledged that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the clearing of forests for agriculture has contributed to Australia's economic and regional development, it has also incurred some significant environmental costs including a loss of species, reduced conservation values, soil erosion, and siltation, and in some cases a rising ground water table leading to salinisation and soil degradation. These environmental problems have resulted in a significant economic cost. Clearing has also led to a significant reduction in the greenhouse sink capacity of vegetative cover.</PARA>
<PARA>However, it then goes on to advocate further clearing for a new type of agriculture&mdash;timber plantations. Not only does this prejudice the ecological integrity of vast regions, but also it fails to acknowledge the role that timber plantations can play in restoring the ecological balance in areas already devastated by wholesale clearance of native vegetation for agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a Western Australian, I am also concerned at the implications of some of the comments concerning forest management and protection. For example, the use of prescribed burning by the Department of Conservation and Land Management in Western Australia has been a cause of concern to many conservationists for a number of years. The recent loss of a large area of native forests in the vicinity of Northcliffe in the south-west of WA during a prescribed or controlled burn is totally unacceptable. We cannot, as the Federal Government appears to be doing, accept the forest management practices of CALM as being consistent with forest conservation and the protection of native flora and fauna. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The complexity and importance of the future of Australia's forests is too great to be pursued without extensive community consultation. In conclusion, I urge the Government to cease these secret negotiations on the future of Australia's forests and to implement a comprehensive public consultation process prior to the consideration of the final draft by either the Federal Cabinet or the respective State governments. </PARA>

<TITLE>Taxation: Swap Transactions</TITLE>
<SPEECH PAGE="2668" SPEAKER="Watson Sen J.O.W." NAMEID="VJ4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="TAS">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VJ4">Senator WATSON</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Tasmania)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP> (10.42 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In September last year and subsequently, I addressed the Senate on the subject of the Australian Taxation Office's treatment of swap transactions and, in particular, on the timing of the tax impact of the cash flows that occur in such swap transactions. At the time, I recommended as an acceptable, though not preferred, position that swaps be tax accounted on a daily accrual basis. Up to that point, the Tax Office had been arguing that the cash basis was correct in law and, therefore, that that basis must be applied. However, after extensive industry submissions were made on the matter, the Tax Office has now acknowledged in a final ruling known as IT 2682 that its interpretation of the law was wrong and that daily accruals is now the correct method.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, Mr Deputy President, you may well ask why I am on my feet again tonight. The answer is that in paragraphs 81 to 83 of the ruling the assertion is made that certain swap cash flows, specifically those paid and received in advance, should still be accounted for on a cash basis. I put to the Senate that this exception is bizarre and irrational and that, on the basis of reasoning in the ruling itself, supporting daily accruals is clearly wrong in law because the Tax Office's own logic elsewhere does not support this argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the law is concerned, the ruling supports the daily accruals view on the basis of a sound analysis of the available law on the topic. The crux of the analysis is that the tax law supports in this context the accounting concept of matching, whereby the timing of the cash flows is irrelevant and what counts is the allocation of cash flows to various accounting periods. Thus, the ruling correctly states that it is not appropriate for a deduction to immediately arise because a liability immediately arises to make a later payment. The liability becomes deductible progressively as that liability is transformed into an expense of a future period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, if a bank agrees to pay its investors 10 years' interest in arrears for a loan, that interest liability should be expensed evenly over the 10-year loan period and be deductible on the same basis. It is not deductible today when the liability arises, nor is it deductible in 10 years when the actual cash flow occurs. The court has accepted that when damages were payable in the event of non-performance, that fact supported an operation of the matching principle to spread forward the income recognition over, in that case, the service period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Commissioner points out earlier in the ruling, failure to make a swap payment as contracted for gives rise to a damages claim. But what the Arthur Murray case may or may not have said is really academic, given the first 80 paragraphs of the ruling. The point is that the accounting principles set forth in the ruling do not distinguish between cash flows according to their timing. The basic thrust of the 1984 tax decision, which the Commissioner quotes at great length, is that accounting principles should be followed whether one is looking at a payment in arrears or in advance. That is the issue on which I am taking the Tax Office to task tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the position that I have outlined in law. So it goes without saying, because it is self-evident, that the economic effect in terms of swap pricing is that this hybrid cash accruals basis will have an alarming repercussion because it involves an element of retrospectivity. That ruling makes matters worse still by giving this hybrid treatment of cash accruals a retrospective operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thus, notwithstanding that the Commissioner has clearly accepted that he was wrong to disallow daily accruals accounting for swaps in the past, he nevertheless continues to insist that taxpayers who adopted daily accruals in the past&mdash;that is, the correct method&mdash;must recalculate their tax position by tax effecting advance payments and receipts on a cash basis. This is absolutely ludicrous. This is retrospectivity at work at its worst. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Retrospectivity is unacceptable to this chamber. I believe it is important that the Tax Office should acknowledge the practices and abhorrences that this Senate applies to this concept of retrospectivity. Therefore, in light of this dilemma, I urge the Senate to support the following: firstly, the consistent application of daily accruals tax accounting to all swap cash flows; secondly, a non-retrospective operation for the ruling so that taxpayers who consistently and correctly adopted daily accruals in the past should not have their tax position disturbed; and, thirdly, an amendment of the recent ruling to achieve the outcomes in both the first two recommendations. I urge the Tax Office to examine these propositions and to amend its ruling accordingly. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that, wherever there are Italian citizens who constitute a major minority of the population as they do in Australia, this Parliament should make it known that we pay our respects to a man who was prepared to accept constant daily threats on his life over a significant number of years, who was prepared to take on the apathy over concern about justice that prevailed in many parts of the Italian political system, whose family was threatened on many occasions and who ultimately gave his life to ensure that justice prevailed in a country where significant parts of the regional governments that make up that very interesting country were free from the effect and control of the mafioso. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of us in Australia have been very interested in the developments that have occurred in the last few years in Canberra, particularly in relation to the murder of Assistant Commissioner Colin Winchester. The parallels are not exactly the same when one considers what has happened in Italy. Certainly, I never thought that I would grow up in a country where, for example, an extremely high ranking member of an Australian police force would be murdered in cold blood and that that murder, which appears to have been a professional one, would remain unsolved. There seems to be no indication that anyone is any closer to finding a solution to the problem. I never thought that that would occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The murder of Judge Giovanni Falcone is a timely reminder that in many countries, and even in a country such as this&mdash;which has enjoyed a relatively peaceful relationship between police and the community and which has enjoyed basically an ethos of a respect for the law&mdash;there is a determination on the part of law enforcement authorities to continue the hunt for those people who murder significant figures in the police force or in the judicial system. As I indicated, when Judge Falcone came to Australia he made it very clear whilst he was here that obedience to and respect for the law does not grow overnight. He indicated quite clearly that it is something that can be cast away very quickly with tragic murders such as that of Colin Winchester. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight, I put on the record the respect that a significant number of Australian citizens, especially Australian citizens of Italian descent, want to pay to the efforts of Giovanni Falcone and the courage that he displayed in the face of what many say was an inevitable death&mdash;a threat which was ultimately carried out. On behalf of those people who believe that the tide must turn sooner or later in Italy, especially in Sicily, I say that our hearts and our support go out to Giovanni Falcone's successors in Italy, especially in Sicily, and that the people who take the responsibility for continuing his work there are supported by the Australian Government and by this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wanted to spend some time tonight reminding people that we are all citizens of the world. Especially in a country like this where we have a very large Italian population, we need to be aware of the pressures which exist on a number of those citizens. Giovanni Falcone did not die as just another personality overseas but as someone who had very direct relationships with Australia and who was intimately involved in ensuring that the criminals and the murderers who believed in the past that they were quite free to do what they wished would sooner or later be brought to justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lesson for Australia that we ought to take very seriously indeed is that if one senior important policeman in this country is murdered then we have already approached that situation where the ethos surrounding law and justice that right will inevitably triumph and the concern that we have about people being brought to justice ought to impel us to ensure that an issue such as the Colin Winchester murder should not be allowed to simply fade in our memory. No matter what happens over the next few years, the people who murdered Colin Winchester should be brought to justice, irrespective of the costs or how much effort has to be put into it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Tonight as we respect the memory of Giovanni Falcone, the message we ought to be sending to all the criminals in the community&mdash;and it should be very clear indeed&mdash;is that this Parliament, this Government and the citizens of this community will not rest until Colin Winchester's murderer is brought to justice. I do not think anyone in this place would argue about any amount of money that needs to be spent to achieve that. I thank the Senate for its time tonight. I want to indicate finally that, although this Parliament has not officially paid respect to the memory of Giovanni Falcone, there are a significant number of us here who would like to have that recorded tonight. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to associate myself with that sentiment of Senator Aulich. I would like very briefly, because of the time, to refer to a letter which I have received from Burma. This letter was not sent through the usual channels because letters are heavily censored. It is a letter which paints a very grim picture for the people, particularly the people in the Burmese countryside. It may be that there has been some amelioration of the situation within Rangoon itself. A number of articles in the press seem to suggest that the SLORC Generals and the powers that be in Burma&mdash;we all know that the likelihood is that Ne Win is still the power behind the scenes&mdash;are in some way ameliorating their approach.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appreciate that Senator Gareth Evans, in responses to questions in the Senate, has cautioned the Senate and has cautioned the people not to be overconfident about what is occurring in Burma. I suggest that, given the information that is contained in the letters that I have, that is particularly so in relation to the Burmese people or, indeed, the other people living in the countryside. The suggestion clearly is that most of the outside world does not know what is going on in the countryside. I refer particularly to occurrences in a number of villages. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the villages, ordered to be uprooted, are Catholic villages which have been firmly established for hundreds of years with well built churches, convents, houses and clergy residences. Now, we have the report that all the buildings have been ransacked, things either confiscated or destroyed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Along with inhuman treatments, people are explicitly told to join the insurgents so that the army will pursue and kill them all. Few old people are left back to themselves, having nobody to carry them. Cattle, paddy and properties are being killed&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>obviously, the person who wrote this has a limited knowledge of English&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">taken away or destroyed. The already poor and downgraded people are reduced to zero.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those living near the army are forced to work for the soldiers, sometimes three days a week. Sometimes, they are asked to pay more than Ks. 300/-per month for porters' fees, forced to work in the construction of railway station, rail road, or pay heavily beyond their means. All orders are to be followed otherwise serious actions would be taken, is always the threat. Besides, people, young, old, boys, girls, and even pregnant ones, can be taken at any time for porters or as human shield or mine sweepers. There are some reports that girls are being gang-raped, exhausted porters are being shot or beaten severely.</PARA>
<PARA>Another letter from quite an authoritative source gives a number of details about certain villages. Seventy of those villages, consisting of 12,000 people, have come under harassment. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All villages are given order to move out to the respective townships many of which can be reached only by two or three days on bare foot. . . </PARA>
<PARA>The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Priests and Sisters in the parish centres in Hoya, Ghekaw, Dolaco and Dorawkhu are also to move out within the given time. We do not know what will they do next. But we are sure that many of our people hiding merely out of fear or simply because of difficulties in communication do not hear of the expulsion order will meet a tragic fate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now many have started to move to the assigned locations. But nothing provided for them adequately.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question is, is it the beginning of religious persecution or suppression of minority tribes?</PARA>
<PARA>It gives specific examples. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . In Phruso Regiment No. 428 confiscated a large area of ground attached to the Convent buildings. There was no request, no explanation or even consultation. It was just an order, by the SLORC township chairman Capt. Kyin Tin . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It then gives the order number. Similarly, a letter dated 11 February 1992 gives an order number for the removal of two crosses on two hills as well as the graveyard in the adjacent area. This letter appears to be authentic. It also gives documented details of the numbers and location of people who have been ordered out of their villages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, there is a great deal of harassment and violation of human rights in the countryside as well as in Rangoon. In the countryside in particular, people do not appear to know what is going on. I simply bring that to the attention of the Senate. The people concerned believe that it is religious persecution as well as the persecution of the people at large and of certain tribes in Burma. I believe that it is wise, as Senator Evans said to the Senate, not to make too much of the statements that have been made or the actions that have been taken since the new leader took over. I would be quite happy to talk to the relevant people in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade about this matter. </PARA>

Whether compensation should be paid is a matter to be  determined in accordance with the relevant legislation in place. The policy issues with which this legislation deals are complex and involve the balancing of public interests and increased expense with the claimed damage suffered by those in the immediate proximity of the project.

The Bureau requested that the proposal be included as an Agenda Item for the meeting of the Wet Tropics Management Authority on 14-16 August 1991.

The Government does not itself conduct clinical trials in relation to surgical or other procedures in relation to the Medicare Benefit arrangements, but is advised in relation to such clinical matters by the relevant professional college or association. The surgical procedures for the treatment of breast malignancy continue to attract Medicare benefits because there are items in the Medicare Benefits Schedule relating to such procedures. These items will remain in the Medicare Benefits Schedule, and therefore continue to attract Medicare benefits, while they continue to have the clinical endorsement of the medical profession. It should be noted that removal of any procedure from the Medicare Benefits arrangements would not result in medical practitioners discontinuing with that particular procedure, rather it would remove the entitlement of a patient to a Medicare benefit.
