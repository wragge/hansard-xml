<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Transport and Communications. I refer the Minister to the testimony he gave on 4 March this year in the Meissner case that he had met Mr Joe Meissner as recently as 1986 at the arrangement of a Mr Warren Anderson and that the Minister, in his own car, had driven Mr Meissner around Sydney's eastern suburbs while having a discussion. What interest could a senior Cabinet Minister possibly have in meeting in such a clandestine way a known criminal and standover man who, to the Minister's certain knowledge, had been convicted of stealing Army machine guns to sell to the underworld and who, the Minister claimed in this chamber, had been thrown out of the Australian Labor Party six years previously at the Minister's instigation?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not certain how much it relates to my ministerial duties, but I will give an answer. That was, of course, before I became a Minister and it was at a time when a Mr Gary Sturgess from the Premier's office in New South Wales was wandering around with $100,000 in a suitcase seeking to give that to Mr Meissner, as I understand it, with John Dowd, who was then the Attorney-General, in an effort to get him to say something about me and about the Labor Party. I thought it sensible to inquire as to what the $100,000 might be for and what it might buy. I would also like to find out who gave the $100,000, from where it came and, given that at the end Mr Meissner did not accept it, who got it and where it is now.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1G4">Senator DEVEREUX</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Has the Australian Bureau of Statistics recently published details concerning the level of industrial disputation during January? Can he advise the Senate whether they show that the decline in disputation achieved as a result of the accord is continuing?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2027" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to that is yes. We have now recorded a few records in Australia. January 1992 recorded the lowest total number of working days lost through industrial disputes since the Australian Statistician began measuring that performance. The States of Victoria and Queensland recorded the lowest number of working days lost since the series began and Western Australia recorded the lowest number of working days lost since February 1968.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, to the year to January 1992 only the State of New South Wales performed very badly. Its record was to have industrial disputes running at four times the level of the average for Australia in terms of the number of working days lost per thousand employees. If we disaggregate the New South Wales figure for the major blip that occurred when there was wholesale confrontation in New South Wales over State industrial legislation, New South Wales still has, on a State basis, the worst performance of any State in Australia in industrial disputes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is quite fair to say that this is the continuance nationally of a trend that has occurred under the Labor Government since 1983. Basically it is due to the accord. It is due to the change that we are fostering in the structure of industrial relations as well to what is now coming through increasingly&mdash;an attitudinal change in the workplace to encourage teamwork in place of confrontation and conflict, and cooperation instead of disputation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are signs now around Australia that in the workplaces of this country there is a move to world best practice; that workplace bargaining is beginning to take hold, and the amendments that I propose to make to the Act in the very near future will help to speed up that; that our wages policy has helped to deliver the big `O' in inflation for the last quarter and the very low level of inflation that this country is now enjoying; and that our wages policy settings are directed to locking in that low level of inflation as a permanent feature of the Australian economy, while recognising and addressing the real needs of Australian workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our commitment to training in the One Nation statement will encourage Australian workers to work smarter through better training and better skills formation. In our settings, too, the Industrial Relations Commission&mdash;unlike the Opposition, we do support this independent body&mdash;continues to ensure that fairness and reason prevail in industrial relations, not the law of the jungle as is being advocated by the Opposition. On the basis of the figures that have now been tabulated by the Statistician, we are looking forward, having regard to all of the factors that I have mentioned, to a surge in productivity coming through the economy; to a major productivity surge being evident in the economy in the later part of this year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. I refer the Minister to comments by ACTU Secretary and Reserve Bank board member, Mr Kelty, reported in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, foreshadowing that at tomorrow's meeting of the Reserve Bank board he will support a one per cent reduction in official interest rates.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not read Mr Kelty's remarks in detail. But, from what I have seen of them, I do not interpret them as doing that. Mr Kelty has said certainly that there is room for further cuts in interest rates.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask a supplementary question. I thank the Minister for that answer. But surely he is not equating other commentators with Mr Kelty, who is a member of the Reserve Bank board which has to make that decision. My supplementary question is: given the Prime Minister's close relationship with Mr Kelty, is this another indication of Mr Keating's boast when he was Treasurer that he had the Reserve Bank in his pocket? Will the Minister tell the Australian people just who is running economic policy in this country&mdash;the Government or the ACTU?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LH4">Senator JONES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I refer the Minister to a report in this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> that a group of 27 nations had signed an agreement about new controls on nuclear weapons related materials. What is Australia's role in this process and what is Australia doing more generally to halt the spread of nuclear weapons?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2028" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australia has been playing a very active role in recent times, particularly since the end of the Gulf war, in strengthening the nuclear non-proliferation regime, particularly International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards and controls on nuclear exports. We have also been putting international pressure on North Korea specifically to fulfil the non-proliferation obligations it has entered into.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This morning's newspaper report does refer to the highly successful outcome of the Nuclear Suppliers Group meeting which was held in Warsaw last month. The meeting significantly extended current controls by adopting a new control regime for 65 nuclear dual-use items. It was in this nuclear dual-use area that Iraq was able in recent years to continue purchases and that serious gap in controls has now been closed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The meeting also adopted a common declaration requiring full scope IAEA safeguards as a necessary condition for new nuclear supply to non-nuclear weapons states. That declaration is particularly gratifying to Australia because we have led an international coalition and worked very assiduously on this issue over many years to achieve this result. The meeting called on other nuclear suppliers to follow suit. I might say in this respect that Argentina announced just last week that it had amended its nuclear export policy to require full scope safeguards as a condition of supply. I take this opportunity to urge those remaining nuclear suppliers, notably China, which have not yet adopted a full scope safeguards policy, to do so without further delay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other major focus of that Warsaw meeting was the situation in the former Soviet Union. The meeting made a special appeal to the CIS states other than Russia, which is a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group, to promptly accede to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty as non-nuclear weapons states, to accept full scope IAEA safeguards and to implement effective nuclear export controls. Again, I think it is fair to say that Australia played a leading role in that particular outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The significance of the situation in the former Soviet Union for the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is such that the Australian Government has now been invited to join with the Group of Seven in a major program of visits this month to those states to assist them in designing and implementing controls on the transfer of material, technology or related skills to potential proliferators in other parts of the world. This will cover controls to prevent nuclear, chemical, biological and missile preparation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That Australia has been asked to join the G7 group as an eighth nation in this particular exercise is again, I think it is fair to say, a tribute to the contribution this country has been making to the prevention of the spread of weapons of mass destruction and to the depth of our arms control skill and commitment at an official level in this country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can the Minister for Industrial Relations inform the Senate of the reforms occurring at Email's Beverley plant in South Australia which are designed to transform the Email Major Appliance Group into an internationally competitive whitegoods manufacturer? Is the Email Group a recipient of a grant through the Australian best practice demonstration program to assist the company in that reform program and in the spread of international best practice?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a subject about which parties on all sides of the chamber can rejoice, because here is an Australian company which has concentrated on and succeeded in achieving world best standards and is now an increasingly important exporter out of Australia. In the current climate and tough international market, that is an achievement of which Australia can be proud.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Email-Simpson Pope factory at Beverley in South Australia employs about 500 employees. It is an example of the team-work ethic and there is a cooperative attitude between the work force and management; there is not a `them and us' attitude. It is a multicultural work force and in microcosm is a representation of all of the multicultural communities in Australia. This work force has a low literacy level in the English language, but a literacy program is being run and there is a cooperative mentality which works very well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The workers in this company have redesigned the production line so that it is worker friendly. In doing so, they found that the layout of the production line occupied a floor space which was one-quarter less than the floor space occupied by the production line when it was laid out by engineers, suggesting that the capital investment in the original plant construction perhaps did not need to have been as much. This production line works for the employees who work there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Multiskilling is encouraged and there is advancement by qualification. The production line operates on a series of autonomous work groups which are self-regulating, each group in line being a customer of the group further up the line; so it regulates quality as well. The whole plant is overseen by a closed circuit television communications system, which means that senior board decisions taken at 6 o'clock one evening are known to each worker in the plant by 8 o'clock the next morning on the basis of face to face communication and on the basis of some discussion between their elected autonomous work group leaders and themselves so that management has feedback.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This plant has been judged by the independent panel that distributes world best practice awards as being an example in Australia of a world best practice company. In the Olympic year, it is the equivalent of an Australian company being selected in the Olympic team. This plant is moving towards the formation of a workplace agreement. It will do it in its own time. When an agreement is reached, as I am sure it will, the workers will own it, identify with it, take responsibility for it and make sure that their company is a winner in the international arena.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Email has recently placed a vote of confidence in Australia by announcing expenditure of a further $20m on the upgrading of its refrigeration manufacturing plant at Orange in New South Wales and, when commenting on this announcement, Mr Don McNeill, Email's Major Appliance Group Chief Executive, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in an increasingly open, internationally competitive environment, Australian industry could achieve&mdash;without compromise&mdash;productivity, quality, and flexibility to the highest standards in the world.</PARA>
<PARA>The results at Email are already a spectacular example of that: in the last three years Email has tripled its exports of major household appliances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I began this answer by saying that honourable senators on all sides of the chamber should be pleased about this, because this is one company that is prepared to demonstrate how it reached that internationally competitive position to other Australian companies so that they can emulate and follow it. Email did so without promoting conflict, division or confrontation, the last three words all being metaphors for the Opposition's industrial relations policy.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the period 1984 to 1988, the proportion of rural road fatalities fell from 49.3 per cent to only 48.5 per cent nationally; so, essentially, the proportion stayed the same. Consistent national data is not yet available for later years. From data available from New South Wales and Victoria in 1989 and 1990, rural crashes have fallen only marginally in proportion to the total crashes in New South Wales and have increased slightly in Victoria. However, it must be emphasised that the trend in rural Australia has been to a reduced number of fatalities and serious injuries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1990, the Federal Office of Road Safety undertook a survey of seat belt use in rural areas. Overall, the seat belt wearing rate was pretty high at 94 per cent&mdash;by world standards, that is very high indeed&mdash;and was significantly higher than the previous figure of 79 per cent in 1988. Most non-wearers were found to be locals. Of the people killed in rural road crashes in 1988, 41.5 were not wearing a seat belt, which is a very high figure. Therefore, non-belt users are heavily overrepresented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Northern Territory, around 80 per cent of the car drivers or their passengers killed in 1990 were not wearing seat belts. In its recently published road safety strategy, the Northern Territory Government has indicated that this situation has not changed markedly since 1976. The heavy overrepresentation of non-belt users among fatalities reflects the effectiveness of belts in preventing deaths. Most studies show that we have a 40 per cent less chance of being killed if we wear a seat belt. It also reduces the severity of injuries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Government conducted a major road safety campaign in 1991 aimed at seat belt wearing amongst rural drivers, particularly young males under 30. The campaign used the slogan `Buckle up in the bush'. It was both a television and billboard campaign. It cost about $750,000 and ran for some six months to September 1991. The results were very good. A nationwide study showed that awareness of the campaign was very high, with 83 per cent of people in rural areas aware of it. The figure rose to 89 per cent for the primary target group. In terms of effectiveness, the survey revealed that 3 per cent of respondents who were not regular wearers of seat belts had changed their behaviour as a result of the campaign. That means that lives were saved. In the primary target group of young males, the study reported that there was a positive shift to seat belt wearing of 5 per cent. These changes are particularly significant when it is considered that seat belt wearing rates are very high Australia-wide.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I draw the attention of the Minister for Transport and Communications to reports in the Brisbane media at the weekend that Australia Post plans to close up to 110 offices across Queensland. Is the Minister aware that Australia Post told the Industry Commission that it is the Federal Government's reform program for government business enterprises, announced in 1988, which has acted as the mainspring for Australia Post's current policy direction? Is the Minister also aware that recent changes to Australia Post services are already having devastating consequences in rural communities? Does this proposed action now mean that Australia Post has all but abandoned any concept for promoting public benefit before profit?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators will recall that when this technology was first introduced there was some widespread concern about just how effectively it would operate in relation to the system that it was replacing. I am pleased to advise the Senate that the system is operating with spectacular efficiency. No major problems have been encountered since the installation, in September 1989, of the system of ground facilities for monitoring the global maritime distress and safety system. The system involves the detection by its orbiting satellites of distress signals emitted from emergency position indicating radio beacons&mdash;or EPIRBs, as they are known&mdash;which should be carried by all vessels going to sea.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Occasionally AMSA has encountered unidentified EPIRB transmissions caused by misuse or malfunction of beacons that have necessitated additional checking of the situation by AMSA and State agencies. To save this expense and possible diversion of resources from a real emergency, AMSA urges EPIRB users to periodically check their beacons and ensure that manufacturers' maintenance recommendations for the beacons are followed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AMSA also has an active sea safety education program that provides information on, among other things, the operation of EPIRBs and the satellite aided search and rescue systems. AMSA has advised that, in the 1990-91 financial year, 33 EPIRB alerts were detected in the Australian segment of the satellite system, contributing to the saving of 109 lives. In addition to the obvious contribution to safety of life at sea from the carriage of EPIRBs and the satellite assisted system, the time taken for expensive air searches is reduced significantly because alerting of emergencies occurs sooner and more accurate position information is provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To advise the Senate of just how efficient these systems can be, the most recent example happened a week ago in Queensland with the rescue of three crew members from an overturned Shark Cat craft. The marine rescue centre declared a marine alert at 5 a.m. on the Saturday before last, 25 April, when it detected an EPIRB distress signal through the satellite monitoring system. The overturned craft was located by chartered helicopter and the three survivors were lifted out of the water at 6.40 a.m.&mdash;that is, one hour and 40 minutes after they activated the beacon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The efficiency of this system reduces the risk to those who undertake the actual search and rescue, often in extremely hazardous conditions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has looked at various ways in which child-care can be provided in a fair way in the community. It has looked at tax deductions and rebates as part of the various formulas that might be used in this regard. We have rejected rebates basically because they fail the test of fairness. Clearly, tax rebates or deductions favour those persons putting children into care who are on higher incomes; that follows as a matter of course. Families whose incomes are too low to pay tax receive no benefit from rebates at all. Also, a tax rebate or deduction is of no value to a family which cannot find somewhere to place a child or children.

If anyone in government was ruthless to oppositions in reducing available resources to them, it was Ian Sinclair. But the moment he became the Leader of the National Party in opposition, every week we got letters&mdash;it must be the thickest file we have&mdash;pleading for more VIP flights or stamps or on any other particular issue.

He also said that overseas visitors would have been amazed by the line of questioning. He made that remark because Mr Cheney was in the gallery. I noticed over the weekend that Mr Cheney himself was interviewed on this very issue. A question was raised by a reporter as to what the reaction would be in the United States if this issue was raised. It took Mr Cheney entirely by surprise.

But I do not think debate is enhanced when people come to this issue with a closed point of view. Anyone who had listened to what Senator Parer said before he asked for this debate would have seen quite clearly that the Opposition comes to this issue with a closed point of view. If one analyses the speeches that were made in this place last week on this issue, one sees that the Opposition comes to it with a closed point of view. The only person on the Opposition benches who has spent some time with me discussing this flag, who was prepared to look at alternative flags but who at the end of it said that he was not all that keen to change, was Senator Kemp.

That someone is selling T-shirts out of my office and raising funds as a consequence, quite honestly, should not really merit the time of this chamber.

In that context, I am worried that our flag is so similar to the flags of, for instance, Tuvalu and New Zealand. There is ambiguity about the flag. I am not a great subscriber to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hinch</EMPHASIS> program, but last week the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hinch</EMPHASIS> program went out to the streets of Australia with two flags, one being green and gold and the other being the New Zealand flag.

Indeed, I have an open mind on many issues, but I think the record will show that on some issues my mind is very, very firm indeed, and certainly made up. I cannot recall ever discussing the issue of the flag with Senator Bolkus, let alone discussing it for two hours. I do not think I have ever had a discussion with Senator Bolkus for two hours about any particular topic.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The record of my comments in this Parliament and elsewhere&mdash;in my comments to colleagues&mdash;would clearly show that I am not only a strong supporter of the current Australian flag but also a passionate one. Dr Evatt, a former leader of the Labor Party, described this flag so well as `possibly the most beautiful flag in the world'. That is a sentiment with which I fully concur. I hope this flag long flies over this great country of ours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some remarks which are worth noting in this debate which, thanks to the Labor Party, has become a public debate. When we look at the issues which have concerned the Australian people over the past 20 years, we can recall that on many occasions opinion polls were taken to find out what the Australian public regarded as major political issues. My memory of that process harks back a long time, possibly up to two decades. In terms of the 10 to 15 major issues that have concerned the Australian public, I cannot recall anyone ever raising the issue of the flag&mdash;or, indeed, of the Constitution. So we are left with the fact that this issue has been totally contrived by the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was speaking in the great city of Horsham on Sunday. A person in the audience asked me, `What has changing the Australian flag got to do with the issue of jobs?'. I said, `On the one hand, absolutely nothing; on the other hand, absolutely everything'. I explained by saying that, on the one hand, changing the flag, fundamentally changing our Constitution, would not add one job to the jobs in this country. In fact, through the division and unpleasantness that it would create, it may well even lower the public confidence in our future and we may well lose jobs. But I then said that, on the other hand, it has absolutely everything to do with the issue of jobs. The issue is this: the last thing that Mr Keating wishes to debate as we go towards the next election&mdash;</PARA>

So what Mr Keating has done, with the connivance of the Left of the Labor Party, is try to launch a major diversionary tactic, that diversionary tactic being the suggestion that, for some reason&mdash;because it is no great pressing issue to the public&mdash;we now have to debate our flag and our Constitution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make a few brief comments on that. Australia's history as a Federation goes back almost 100 years. Many great men from both sides of politics have led this country through war, peace and depression. Not one of them has not been proud to fly the Australian flag. Mr Keating is the first Prime Minister of this country who is not proud to fly that flag; he will not fly that flag on his car. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An opinion poll conducted over the weekend shows that two-thirds of the Australian public were very happy with our current flag. Just under one-third would be happy with a change. When asked what they thought of their Prime Minister attacking their flag overseas, 76 per cent of Australians were absolutely appalled that he could go overseas and attack their history, their flag and the institutions of their country. I do not believe that one other leader of our country has done that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To remind the Senate of what appalled people about the behaviour of Mr Keating, I refer to an article which was published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> some weeks ago when Mr Keating, our Prime Minister, was in Jakarta. the article states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"The Asians are entirely confused. They are not sure whether we want to be part of the area.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"To make our way in the world, and particularly this part of the world, we have to be entirely certain of who we are, what we are and what we wish to do.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know which Australians Mr Keating mixes with. The Australians I mix with know who they are, what they are and what they want to do in the rest of the world. I suspect that Asians could not care less about our flag. I have been around for some 47 years and I have never heard an Australian worry about any Asian flag and I suspect, equally, that the Asians are not too worried about our flag. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A flag is not for a foreign country; a flag is for the people of the particular country. That is the issue. I may well ask Mr Keating: who are these Asians who are unhappy about our flag? That would get a very interesting answer. Which countries and which leaders are unhappy about our flag? If Mr Keating named those people, there would be a howl of outrage from Australians and, in my view, rightly so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whatever side of the fence people come down on in this debate&mdash;and let us face it, most Australians and, indeed, almost half of Labor Party voters, according to the latest opinion poll, are strong supporters of the retention of our flag&mdash;they are appalled that their Prime Minister goes overseas and grovels to try to win the respect of Asian countries in our region by attacking our flag. I do not think that the Australian people will ever forget that. We on this side of the chamber will never forget that. We know we have a foreign Minister whose habit it is to grovel to our neighbours'; we thought perhaps we had a man who was leading this country who was prepared to stand up and be proudly Australian. Regrettably, we do not have that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an important debate. It was a debate put on the agenda by the Labor Party. It is a debate causing enormous concern in the community. It is not only a debate about a piece of cloth; it is a debate about a perception of Australia and it is a debate about what we feel about our history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is&mdash;and even those who want a change in the flag will agree with this&mdash;that this flag has flown over this nation for almost 100 years. It has been the symbol of this nation&mdash;the symbol of our language, our culture, and our belief in ourselves. Millions of Australians have felt very warmly and passionately towards that flag. Mr Keating and some of his colleagues&mdash;I say `some' because I believe many of them do not support him in this issue&mdash;now feel that it is time for a change. Because this is a free society, he can debate the matter in the rest of the community. However, people are revolted by the fact that this man can stand up and sneer at a flag that has meant so much to the Australian people. That is why there is a growing concern in the community about the performance of Mr Keating, about his judgment, and about what sort of Australia it would be if we had this immensely divisive man leading this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating is not addressing a public concern&mdash;all the opinion polls have shown that this is not a public concern&mdash;but is trying to lock in behind him the left wing of the Labor Party.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The courage that the Americans showed in support of us, but which we also showed in support of them, was a mutual effort. But so was the effort that we showed when we fought with our allies at El Alamein, with the Rats of Tobruk or in other theatres of war where our courage has been strongly shown. How dare this man who purports to call himself a Minister of the Crown, Senator Bolkus, the Minister for Administrative Services, say that our flag is trivial. How dare he!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The flag is important to me. The flag is important to Australia, just as our Constitution is important to us. If we have a Minister that wanders aimless, flagless and head of stateless and says he does not know who he is, do not purport to speak for me, Sir&mdash;because he does not&mdash;and do not purport to speak for thousands upon thousands and millions of Australian men and women who are proud of their national symbols and proud of this nation and proud to be Australian. All the spruiking forth of the great lie, all the paltry, poor, propaganda that this awful shirt represents, will not make any proud Australian lessen the pride in our nation and in our flag. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So when I rise to support the remarks of Senator Parer in taking note of the disgraceful answer that was given in this place by the so-called Minister earlier this day, I am reflecting the comments that have been made to me, the actions that were shown by the thousands of people who watched the march-past on Saturday, those who prayed together on Sunday and those who value the coming together of allies to fight against an evil and against a common enemy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To be Australian and to live in this great nation makes me one of the luckiest people in the world. When I look at my flag, I remember what it says to me. It tells me about the origins of our system of law, our institutions, this very Parliament in which we sit, the ethics which are reflected in our law making, the fact that we came together as a single unit under Federation, a single nation, in 1901 and then chose by popular choice an emblem, our flag, to represent the things that were then precious to us and remain precious to us today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Labor Party has become the great proponent of the great lie. If members of the Labor Party say a lie often enough they think people will believe it. This time those opposite have erred. All of those on that side of the Parliament have erred. When I was listening to an interview with the son of the man who was one of the successful entrants in designing our flag, although he was scathing of this unelected, flagless Prime Minister, he said, `I know there are many in the Labor Party who don't share his views and I know one Minister who doesn't share his views. Ben Humphreys loves our flag. He was with us in Gallipoli and he loves our flag. He is not one of them'. I dare say that that view is held about other Ministers or other members on that side of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is indeed a sad day when the stocks of this flagless, unelected Prime Minister have fallen so low. Indeed, the polls show that, since he began this attack on our national pride, our national symbols and on our nationhood itself, he has gone down in the polls&mdash;and down is where this unelected Prime Minister will remain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People who enjoyed reading the colour supplement in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> this weekend&mdash;the story of the getting of Hawke, the machinations of people who call themselves Ministers in bringing down Prime Minister Hawke who had led them to victory so that we could have in its place this man who wishes to attack the very foundations of this nation&mdash;will have read it with a cynical amusement. What is the main feature of the illustration on the front cover of that magazine? It is a dagger at the throat of former Prime Minister Hawke. This unelected Prime Minister is putting a dagger at the throat of this nation. There is nothing he will not sacrifice. He will go to foreign nations and apologise for being who we are, hoping that they might somehow like him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who would ever respect somebody who said, `I am going to take down all the portraits of the members of my family who have gone before me because I have decided that I do not like them any more.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this afternoon to support Senator Parer's motion. I find it hard to believe that a Minister of this Government would support an attempt by one of his staff members to raise money for the Australian Labor Party by selling T-shirts that denigrate the Australian flag. Polls have shown that a great majority of people still want the present flag as the flag of our country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Except for a day like today when Canberra was for a time covered by fog, every morning when I wake up and pull aside the curtains I see the Australian flag flying on the great flagpole above our Parliament. The Australian flag is hung behind Labor Party speakers during election campaigns. We see the Australian flag on Labor Party television and press advertisements. I wonder why members of the Labor Party&mdash;people like Senator Bolkus and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)&mdash;are so anxious to change the flag. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian flag contains the Southern Cross. This very nice symbol represents the Southern Cross which can be seen in the sky over this part of the world. The flag also contains the star of Federation which symbolises the States joining together and forming a federation. Then, of course, the flag contains the Union Jack. I believe that the Labor Party and others who want to change the flag really want to get rid of the Union Jack. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is fatuous to argue that the presence of the Union Jack on our flag indicates that it is someone else's flag or that it reflects our colonial status. These arguments show little knowledge or appreciation of history. People who put forward such arguments conveniently forget that a nation is much more than a geographical entity and that it also exists in the context of time and culture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot escape the simple historical truth that the vast majority of early settlers who pioneered, explored and created this country and who developed our modern society came to Australia from England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland. It is nonsense to deny that some Australians came as convicts. We should be proud of our past. We should learn from it and move on to the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Parentage and creed make people what they are&mdash;these elements cannot be denied. British values and standards underwrote Australia's development. Moreover, our early settlers brought with them our basic social and political institutions which have served us well for over 200 years. Our Westminster system of government, both the envy and despair of so many other countries, has come down to us from as far back as Simon de Montfort's first parliament of 1265 AD in England. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In denigrating our British and European origins, some argue that we are part of Asia and that our flag and constitution should reflect this. That, of course, is what the Prime Minister said as he moved around Asia just recently. I do not believe that that is correct at all. Geographically, Australia is closer to Antarctica than it is to South East Asia, which lies almost entirely north of the equator. New Guinea is between Australia and the equator and the people of that country can scarcely be called Asians. These arguments also conveniently forget that other Asian countries, such as Thailand and Japan, are monarchies. Furthermore, Australia is a separate continent. Australia is not a part of the Asian continent. One could argue that neither is the Soviet Union. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our flag was chosen from many thousands of entries in a competition. I have always been proud of our flag.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it hard to believe what my colleagues have said&mdash;that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) refuses to have the Australian flag on his vehicle. I find that absolutely incredible and almost impossible to believe. I only believe it because my colleagues have told me that they have seen this happen. To me, this is the ultimate disgrace&mdash;that an unelected Prime Minister, a man who got to his position by subterfuge and treachery, would dare to attend official functions without flying the Australian flag on his car. He may not be prepared to fly the flag on his car but, in the ultimate of hypocrisy, the Australian flag is displayed prominently on the logo of the Australian Labor Party. I am absolutely sickened when I see that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a situation in which a party that is not prepared to stand up for the Australian flag, a party that is prepared to come into this chamber and, as the Minister for Administrative Services, Senator Bolkus, did, belittle and trivialise the flag, puts the flag on its logo and displays it prominently wherever it can. In the past, the Labor Party has thought that it would get votes out of displaying the Australian flag prominently at Australian Labor Party political functions. I have little regard for the Australian Labor Party. Whatever regard I might have sinks even lower when the Party has the hypocrisy to leave the Australian flag on its logo and at the same time trivialise and denigrate the flag as it does in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not one of the members of the Labor Party opposite is prepared to stand and support the flag as we have done on this side of the House.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The polls have been quoted by my colleagues and I will not continue with them except to say that an interesting sidelight of that poll in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Mail</EMPHASIS>, the Quadrant poll, shows that the unemployed want to keep the flag&mdash;by a percentage in excess of the national average. Some 70 per cent of those unemployed polled want to keep the flag as it is. Some 74 per cent of those unemployed polled disapproved of the way the Prime Minister chose to talk overseas about changing the Australian flag and some 94 per cent of the unemployed indicated that they wanted a referendum to be held before the Labor Party took steps to change the flag. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that unemployed people think like that. They are people who have been part of Australia, who have earned a living out of Australia and who have built assets out of Australia. But I suspect that, for most of them, that has long since gone. This Government has created one million unemployed. Unemployment has taken those people from where they used to be part of Australia's wealth to the position they are in now. I guess the only thing they have left of what was a great country is their flag. I guess that they, more than most, reel with horror when they see people like Senator Bolkus rejecting and trivialising the flag. The people who cannot get a job because of this Government's actions are strongly in favour of retaining our existing flag because it is their only connection with the great nation Australia used to be. It is interesting that those figures should come out. It is necessary that as many Australians as possible are made aware of the hypocrisy and the disgusting attitude with which people like Senator Bolkus treat our flag. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I propose that the following matter of public importance be submitted to the Senate for discussion today: namely, the strong endorsement by the OECD of the policies contained in the coalition's Fightback package of economic reforms. I say at the outset that that package is specifically designed to cut taxes, create jobs and provide incentive and opportunity for growth in the Australian economy, which is still experiencing the most severe recession for 60 years, a recession caused by the policy failures of this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not just an economic matter. The economic problems that we have today and the proposals contained in the coalition's Fightback package of reforms are much more than economic issues. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback! </EMPHASIS>is much more than an economic document; it is a very important social document. It is an important expression of political principles and it is about a new role for government in Australia. It is based on the essential proposition that the role of government must be to provide a stable framework of policy and law within which individuals, families, businesses and other community organisations can plan with confidence and have economic and other freedoms to choose the courses of action which best suit them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a very close relationship between economic freedom and vitality on the one hand and a moral and just society on the other. We can see that in our own society today. Our whole social fabric is under enormous strain from almost 40 per cent youth unemployment and from the desperation and despair of the huge numbers of people, particularly those in middle age, who have now been unemployed for upwards of a year and beyond. Economic freedom and growth do not in themselves guarantee a just, fair and moral community, but they certainly foster it and, for their full benefits to be achieved, they require it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time the greater freedom of economic choice does not achieve everything. There are limits to freer markets and they need a clear framework of rules within which to operate properly. Government must promote competition and ensure fair dealings between people. It must resolve conflicts and protect the weak against exploitation. They are the very principles which underline the proposals put forward by the coalition in its Fightback package. They are the very principles which are endorsed by the OECD in its latest economic survey of Australia released just last week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure Senator McMullan will claim&mdash;as have Government Ministers, the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and Minister for Finance (Mr Willis)&mdash;that the report was produced after the Government's so-called One Nation statement, its economic statement of 26 February, was prepared. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, released before. I acknowledge that and thank Senator McMullan. The point I want to make is that in the frontispiece to the OECD report it says that the final approval of the survey for publication was given by the Committee on 5 March 1992, after revisions in the light of discussions during the review. In the introductory pages there is a summation of some of the main aspects of the Government's 26 February economic statement. The report just lists them and gives no comment on them at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the OECD had really believed that the conditions, policies and proposals contained in the Government's 26 February One Nation statement&mdash;which really was a one job statement; a statement designed to try to shore up the position of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)&mdash;were significant, then it could have redone much of the analysis and certainly the conclusions contained in the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Did the Treasury slip up on this? The Federal Treasury has the opportunity to have a significant input into OECD reports on their own countries. Or did it secretly or privately agree with the criticism levelled by the OECD by implication at the Government's One Nation statement, and certainly the criticism that is levelled quite directly at the Government's economic policy performance? Did it secretly or privately agree with the reform proposals contained in the coalition's Fightback proposals? The comments contained in the OECD report provide a very strong endorsement of the coalition's Fightback proposals, while at the same time contain very strong criticism of the Government's policy performance; a policy performance which in no way is changed by the proposals in the economic statement of 26 February which, by now, has sunk absolutely and without trace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> First of all, let us have a look at some of the criticisms of the One Nation economic statement of 26 February contained, in effect, in the OECD report. The OECD report, although couched in moderate language and despite the fact, as I have said, of its having been prepared with the assistance of the Treasury, makes a joke of the economic statement of 26 February. It reveals beyond any doubt Mr Keating's failure to deliver micro-economic reform and highlights the macro-economic failures of this Government as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report points out that the forecast growth for Australia is much less than that contained in the Government's economic statement; that is, there is a large discrepancy between the growth forecast of 3 per cent contained in the OECD report and the forecast of almost 5 per cent&mdash;or 4 3/4 per cent&mdash;in the Government forecasts for the next year, 1992-93. As I said, although the OECD forecast was made before the economic statement was released, the stimulation contained in that statement is very insignificant relative to forecasts of growth. There are other reasons why, clearly, the Prime Minister's forecasts in that statement are rubbish and why the statement based upon them has no validity as a serious economic statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The OECD, in contrast to the Government's much vaunted views, sees the recent inflation gains slipping away with inflation reaching 4 per cent in 1993. That, of course, is a figure that would be above the OECD average.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The OECD has also criticised the Government in terms of its wages policy. It says that the wages policy did not deliver inflation performance comparable to that of Australia's trading partners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, despite and in stark contrast to all the parading that this Government has done over recent years about its economic policy approach and the improved competitive position that it proclaims Australia has experienced, the OECD report categorically and damningly shows that to be absolutely wrong. For example, the report says that our inflation record in the 1980s `did not improve to the same degree as in the large OECD countries and has only, over the past year, matched their record'. It continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most OECD countries adopted firm anti-inflationary monetary policies in the early 1980s and achieved substantial and sustained reductions in inflation. Australia was slower to come to grips with the legacy of the high inflation of the 1970s.</PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on to note the fall in inflation in the last year or so, but puts it down, quite correctly, to the enormous recession that we have had&mdash;the deepest recession in 60 years&mdash;and it expresses considerable doubt as to the Government's prospects of retaining inflation at a sustainably low level: certainly a level below that of our major trading partners. That, of course, along with productivity growth, is what will determine the future living standards of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it comes to the productivity record, the OECD is especially damning of Australia's performance. It says quite categorically that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Growth</EMPHASIS> in Australian labour and total factor productivity (TFP) has been slow. Between 1982/83&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, of course, when this Government came to office&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and 1990/91 hourly labour productivity for the whole economy grew at an annual rate of 0.7 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, in the five years to 1990-91:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . labour productivity on a comparable basis was approximately unchanged&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, no labour productivity growth at all in the five years to 1990-91. The report points out that the growth of productivity has slowed on whatever measure one wants to adopt for it. Productivity is a difficult thing to measure, but on all measures productivity growth in Australia has slowed. On a comparison between countries, the OECD says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . available data suggest that while productivity levels in the Australian agricultural and mining sector are substantially above the OECD average, those in other sectors are well below the OECD average.</PARA>
<PARA>It draws particular attention to the abysmally low productivity levels in government business enterprises which, it says `would appear to be roughly one-half the OECD average'. So, in relation to inflation and productivity&mdash;two key determinants of the future competitiveness of this country and, therefore, of our prospects of job creation and improved living standards&mdash;we have in this OECD report a damning indictment of the Australian experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also goes on, in effect, to criticise very strongly the Government's lack of performance in terms of privatisation. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Government has undertaken a limited privatisation program.</PARA>
<PARA>If one knows how the OECD bureaucrats go about drafting and framing their reports, one would know that that is in fact a strong criticism of the Government. The report goes on, in some detail, to underline and describe the poor performance of government business enterprises in Australia over recent years and, in effect, to criticise the Government for its failure to go further down the privatisation and corporatisation route. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, there is a major road block there as far as the Labor Government is concerned. The unions have said to the Government, `You're not going to get greater efficiency in government business enterprises by corporatising and privatising them; we are going to stop you from doing so'. They have put a stopper, therefore, on improved productivity growth in terms of what is arguably the major determinant of the underlying growth in productivity in Australia. So, again, we have there a damning indictment of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noted with interest and acclaim Senator Watson's notice of motion just prior to this debate. The OECD has strongly endorsed, by implication, the Opposition's proposals for a goods and services tax. It has criticised the existence of the wholesale sales tax in terms of its failure to be eliminated from the costs of doing business in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wholesale sales tax in Australia is a very significant impediment to business efficiency and competitiveness in Australia because it is built into our cost structure and there is no way in the world that it can be eliminated. That is one of the fundamental reasons why the coalition is proposing the abolition of the wholesale sales tax&mdash;an unfair, discriminatory, arbitrary tax that adds to the costs of business&mdash;and its replacement with a goods and services tax which, on any measure of fairness, equity and efficiency, is a vastly better tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The OECD report is strongly critical of the Government's policy performance and its actual growth performance. The OECD, through its call for the urgent speeding up of micro-economic reform, has endorsed very strongly indeed the whole thrust and many of the specific proposals of the coalition's Fightback package. The message in the OECD's report is very clear&mdash;it is said specifically that more vigorous micro-economic reform is urgently needed. The whole tenor of the OECD report is that not enough has been done in the area of micro-economic reform, not enough urgency is there. Therefore, Australia will continue to suffer on a competitive basis&mdash;a basis which determines our living standards&mdash;unless we take urgent measures to the contrary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is incredible that the now Prime Minister, when he was Treasurer addressing a foreign exchange conference in 1988, with his typical arrogance, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Frankly, we are at the point where there is nothing left to reform.</PARA>
<PARA>What an indictment of this now unelected Prime Minister's lack of understanding of the basic requirements of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the particular policies in the coalition's Fightback proposals which are underlined and underpinned in the OECD's report on Australia which was released last week. The major practical proposal to achieve the objectives that the OECD is telling us that we need to achieve if we are to create jobs, increase our economic growth and derive improved living standards for our people, is tax reform. The OECD report talks specifically about tax reform. The Fightback package contains a proposal for a major reduction in personal income tax at all income levels, particularly targeted at lower and middle income earners. There is a total reduction of $13 billion, almost 30 per cent of the existing personal income tax take in Australia. It is the largest reduction in our history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will reduce, by abolishing various taxes, some $20 billion of the tax cost of producing goods and services in Australia. It will do so particularly through the abolition of the wholesale sales tax; that dreadful tax on jobs, namely, payroll tax; and the fuel excise, which adds so much to the costs of transport and distribution in Australia. We will replace the wholesale sales tax with a value-added tax from 1 October 1994. A value-added tax, in the form of a goods and services tax, is an efficient tax, a fair tax and a tax which will help to create jobs and improve our competitiveness and productivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will also increase national savings through major changes in superannuation and in other ways. We will concentrate industry policy on making business more competitive and profitable by reducing business costs. We will embark on a major program of privatisation to improve the efficiency of public sector enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are the things that this country needs; they are the things that this Government stoically refuses to undertake; they are the essence of the Fightback proposals and the only way to reform and lead to better living standards for all Australians. </PARA>

There are a lot of profound analyses of the Australian economy going on, of which the OECD's may be regarded as one of the least significant. This report comes from a very important organisation, but that does not mean that a back-of-the-envelope assessment by a few people wandering through Australia for a few days is one of the most important assessments of our economy. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most significant question about the OECD report on Australia, notwithstanding that it was released recently, is: when was it done? It is based on a visit to Australia in September 1991 when the basic survey was undertaken, and a meeting at which that was reviewed in January 1992. Those are the two key periods. The visit to Australia on which this survey is based was in September 1991. It is true that the Australian economy was in recession in 1991.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The OECD is absolutely right when it says that the issue is about locking in the low inflation that we have achieved. To the December quarter our inflation rate of 1.5 per cent was the second lowest in the OECD. That is a significant achievement. We did not have that in September but we have it now. We have built on it. We want to sustain and maintain that low inflation because inflation is a very unfair mechanism which is eating away at the wealth and income of Australians. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The OECD's predictions on inflation are wrong because they are a bit out of date. Certainly on the basis of the circumstances that Australia is confronting now with, as I say, the second lowest inflation rate in the OECD, its predictions are a bit ungenerous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most important disagreement I had&mdash;I do not want to talk about this at length, but Senator Short gave it some emphasis so I will respond&mdash;involves the predictions about growth. We can all get too carried away with econometrics and say, `My model is bigger than yours', but let us look at factors that affect the likely outcome on economic growth in Australia which were not taken into account in this review, because that is a very important issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all, the predictions were pre-One Nation. There is a significant input to economic growth from One Nation. The prevailing assessment is that there is about half a per cent increase in economic growth in Australia from that. The view on which this document is based is September 1991. The December national quarter accounts have revised the GDP growth in the September quarter and have produced a significantly amended statistical base upon which the prospects for Australia for 1992 and 1993 should be based and assessed. Factoring those elements into the analysis would certainly have produced a stronger assessment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Equally important, since September 1991 the drought has broken, and there is nothing in the OECD assessment to take into account the significant benefit that will flow in economic growth to Australia and the very positive contribution to growth from the farm sector which is expected in 1992-93. The assessment is based on outdated data. It is pre-One Nation. The policy situation has changed. Those are the areas of the OECD's critique about which we disagree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at these so-called great endorsements of the Opposition. I do not want to talk all the time about One Nation and Fightback as they relate to the OECD; I want to talk more about the general analysis of the Australian economy and the relative prospects under the competing packages that are before the Australian people. It is said by implication in Senator Short's matter of public importance and in his remarks, although he did not say so explicitly, that the OECD recommends that Australia implement a GST, which it does not. It makes only a very passing reference to that issue. It concludes rightly that there is further room for improvement in tax reform. There have been significant changes in the tax system as it relates to business arising from One Nation, some of which have already passed through this Parliament, some of which are currently before it and some of which will be introduced this week and next. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, the proposal for the simplification of sales tax will be coming before the Parliament with a whole range of other important reforms. So there is no endorsement of GST in the document. It does not purport to do that and it does not do that. However, it does say that we need to continue to reform our tax system, and that is correct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Does the assessment recommend the adoption of explicit inflation targets and the granting of a greater independence to the central bank? I have to say that I would not care if it did because I would not agree with such a recommendation. That is a fundamentally anti-democratic proposal. The assessment does not recommend that we adopt an inflation target, nor does it suggest there is a need to grant the Reserve Bank of Australia greater independence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The document spends a lot of time talking about the credibility of one's credentials on an anti-inflation front. The credibility of Australian monetary authorities has been enhanced by their achievement of low inflation rates and, more importantly, the fall in inflationary expectations. These things will enhance significantly the prospects for Australians with regard to interest rates and other matters in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then turn to what the report has said about micro-economic reform. Senator Short&mdash;I am sure it was because of time&mdash;did not make reference to the very favourable comments the survey makes about Australia's micro-economic reform program, including in particular recent progress with labour market reform. It says that there is more to do, and there is. Significantly, it could not possibly refer to the significant micro-economic reforms proposed in One Nation in the areas of domestic transport, electricity and education. Those reforms are all important and will flow from the Government's initiatives in One Nation. So the survey does not endorse a GST and the Opposition's policy with regard to the Reserve Bank or micro-economic reform. It calls on us to do better; we should and need to do better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The OECD survey was a little more fairly dealt with by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>&mdash;I do not want to take too long on this&mdash;in an article headed, `Praise&mdash;and a prod&mdash;from OECD'. That gets the balance more accurately. Basically, it praises what we have done, but it also says that we need to do more. Anybody who doubts that the Government needs to do more should look at the policies outlined in the One Nation package, which policies are the next stage of doing more about reforming our economy. The editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is the OECD&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">still struck a more optimistic tone than previous surveys about inflation, trade and controlling the foreign debt level&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a timely reminder that, while some progress has been made on getting it right, the rest of the world has not been standing still.</PARA>
<PARA>There are a number of other <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> assessments indicating the progress that has been made but suggesting correctly that there is more to do. If I get time, I will come back to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not surprising that we find here today an Opposition desperate for somebody to be seen to agree with its Fightback package because, increasingly, the Australian people do not. The Australian people are looking at the goods and services tax and saying, `We do not like this proposal for it is fundamentally unfair and it is fundamentally inflationary'. Industries are saying more and more that they do not like this policy proposal. For example, a member of the restaurant industry in Queensland has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe the effects of GST are going to be diabolical. In countries where GST has been introduced, the restaurant industry has been the most affected.</PARA>
<PARA>Further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We're so terrified about GST that on the national level we have engaged accounting firm Ernst and Young to put together a thesis on the effect of GST.</PARA>
<PARA>The restaurant industry has seen right through the Opposition. It is saying, `We want you to reintroduce business entertainment as a tax deduction'. I will be very interested to see the Opposition's response to that, because I think that that is what it will come back to. The Opposition will return to some of those other unfair proposals to reinforce the inequity of the GST. The fact of the matter is that the restaurant industry has seen through the Opposition, as the Australian people increasingly are doing, in this unfair and inflationary proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not have time today to talk about the fun that the Opposition has been having with the tariff aspects of its Fightback package. However, I want to turn to the proposal for the major expenditure cuts, which I think is the most unfair aspect of Fightback. That is where the inequity is compounded. It is the most serious shortcoming altogether of the proposal. The evidence makes it clear that the most fundamental redistributive thing which governments can do is in the manner in which they spend money rather than raise it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The GST and the associated tax changes to income tax and other taxes will make the way in which government raises revenue in Australia less fair. It is more important that the way in which the cuts are proposed will make the way in which we spend money less fair. In particular, the cuts will be affecting most adversely in Australia and internationally those least able to cope with that extra burden, be it the absolutely reprehensible proposal to cut overseas aid&mdash;$100m will be taken from the poorest people in the poorest countries&mdash;the welfare proposals, the health policy or the other areas of cuts in the document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, I want to talk about the jobs impact. When $10 billion is cut from government spending there is an adverse regressive effect not only in the redistribution of wealth in this country but also quite clearly in the cost of jobs. We only have to look at where the savings are proposed to realise that, directly and indirectly, this package will have a very unfair effect on jobs. It will create fewer jobs. It is exactly the wrong proposal for Australia as it emerges from a recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also significant and legitimate concerns about Fightback and its impact on the environment. It removes the capacity of the tax system to discriminate in favour of environmentally beneficial goods, whether they be solar panels or recycled paper or goods for insulation. At the moment the tax system can give benefits and discriminate in favour of environmentally beneficial goods: that disappears under the proposals of Fightback. We all know the adverse environmental impact of the proposals with regard to petrol prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some who argue, on both sides of the chamber, that the biggest distinction between the Government and the Opposition with regard to One Nation and Fightback and the context in which they are being developed is in the area of industrial relations. That is a very major area of distinction, although it is not my view that it is the most important area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Fightback policies there would be a return to the bad old days of conflict. It certainly reinforces the argument that those in the weakest position will have the protection removed. It weakens the weakest. The consequence of the whole philosophical thrust of Fightback&mdash;and I am not saying it is intentional; I am not saying that people are evil or terrible&mdash;is that those in the greatest need will be those who suffer the most. It is a return to the fairly orthodox conservative formulas. It is about fighting unemployment by putting people out of work, fighting inflation by increasing prices, and increasing living standards by reducing real wages. That is why the Fightback package is in trouble. That is why the Opposition is running around the world looking for some people who might look even a little bit like they agree with some part of it. As I say, the Opposition is running around like a puppy looking for a pat at a party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing Senator Short said with which I do agree is that this debate is about more than economics. The competing economic packages being put before the people of Australia are about fundamental values. They do reflect different values about society and the role of government in society. I think that is a good thing; it is a matter for major debate on another day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing that distinguishes this approach is this over-obsession with the phrase `freedom of choice'. Freedom of choice is of itself a good thing and no-one should criticise it, but the problem with freedom of choice when it has no context is that it can easily become the freedom for the already powerful to take advantage of their already privileged position to disadvantage those who might otherwise be being assisted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been said by others, and remains true, that it is as unfair to treat unequals equally as it is to treat equals unequally, and that is the problem with Fightback. By pretending that all people&mdash;whether people in the labour market, people in the welfare area or people overseas in need of assistance&mdash;are equally in a position to be able to protect and advance their interests, that the poorest and the wealthiest, the weakest and the strongest, are equally able to cope, is a recipe for inequity. It is no wonder that the Opposition is clutching at these flimsy straws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The OECD document is more accurately described as a timely reminder of the need to maintain the momentum of change and reform which the Government has introduced. I do not feel the document is as important as many other people seem to think it is. Nevertheless, to the extent that it is a contribution to our economic debate, we welcome it. But we totally disagree with the rather tenuous analysis that Senator Short tried to introduce today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter before us today arises because of the recently published annual OECD economic survey of Australia. The Opposition has found some solace in the OECD report in that it claims that the report supports its policies. Hence we are debating this matter of public importance this afternoon. The specific words of the coalition's proposition read:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The strong endorsement by the OECD of the policies contained in the Coalition's Fightback! package of economic reforms.</PARA>
<PARA>We need to look at exactly what the OECD did say in its report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report states that more vigorous micro-economic reform is urgently needed. While not wishing to defend this particular Government more than any other, I still think it is fair to point out that no other postwar Federal government has tackled many of the areas described in micro-economic reform at all, and obviously that has been to our detriment. But our uncompetitive ports, shipping, rail and other transport areas are being reformed. It is very easy to say, `We would do it more quickly', but that approach involves imposing settlements which may lead to strikes and other disruptions, because such an approach may impose very high costs on industries and even slow down reform in some of these areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition says that it will slash transport costs; it will slash goods handling costs; and it will slash shipping costs. But all these solutions involve large-scale sackings, and we can see that this is mooted to be happening and to some extent has begun in the case of AOTC. In that case the Government has insisted on corporatisation; it has argued that this will make this part of the public sector more efficient. So we go ahead, we introduce a competitor on a very tilted playing field, and the first efficiency outcome mooted is the shedding of 20,000 jobs to add to the existing one million unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So much for the Government's commitment to the AOTC industry plan, a commitment to which the Government was dragged with some considerable reluctance by the Australian Democrats, and a commitment on which it looks to be reneging already. So-called efficiencies must be managed so as to minimise human impact, especially in rural areas. So-called efficiencies must be accepted by the work force, or they will be counterproductive in the long run. Industrial organisations will not accept unfair and provocative tactics and will understandably resist. The result will be that all Australians will lose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any event, the Opposition's position is considerably weakened because it is at this time supporting the Government's tariff reductions, even though these supposedly vital micro-economic reforms have not yet been completed. The Democrats believe that orderly and universally accepted change is infinitely preferable to confrontation. It is very easy to publish a document saying, `We will do things more quickly', but it is a completely different matter to try to implement change in the real world. There is more to life, as the general public is saying, than computer models. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All economic reform involves changing people's lives. People have a right to be a part of the process of change and they have a right to have an opportunity to input into the process of change. But they do not have the right to control that change. For example, it is easy to campaign that Australia should remove cabotage, but what would that mean in real life? Bear in mind that most, if not all, countries in the OECD retain cabotage for their coastlines. It would mean the virtual destruction of local shipping industry. How can we compete against exploitative wages and conditions? The answer is that we cannot, and more unemployment is not a sensible policy for us to pursue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we do not accept the assertions in Fightback about micro-economic reforms being deliverable or being necessarily desirable anyway. This OECD report does not back up the Opposition in this area, although it does tell this particular Government to get a move on. Predictably, the Government, through its Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), has said that the report is out of date in this area because the Government has announced some transport initiatives in the One Nation statement. There is more than a grain of truth in that defence as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The OECD has said that there needs to be a more decentralised industrial relations system. Fightback proposals are still a little bit unclear in this area. On the one hand, we have Mr Howard saying that there will be a purely voluntary system of enterprise bargaining in which employees and employers can choose to opt out of the award system, subject to some basic minimum terms and conditions, and they can go on to make their own arrangements. On the face of it, that simply provides that workers can alter their situation if they so choose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, however, we also have Dr Hewson flitting over to New Zealand and floating the adoption of the New Zealand model. This is a completely different proposition from Mr Howard's. It involves the automatic termination of all awards and the substitution of individual contracts. While most people would not have much difficulty with being paid on the basis of how hard they work, the usual New Zealand experience has been that people have been presented with an ultimatum&mdash;`Work for less than you used to or you don't work at all'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats support a fair system of wages. The point about wage decentralisation is that it affects people's standard of living. People have commitments, such as mortgages and education expenses, just to name a couple. There must be some protection of the weak, as some speakers have already said, if we are to call ourselves a civilised society. As such, the Democrats support the continuation of the Industrial Relations Commission with appropriate powers to ensure that working conditions and wages are fair. The New Zealand model is not a fair system and it is not found anywhere else in OECD countries. There is no endorsement in this OECD report for a totally unregulated labour market. So much for the OECD's endorsement of Fightback policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major matter from which the Opposition has drawn hope is the supposed endorsement of the Opposition's goods and services tax proposal. Firstly, I concur with Senator McMullan that there is no clear recommendation in this report that Australia needs a GST. There is a recognition that the existing wholesale sales tax imposes a 2 per cent increase on business inputs. This can simply be changed by continuing to widen the inputs currently exempted from the tax. Also, the report does not consider the costs that a GST would impose, especially the compliance costs, which fall so disproportionately on the small business sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the weekend Mr Kelty announced ACTU policy, which confirmed that unions would seek a pay rise to offset the inflationary aspect of the GST. This would compound the inflation effect of the introduction of a GST.  It would massively increase the inflation rate and probably lead to widespread industrial action, which would impose further costs on all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the great efficiency that this GST would deliver? It would increase the price of basic food and clothing items and would impact most heavily on families and those on low incomes. As I said before&mdash;I have said this often&mdash;there is more to life than economic efficiency. There are basic social justice issues, such as the quality of life, which are never factored into the models of such shock-troop of government as the Industry Commission. The imposition of a GST is vigorously opposed by the Democrats. It is not supported by this OECD report, despite the remarks of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The OECD report also touches upon the question of tariffs. This is where the academic nature of the report is fully borne out. The basic rationale is that all tariff protection is bad and it should be eliminated as quickly as possible. This statement is made in the same report which makes the appalling prediction that unemployment will stay above 10 per cent for the next two years. Faster tariff reductions, especially given the chaos in the major engines of the world economy&mdash;that is, financial in Japan, social in the United States, and social and industrial in Germany&mdash;will inevitably result in higher unemployment in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The doctrinaire approach of the Opposition on tariffs is very similar to that of the Government. It is just that to this point in time the Government has done a pretty good job of fooling some sections of the media and the community that there is a big difference between Labor and the coalition in this area. The voters in Wills, who are the casualties of this kind of policy, have said, `A pox on both your houses'. It is interesting to note that Hugh Mackay's latest research report confirms that this view is widely held in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to step out of the academic analysis, which is so fashionable, and look at the views of some of the industrialists who also have to operate in the economic experiment which the economists tell us is good for them. For example, Carol Austin, the director of public affairs for BHP, is quoted in this week's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin </EMPHASIS>as arguing that we should have reformed our inefficient sectors first and then reduced protection so that we could join the international marketplace with some sort of chance. What ordinary commonsense logic!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw an analogy with sport. We do not just send our promising athletes to the Olympics in the hope that they win. We select the most promising young performers, give them the best assistance, the best coaches, and the best facilities; and we nurture their development. This is how we should treat industry. The Government has unilaterally cut tariffs without giving our industries and their work forces a fair go. The country of Chile is cited by Ms Austin as an example of reform before tariff reductions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at what another industrialist, Mr Peter Cottrell, managing director of Email, has to say about the Government's tariff reduction in the same <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> article. I choose this example because today we heard a lengthy contribution from the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) about how Email has been a model firm under the international best practice policy of the Government. Mr Cottrell says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . one logical impact of tariff reductions is for manufacturers to become importers. This is what Email has already done, reducing the number of appliances made in Australia, closing factories and importing brands such as Electrolux and Frigidaire. As the recession has tightened over the past few years, Email has laid off more than 3,000 workers&mdash;and lower tariffs are among the reasons.</PARA>
<PARA>Causing unemployment is wonderful best practice policy! Reducing tariffs costs jobs in the short term. We must ask: why can we not wait until the economy has picked up and employment is growing again?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition claims that its policy is to achieve these cost savings and efficiencies before reducing tariffs. But in the meantime, it voted in favour of an acceleration of the phase-out of the tariff on sugar. As I have said, the Democrats do not support all of these so-called efficiencies, especially when they are regressive in their impact on the community. But at least there is beginning to be an acknowledgment in the general populace that Australian business must not be sacrificed to unfair competition. In that context, I question the big picture of why the Opposition supports the Government's tariff reductions when the economies it says are necessary have not yet been achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thus, for all of the reasons stated already, the Democrats do not support this matter of public importance because the OECD report did not strongly endorse the Fightback package and because more deregulation, more privatisation, the total abolition of industry assistance, plus a much harsher social security system and an unfair industrial relations system, are not a recipe for success but are, rather, a recipe for economic and social stagnation, as has occurred during the previous five years in New Zealand. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite frankly, the size of our debt and our inability to deal with it can be compared with an ordinary householder who gets problems with the mortgage, Bankcard and other debts and is simply not earning enough to meet the monthly payments. This country is in the same situation. We have run up an international debt simply because we have not saved enough to provide capital for investment in our own country, and we have had to go overseas and borrow other people's savings. We have to repay those savings, but we are now in a situation where we are not earning enough to make those repayments. No matter how good our import-export figures are, those interest payments put us further into debt every month&mdash;somewhere between $14 billion and $20 billion a year. That debt has to be stabilised. </PARA>

That happens, and the standard of living goes down again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government seems to have no wish, vision or anything else for a policy that will counteract that, but the Fightback package of the coalition has. The Fightback package has as its central theme the need for tax reform, and it has as its central theme the need for tax reform for all the reasons that the OECD report highlights. Very simply, we have to move away from a reliance on direct taxation where annually, of the $90 billion we collect by way of taxation revenue, $50 billion comes out of individual taxpayers' pockets&mdash;$41 billion by way of PAYE payments, and the remainder by way of provisional tax payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In reforming this situation we will abolish seven taxes&mdash;seven taxes which impact upon the cost of doing business. We will remove $20 billion from the cost of doing business. One of the taxes we will remove is the wholesale sales tax&mdash;the tax that presently collects somewhere between $9 billion and $10 billion a year, and the effect of which is built into the cost of every transaction in this country. Even the emotional necessities of life have a component of that wholesale sales tax in them&mdash;be it by way of printing or the production of a carton. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then, of course, there is the petroleum excise which dramatically affects the cost of business in this country, which was described as a country suffering from the tyranny of distance. What do we do? We have a Government which, during its life, has increased the tax on petroleum&mdash;26c per litre. The cost of delivering a product even a short distance from the place of manufacture through the wholesaling system into the retailing system, is subject to that tax as well as that wicked tax on jobs, payroll tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are three important taxes which are to be abolished, together with tariff tax, compulsory superannuation&mdash;which is another form of payroll tax&mdash;and the training levy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The OECD report notes how the impact of the wholesale sales tax is detrimental to the cost of doing business. It talks about a goods and services tax. That was rejected by the trade union movement in 1985 when Bill Kelty&mdash;who was having another spray at it in the weekend press&mdash;in the dead of night crept into a motel down the road and told Bob Hawke that it was not on.

Quite frankly, that would encroach upon the power of the trade unions. The Labor Party is nothing but the political wing of the trade union movement. We hear it all the time from Senator Cook, when he speaks as a good trade unionist rather than as a Minister of the Crown. We know that the ALP will not cannibalise itself and destroy the power base of the trade union movement.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The OECD report highlights the fact that the privatisation of government assets has not been done to anywhere near the extent that it can be done. It is essential that contracting out, and the other practices advocated in the Fightback package, are implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has combined the worst of all possible worlds. With its corporatisation policy it has pushed what have been government activities off budget and away from the proper scrutiny of the Parliament. The result is that millions of dollars have been dealt with by these so-called GBEs which are not subject to parliamentary scrutiny, unless we have the grace and favour appearance of those agencies before Estimates and other hearings. The OECD singles out Telecom as perhaps&mdash;and I use the term facetiously&mdash;the star attraction; that is, as the GBE which has had the least productivity gain of any government activity in Australia during the life of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The OECD report also states that we need swifter tariff reform for the highly protected industries such as the automotive industry&mdash;the passenger motor vehicle industry&mdash;and the textile, clothing and footwear industry. It is interesting to note where we still have those very high levels of taxation; it is tariff tax. All that so-called protection means&mdash;and I have abolished that word from my lexicon&mdash;is the imposition of a tax on one group of people with the benefit accruing to another group of people because policy says that that group of people is special and the rest are not special at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consider a struggling family, or a single mother on a pension trying to cope with feeding and clothing her offspring. What happens to her when she goes into K-mart to buy an inexpensive item of clothing for her small daughter? What happens to the price of that garment? The imposition of the tariff tax on an imported garment, which would enable a mother to dress her child with pride&mdash;and the same applies to shoes&mdash;has an effective consumption tax component in excess of 25 per cent. In other words, tariff tax penalises the people at the lowest end of the economic scale, the people most in need of access to cheaper goods. The reduction of tariff tax and swifter reform in that regard is highlighted by the OECD report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the direction of monetary policy, the report highlights the need to maintain low inflation. It notes that this direction must be pursued with a medium term focus by a central bank afforded greater independence. Each of the points that the OECD report makes is reflected in our Fightback package. The report highlights the desperate need for labour market reform. That means the undoing of all those deals done at the time of Federation, when Victoria and New South Wales said that they would bear the financial brunt of paying the mendicant States in return for Federation. But Victoria in return said, `We'll do that but we have to have protectionism and a centralised wage fixing system'. </PARA>

The Commission has been attacked viciously by the people who purport to claim that it is somehow independent and an arbiter. It is not. It has been undermined and demeaned by the people who say that it is necessary. Our policy is a much more honest and straightforward one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other remarks that need to be made about this report are these: here is an OECD report which supports the policies that we have outlined and yet it is based on briefings given by the Government's own department&mdash;Treasury. The difference between the conclusions to which the Government came in its One Nation statement and those to which the OECD came is that presumably the officers who briefed the OECD from September through to January were people who were not politicised and were not drawing politicised conclusions but were simply feeding in the raw data to be interpreted by others in an impartial way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we had the Estimates hearings on several occasions we asked Treasury representatives about the special micro-economic model that they built to test the coalition's Fightback package. We asked them whether they tested the One Nation package, or the `No Nation' package as it is more aptly called. They refused to answer.

I am sorry that Senator McMullan is not here. But it does indeed matter, because we have seen the Treasury supply figures to the OECD, we have seen an impartial analysis of those figures and we have seen the resultant report which backs up the Fightback package and the policies outlined in our 20-point plan which, quite frankly, will abolish seven taxes, bring about true micro-economic reform, replace the wholesale sales tax with a goods and services tax, increase pensions and lower income tax&mdash;truly a policy for recovery. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer to a number of comments made in the previous contribution by Senator Bishop. She said that the OECD report was based on Government briefings. That is partly correct, but she is guilty of an untruth in that she left out reference to the other organisations that the OECD receives briefings from. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The OECD does not talk just to the Government. It talks to State governments, business organisations and the trade union movement. The OECD takes into account a range of views. Its report is not based, even substantially, on the input provided by the Federal Government. So Senator Bishop should be a lot more honest in her analysis of the briefings given as input to this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other areas of great untruth in her speech involve the continual assertion that the Opposition is about abolishing seven taxes. One of the taxes she referred to, the coal levy, has already been abolished by this Government. So we are down to six taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition refers to the abolition of the education and training guarantee levy. In fact, a substantial number of businesses in this country were spending on education and training an amount in excess of the levy. If the levy is abolished, it is highly unlikely that that will have any effect whatsoever on business costs. So, again, it is an abolition in name rather than in fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition speaks about abolishing a superannuation tax. This must be the greatest area of hypocrisy that I have heard from the Opposition. First of all, Senator Bishop confused the superannuation guarantee levy with the taxes on superannuation. If she reads the Opposition's Fightback package&mdash;and obviously she has not&mdash;she will find that the Opposition is pledged to maintain the superannuation guarantee levy at its existing level, should the Opposition get into government. That is hardly likely, but if the Opposition does get into government the superannuation guarantee levy, if it is passed, will stand at 5 per cent. So there is no pledge by the Opposition to remove the superannuation guarantee levy. Senator Bishop is confusing the superannuation guarantee levy with the Opposition's proposed reduction, in some areas, of taxation on superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, Senator Bishop has not read the Opposition policy because the Opposition makes the point that it will increase some of the taxes on superannuation. The Opposition will increase the tax on superannuation investment income from 15 per cent to 25 per cent. In fact, there is no net reduction in superannuation taxes in the coalition package. So that is strike three&mdash;a third tax measure that is of absolutely no benefit whatsoever to business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then have the example of payroll tax. Payroll tax does not apply to the majority of businesses in this country. So that is strike four. We will give Senator Bishop half a point; payroll tax does apply to big business in this country, but it does not apply to small business. So we have three and a half taxes that do not apply to business in this country. So the position put by those opposite, particularly Senator Bishop, on the abolition of so-called taxes and levies is a half-truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, in the other breath, Senator Bishop draws our attention to the balance of payments. The Opposition refuses to recognise the effect that a reduction in the petrol tax would have on the balance of payments. This is at worst petrol pump populism by those opposite, pandering to the National Party and its constituency. A reduction in petrol taxes would lead to a very significant increase in demand and an increase in the import of petroleum or oil into this country. That would have a devastating effect on the balance of payments. So one can have it both ways when in opposition&mdash;one certainly cannot have it both ways in government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have to commend the speech that was made by Senator Kernot. Whilst I do not agree with some of the remarks that she made, I think the overall balance of her speech was very good. Senator Kernot referred to tariff reductions that occurred after restructuring in Chile. I would point out that a brutal military regime carried out that restructuring, with devastating social consequences. There was a dramatic widening of the poverty and wealth gap in that nation. Some economists might like to allude to this as the way that we should go. Certainly, the fallout from that experimentation has been quite devastating. I think we can point to similar social consequences in the United States and the United Kingdom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the OECD report which purportedly supports the Opposition's Fightback policy. The OECD report is relevant in this debate in terms of its comments about inflation, micro-economic reform, the goods and services tax, labour market reform, education and training, and tariffs. The survey contains some statements that the Government believes are overdrawn. As I have said, the survey is based on a variety of views and inputs in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government does not agree with all the survey. We do not accept all of its views. But there is much in the survey that we can agree with. There is nothing unusual in that&mdash;it is all part of the healthy economic debate that is taking place in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The claims by the OECD in relation to inflation clearly have to be rejected. The OECD would prefer a more independent watch on our inflation rate through the Reserve Bank of Australia. Of course, the Opposition has made great play of the fact that it intends to allow the central bank to have greater independence. I would argue that it is results that count. We have an inflation rate that is almost the lowest amongst OECD countries. The nil inflation rate that we have at the present time is something that we can be proud of and boast about. This very commendable result was not achieved by an independent central bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would reject the approach that the Opposition originally announced of having an explicit inflation target of zero. I notice that the Opposition backtracked on that last week. The Opposition shadow Treasurer, Mr Reith, in fact did concede that there were circumstances in which a zero inflation rate was inappropriate. So the current inflation rate stands to the credit of this country and this Government. The likelihood of the inflation rate remaining low for a significant period is certainly very high. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would reject any criticism or suggestion by the OECD that we need to change our approach to inflation. The OECD did not adopt explicit inflation targets. It did not recommend that Australia should adopt an inflation target in any way. The survey did note that New Zealand and Canada had chosen to address their inflation levels by adopting an explicit intermediary inflation target. This is, to some extent, totally contradictory to adopting a policy of a GST which, of course, would increase inflation. I will get to the comments about the GST shortly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">OECD observes that there has been much significant progress in the last decade in the area of micro-economic reform. Our Government is the government that has implemented reform in the micro-economic area. The Opposition did nothing when in government. Its record was a flat zero. Of course, the OECD report was put together prior to the release of the One Nation package. There is explicit reference in the One Nation package to reforms in the areas of transport, electricity and education&mdash;the three areas in which there was some criticism by the OECD. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of transport, the Government announced that it would be placing higher priority on rail, highway and competitive ports. It announced that the Brisbane-Sydney-Melbourne rail line would be modernised and upgraded; that a standard gauge spur would be built to the Port of Brisbane; that a new rail-sea-road terminus would be constructed at Dynon in Melbourne; and that the rail facilities at the ports of Fremantle and Adelaide would be upgraded. It also announced that an extra $600m would be spent on road construction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of aviation, where there has been a revolution in the last decade, the Government has announced policies that will allow Qantas to carry domestic passengers. The Government expects that Australian and Ansett will be operating across the Tasman by 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of power generation&mdash;and, frankly, this is a State, not a Federal, government responsibility&mdash;the Government has facilitated greater cooperation towards a national power grid by offering $100m to upgrade the transmission link between New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. So there is positive reform in the micro-economic area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not correct to say that the OECD report embraces a GST. It makes a passing reference to the issue of GST. It concludes that, as regards tax reform, there is further room for improvement. A number of issues are being addressed by this Government and the simplification of sales tax is occurring. The report concludes that it may be beneficial for the economy in the long run. Of course, embracing the introduction of a GST is at odds with a low inflation policy. There would be a very significant increase in inflation if we embraced a GST tax. This is aside from the fact that this Government rejects such a tax because it would be socially inequitable and unfair to 70 per cent of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The OECD report is somewhat contradictory in the area of labour market reform. It supports the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in the move away from centralised wage fixing in favour of decentralised enterprise bargaining. This stands in contrast to the approach of those opposite who want individual bargaining, which would strip away the independence of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. It would also lead to the removal of such entitlements as annual leave, sick leave, long service leave and superannuation. That is what the Opposition policy means. The OECD is not endorsing that. The survey is somewhat contradictory in that it notes the Commission's decision to put in place a number of checks to limit wage flow-ons.

What Senator Sherry has forgotten is that every small business pays payroll tax when it buys goods and services from those big businesses which do have to pay payroll tax, because the cost of that payroll tax is added into the cost of the goods and services which those big businesses produce and which are often bought by small businesses for use in the products which they in turn produce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Sherry also claimed that the abolition of fuel excise, another very important part of the Fightback package, would have a devastating effect on our balance of payments because it would increase demand. He completely ignores the fact that the efficiencies and incentives which Fightback will offer to business will encourage greater oil exploration and greater discovery of oil in Australia. But, more importantly, it will not encourage significantly increased demand for oil products. What it will do is reduce the cost of goods and services in Australia because, with the enormous size of Australia and our relatively small population, the cost of transport makes up a much higher proportion of the cost of goods and services than it does in many other countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is absolute nonsense to retain an impost on fuel which adds to that cost of transport.

The embarrassed and shameful attempts of the present Treasurer to shrug off some of the OECD's unpalatable findings and attacks on the Government's economic policies in its recent biannual report on the state of the Australian economy are as pathetic as the media release he put out last Friday when he claimed that the OECD's growth and employment projections were both dated and clearly understated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer claimed that the report did not take into account the boost to activity coming from the Government's 26 February One Nation statement. So what? In the two months since that statement there has not been any evidence at all that One Nation is providing any boost to activity or employment. In fact, since February we have seen unemployment hit the staggering 11 per cent mark. That is 11 per cent of working Australians now out of work&mdash;unable to find a job of any kind. Is this the mark of the Government's success? Is this the record that it wants us to look at? Is this, in fact, the basis on which the Treasurer would claim that the OECD report is out of date?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Union activity still manages to halt production and hold up productivity. Industries are moribund and failing and bankruptcies have become commonplace in many quarters. The fiscal stimulation in One Nation just does not account for the differences between the OECD and the Government's growth estimates. Even Professor Ross Garnaut highlights that the One Nation statement increases the risk in the medium term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Garnaut clearly disagrees with the Treasurer and the Government. On last Friday's ABC <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS> program, he reinforced the findings of the OECD report. His conclusions were that it was very far reaching and confronted many of the issues facing Australia; one of which was the importance of accelerating this country's flagging structural or so-called micro-economic reform. He did not discount the report as irrelevant simply because it was prepared prior to the release of the Government's One Nation statement. He did not advise us that the effects of the drought were not countered. He said that we had made some progress but we had not made enough. In fact, we have not made nearly enough progress in the important areas of reform that are required. He said that we were not moving fast enough and that the OECD report was correct in underlining and focusing on these issues. So, quite apart from the OECD, Professor Garnaut has raised the concern that we in the Opposition have now held for a long time: that Australia is not moving fast enough to address the areas of growth in export industries and that faster progress on transport and communications efficiency must be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The OECD's message is distinct and lucid. For all the claptrap from the Government about its claims of micro-economic reform and improved industry efficiencies, Australia is still way behind the most efficient industrialised economies. Of course, if we continue our reform at this laggardly pace, they will jump farther and farther ahead because they are not standing still. Other countries are continuing their reform process and unless we catch up to their pace of reform, we simply fall farther behind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After a decade of Labor Government, we need look only at where we now find ourselves. Australia now ranks in the bottom third of the OECD list of living standards, having fallen from near the top. It is this Government that has put us there by its misguided and wayward attempts at economic management. Not only has the OECD caustically criticised Australia's productivity record and questioned whether it will improve, unless structural reform is pursued more vigorously, but by the release of its report it has lent the great weight of its support to a goods and services tax, which is an essential part of the Opposition's Fightback program, as being better for business than the Government's present wholesale sales tax regime. The OECD confirms what the Liberal and National parties have argued for a long time, which is that a goods and services tax will remove the tax burden on business inputs which the Government's present sales tax maintains. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The OECD has said that monetary policy has been primarily responsible for getting inflation down in Australia, whereas the Prime Minister claims that this is nonsense. He says that zero inflation came about because of the Government's incomes policy. He says that the Government alone can claim that it was able to break the back of Australia's inflation. As I said earlier, we all know that in fact it was this Government's monetary policy and its enormously high interest rates which destroyed so many businesses and jobs and which have resulted in inflation being as low as it now is. For the Government arrogantly to argue otherwise simply reinforces what the Opposition has known for a long time, and that is that the time for this Government is running out and that its days are numbered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The OECD report has rightly cast competent doubt over the One Nation statement and rightly attacked the Keating Government's economic policies. As a consequence, Treasurer Dawkins is bleating that it was not done the right way. The OECD has forecast higher unemployment, lower growth and higher inflation than is claimed will happen under the Government's One Nation statement. It clearly indicates that Australia must accelerate all of its reform process if we are to boost productivity sufficiently. It further points out that Australia is likely to lag considerably in the ensuing economic upturn because of high business debt and a surplus of commercial property. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the goods and services tax the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Simplifications of sales taxes, while not necessarily a priority issue, may be beneficial for the economy in the longer term.</PARA>
<PARA>If Australians want rapid economic growth, more jobs and higher real wages&mdash;and there is certainly no doubt among all the people whom I speak to in the community that they do&mdash;we must press on with the reform process at a much more rapid rate than this Government offers, including tariff cuts, regardless of what is happening in other countries. That is the essence of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> and there is no question that the policies contained in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> will achieve all this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The OECD report endorses a number of the coalition's proposals contained in the Fightback package, including the full privatisation of Government-owned enterprises and a greater reduction in tariffs in the highly protected industries, such as car manufacturing and clothing, textiles and footwear, in association with those structural reform measures which will reduce the costs of production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The OECD also supports the coalition's proposals to reform our ports and open up coastal shipping and trans-Tasman shipping to foreign competition. Most importantly, the OECD report supports the replacement of our centralised wage system and industrial awards with enterprise bargaining, including a single national minimum wage as has occurred in New Zealand. It endorses our notion that monetary policy should be directed towards achieving low inflation. With regard to wages the report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The less responsive are wage increases to higher unemployment, the more prolonged will be high unemployment following a tightening of monetary policy.</PARA>

Having enjoyed an early honeymoon, while we in the Government were a little preoccupied, the package has come under increasing criticism. It is now well and truly upstaged by One Nation, which I believe has caught the mood of the electorate in a way that Fightback has not. It has made Fightback yesterday's plan and One Nation tomorrow's plan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can understand why the Opposition is now grasping at straws, but the fact is that the Opposition can take no succour from the OECD report. First, the report was written before the One Nation statement, as other speakers have indicated, so that many of the conclusions and predictions need revision. This aside, the report by no means is an endorsement of the Opposition's proposals, as is claimed by the Opposition, any more than it is a critique of Government policies. It is an objective analysis of Australia's current position and where the OECD sees us going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an objective assessment, it will have people arguing for and against it. It represents the views of a group of economists, and no group of economists will ever attract a consensus of views. However, it does focus attention on the fact that the Government has achieved a level of inflation which is not only lower than that of our trading partners, but is historically low. I quote from page 9 of the OECD report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Importantly, inflation expectations have also fallen substantially, indeed to historically low levels, unlike the experience of the previous recession.</PARA>
<PARA>And at page 34:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whereas inflation has always fallen in past recessions, the marked reduction in inflation expectations is unique in this downturn.</PARA>
<PARA>And again at pages 48 and 49:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite the strong rise in demand in the late 1980s, inflation did not increase, principally reflecting the operation of the Accord and exchange rate appreciation. . . .Inflation across a range of measures has now fallen below the OECD average, to levels not seen for a generation;. . . </PARA>
<PARA>The OECD is then keen to draw attention to the fact that we have achieved very low inflation, that that inflation is lower than our trading partners but that, in addition, it is historically low for Australia. The report also makes the point that it is very important to lock in this lower rate of inflation and that this should be our prime consideration. The report states on page 88:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The challenge to the authorities in the 1990s is to match their excellent record in debt reduction, tariff and agricultural reforms in the 1980s by locking in low inflation and by further advancing structural reform.</PARA>
<PARA>I might add that that quotation hardly sounds like a criticism of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By implication, however, it is critical of the Opposition's package which includes in-built inflation. On its own estimates of 4.7 per cent&mdash;although I think this a fairly optimistic estimate&mdash;it seems to take the view that nobody will raise prices when costs have increased. On our estimate&mdash;including some other assumptions, such as the inclusion of road user charges&mdash;it might be as high as 5.6 per cent. However, between 4.7 and 5.6 per cent inflation is built into the Fightback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is clearer if we look at the estimated price effects of the Opposition package on some everyday consumer goods. The Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), in his statement of 3 March, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effect of the Opposition package on food products generally will be 8.9% overall (or 9.57% with the effect of road user charges):</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.   <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">fresh fruit and vegetables will increase by 10.1% (11% with road charges).</PARA>

That, according to the Opposition, would be good for the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The OECD's report is about the Australian economy and its prospects; it is not about Fightback. The OECD has not analysed Fightback. If it did, it would find&mdash;as Treasury, Finance and the Taxation Department found in their analysis prior to the Treasurer's statement in March&mdash;that there is, as I have already said, an in-built inflation of between 4.7 per cent and 5.6 per cent, which we can ill-afford now; that there is, and we seem to have forgotten this in recent months, a $4 billion fiscal hole which still has not been filled by the Opposition; and that the distributional effects of the package are, in fact, illusory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will quote again from the Treasurer's statement of 3 March 1992. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indeed, so far as it is possible to follow the consumption tax money trail and using the Opposition's methodology. . . that trail leads to an outcome where over 70% of households of full-time wage and salary earners and about 60% of self-employed and farmer households would be worse off under the Opposition's proposed arrangements. . . In particular, the Treasury analysis shows that wage and salary earner and self-employed and farm households on incomes of $90,000 a year and above would be better off by between $15 and $105 a week&mdash;that is, by up to $5,460 a year better off.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By contrast, married full-time wage and salary earners with non-working spouses and children, and family incomes up to $57,000 a year, would be worse off by up to $8 a week&mdash;that is, up to $400 a year worse off.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similarly, self-employed and farm households with incomes up to $61,000 a year would be anything up to $12 a week worse off. . . Further, the Treasury analysis shows that, under the Opposition's preferred Scenario C on the tax measures alone&mdash;that is, not factoring in any other changes&mdash;all people paying tax on incomes below $40,000 a year would not be adequately compensated both for bracket creep and for the price effect of the Opposition's package. That is, the Opposition's own proposed tax scales would not compensate low and middle income earners for its new food and clothing tax. . . For example, a taxpayer on an income of $30,000 a year would receive a tax cut of 6.8% under the Opposition's announced plan but, after taking account of bracket creep and the CPI impact of the consumption tax, taxpayers on this income would still suffer a decline in real disposable income of some 2%.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thus, while taxpayers on an income of $30,000 a year would be $9.20 a week worse off, people on $100,000 a year would be $73.20 a week better off.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In other words, taxpayers on $30,000, would receive a tax cut which would be only about three-quarters of that necessary to compensate for the introduction of the consumption tax. But people on $100,000 would get a tax cut which is almost double that which would be adequate to compensate them for the reduction in their purchasing power.</PARA>
<PARA>The point of quoting that passage of the report is that the distributional effects of the package, which are made much of by the Opposition, simply are not there; they are illusory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the OECD were to do an analysis of the GST and the Fightback package, it would find not only that it is grossly regressive, despite vain attempts at compensation, but also that it contains in-built inflation which would blow apart the advantages we now enjoy over our trading partners. In the light of this, it is doubtful that any OECD analysis of Fightback would have contained any comfort for the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Add to this the fact that small business people and self-employed people will become unpaid tax collectors, and I think we have an almost unworkable scheme. It will mean, for example, that those small business people and self-employed people will suffer a massive increase in red tape&mdash;inflicted by an Opposition that claims it is going to get rid of red tape&mdash;as they attempt to record returns and collect and pay taxes on all the goods they produce and services they provide. It will mean massive increases in administration as they try to assess and claim rebates for inputs. It will mean that they will bear the brunt of compliance costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we take the UK experience, following the introduction of the value added tax, which is very similar to the GST being proposed by the Opposition, we see that compliance costs in that country are 260 times greater for smaller companies than they are for big business. The smaller companies are the ones which are going to bear the brunt of the cost of compliance with this tax. Small business people and self-employed people will become the unpaid tax collectors for the Government. I think, once they find that out, once it sinks in&mdash;the Opposition has not told them yet, but certainly we will&mdash;there will not be too many of them prepared to vote for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More fundamental than all of this are other elements of the package which draw a clear distinction between the Government and the Opposition in the way each approaches the question of economic reform. The Opposition seems determined to apply the blowtorch to the economy. It is a macho approach which was best expressed by Senator Chapman when he was speaking: nothing is going fast enough; reform is not fast enough; crash through and we will make sure that reform happens regardless of the chaos which it leaves in the process. It sets Australian against Australian. It is a return to the confrontation of previous years&mdash;the Fraser years, for example. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Policies which the Opposition has announced as part of the Fightback package in health, education, welfare and industrial relations are, I believe, cruel, brutal policies, which this nation will not accept and which will be thrown out by the electorate when it gets a chance to vote on them. I believe the Australian people have already shown that in the Ashburton by-election in Western Australia, which was fought not by our choice but by the choice of the Opposition on the GST. The Opposition achieved the startling swing of about 3 per cent in a by-election atmosphere in Western Australian circumstances&mdash;which I think is an abysmal result&mdash;and we won the seat handsomely. It was the GST which won that seat for us primarily, although we had a very good candidate as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By contrast, the Government has gone to great lengths to involve all parties in the process of reform. It has done this to make sure that, once consultation has occurred, reform is accepted by all and that the reforms, once accepted by all, are lasting as a result. Much has been achieved in workplace reform, award restructuring and industry reform. I would like to quote again from the report, which makes that point itself. Page 57 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Significant progress has been made in deregulation of domestic aviation, introducing competition into telecommunications, enhancing efficiency in transport (shipping, rail and road), liberalising foreign investment, and privatising or corporatising government business enterprises, as well as a start in rationalising State and Commonwealth Government functions.</PARA>
<PARA>So the report recognises that significant reforms have been made. On tariffs, page 73 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To date, the single most important structural reform undertaken was the decision to cut Australia's high tariff rates unilaterally in the early 1980s. . . The 1991 extension will ultimately reduce average tariffs to about 2 per cent in the next decade.</PARA>
<PARA>So the report concedes that as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the Opposition's jibes in this area, it is worth noting that on a recent visit to this country the Secretary-General of the OECD, M.

<PARA>The United Nations has proclaimed 1994 as the International Year of the Family, and rightly so. The stability of society is a reflection of the stability of the family. I regret to say that family life is breaking down in Australia and, unfortunately, this is manifested in many antisocial activities, particularly by young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Institute of Family Studies has an important charter: to identify and to meet the public need for reliable and policy relevant information about factors affecting marital and family well-being in Australia. Unfortunately, the Government's priority to family issues must be questioned, particularly if one looks at this Government's financial contribution to the Institute of Family Studies. In fact, the Board of the Institute is concerned about the stagnation of its budget in recent years and has constantly argued for a larger appropriation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the budgets granted to other bodies. In 1990-91 the Institute received $2.72m. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission received $8.9m; the Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies received $5.3m; and the Australian Institute of Health received $4.9m. I do not wish to criticise the absolute grants to each of those bodies, but I think it is significant that the Institute of Family Studies ranks well below each of those. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern is not only as to these absolute amounts but as to what is happening in terms of percentage increases and growth. We see from the report that the Institute has been less well off. For example, the Australian Institute of Health has had a 56 per cent increase over the past two years; the Australian Institute of Criminology an 18 per cent increase; the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission a 56 per cent increase. The Institute of Family Studies received an increase of only 10 per cent. That 10 per cent increase in funds was mainly for a long-awaited computer upgrade which, in effect, was a one-off gain rather than an ongoing appropriation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears that this Government is requiring the Institute of Family Studies to do its important work with one hand tied behind its back. In fact, it says that several approaches have been made for external funds for research&mdash;for example, for the disabled&mdash;but without success. In fact, the Institute has contributed papers to the national inquiry on community violence. This is an area that demands much better research than has yet been done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the Institute is not eligible to apply for additional funds from the Australian Research Council. In fact, it has not been able to receive grants from charitable trusts because it does not have tax exempt status under section 73 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. I remind the Senate that in recent years the Institute's budget allocation to core, basic staffing has grown because of salary increments, retention rates and superannuation. The problem is that the Institute is left with very little money for variable costs with which it can contribute to new research. Thus, I put it to the Senate that the Government expects this Institute to perform vital work but with one hand tied behind its back. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to the report of the Institute of Family Studies. I want to give credit where it is due because I believe that over the years this Institute has been doing very useful work in putting on the public record more and more information about families. For example, in the last year the Institute did a valuable study on the Defence families of Australia. It is incredible&mdash;in fact, I could not believe it when I came to this place six years ago&mdash;just how little information there is on the dependants of the Defence Force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In most cases, the dependants of employees are not all that important to employers, but in the case of the Defence Force they must be vitally important. The Government has a responsibility to house them, to move them from one job to another,  and it has a number</PARA>
<PARA>of allowances to which these families are entitled. Clearly, the Government was not keeping a good enough record of what its responsibilities were and to whom. The Government did not know how many disabled children it was moving from place to place; it did not know whether they were getting proper education; it did not know whether they needed special education or health facilities; and, if so, how many of them needed such assistance. The report has been valuable. I am sure that the policies to be developed in future by the Department of Defence and the government of the future will rely heavily on the work done by the Institute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also find that outside the Defence area specially useful information is being gathered. I was saddened by a study which was reported in, I think, the December edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Family Matters</EMPHASIS> which referred to a study of mothers and fathers of very young children. I cannot remember the precise figures, but I think that some 60 per cent of mothers and fathers expressed a wish that, in an ideal world, the mother would stay home and look after the children while they were young. However, financial circumstances meant that this could be only a dream. It seems to me that we are failing the children of our nation; we are failing their parents who are battling so very hard in today's economy if we cannot give proper attention to the needs of the families with very young children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Governments make policies based on a whole lot of material. The Institute of Family Studies has always been very careful to give proper attention to the needs of families where both parents are in the workplace. It was very interesting to find parents registering how strongly was the wish that, for some period at least, they could have only one parent in the workplace. I challenge the Government to do more for families with very young children and only one income. I think there is a big lack in that area which must be addressed in policy terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a member of a political party, I find it is extremely useful to be able to turn to the research work done by the Institute of Family Studies for policy development and to look ahead to see what Australia's future needs will be. The year 1994 will be the International Year of the Family. Obviously all Australians will be giving even more attention than usual in that year to the needs of Australia's families. It takes quite a long time to develop policies and programs which are appropriate and needed by the Australian community. We cannot suddenly arrive at 1994 and say, `Wouldn't it be a good idea if we did this?'. Clearly, it is valuable to have the research material which the Institute provides and slowly, in a careful and appropriate way, develop measures which will be of value to Australian families. The Opposition is doing just that. A number of the policies which apply, particularly to women and children, in the Fightback package have been developed from work done by the Institute. In addition, the consultations which I have been having with Australian women are adding to that policy development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the work of the Institute. I remember very well when it was set up by the Fraser Government, a Liberal Government. I believe the Liberal Party has found the work it has done very useful. As Opposition spokesman on the status of women, I have found it very valuable indeed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the Bill is to set in place the final stage of the legislative framework to meet obligations under the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, so that Australia can proceed with ratification of the Convention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the Attorney-General introduced the Crimes (Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Act in 1990 he said that it represented the first step in the process of Australia's ratification of the Convention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ratification of this Convention is in accordance with the Government's ongoing commitment to the international fight against illicit drug traffic and abuse. The Convention seeks to ensure that the international community co-operates in the adoption of a wide range of measures aimed at stemming the illicit drug trade.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Duffy said in August 1990 that ratification of this Convention will achieve one of the aims of the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse, which has the support of all governments in Australia. The States and Territories have been aware of the proposed Convention and the Commonwealth's wish to become a party to it from the beginning of the drafting process in 1985, and their views were sought at each stage of the negotiation process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since that time the Government has continued with a process of consultation and negotiation with all of the States and Territories to identify areas of the Convention which can be given effect to by State and Territory legislation. The purpose of this consultation was to preserve the existing balance of responsibilities in the drugs area. The Government has been, as Mr Duffy said in his second reading speech in August 1990, very much aware of the importance of not encroaching on areas of State jurisdiction in this field, and fully supports the continuation of the cooperative approach to drug law enforcement with the State and Territory governments and their law enforcement agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In particular, the Government has sought State and Territory co-operation in enacting legislation to meet the mandatory obligations which the Convention imposes on parties. This includes legislation relating to money laundering, where the money or property has been derived from a drug trafficking offence against State or Territory law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unfortunately, there have been delays in some of the States and Territories, and some legislation is still to be enacted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Outline  of Proposed Legislation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments give effect to particular obligations created by the Convention. These are obligations with respect to criminalising money laundering, and confiscating the proceeds of drug offences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation relies on the external affairs power and therefore follows the terminology of the Convention where appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, the Bill provides a shorthand description of various forms of conduct which are called `dealing in drugs'. The conduct identified as `dealing in drugs' reflects the activities required to be prohibited under the Convention. Most of those activities are already subject to criminal sanction under existing State and Territory laws. In this Bill the expression `dealing in drugs' does not create offences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, the Bill defines an offence called `a State drug offence'. This is conduct which is both a drug trafficking offence in the terms of the Convention and a serious offence under the law of a State or Territory punishable by at least 12 months imprisonment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Use of the phrases `dealing in drugs' and `serious State drug offences' is merely a way of simplifying the reference to these activities in the later provisions of the Bill. Thirdly, the Bill creates the required offences of laundering money or other property that is known to have been derived from a `serious State drug offence'. These offences are described in much the same terms as those used in the Convention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the Bill makes provision for Regulations to prescribe States and Territories to which the legislation will not apply. This means that the operation of the offence provisions in the Bill will be limited to those States and Territories which have not legislated to create offences of money laundering. Once these States and Territories have enacted conforming legislation, the Regulations will be amended so that the legislation does not apply to them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is intended that these Commonwealth offences will, in the event of a conviction, attract the confiscation provisions of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 with respect to `tainted property'. This is intended to enable compliance with the confiscation requirements of the Convention in relation to those States and Territories which do not yet have confiscation of proceeds legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In applying these new Commonwealth money laundering offences, it will not matter that the conduct which is the `dealing in drugs' offence, for example manufacturing drugs, occurred in one State or Territory, and the money laundering conduct, for example the transfer of property, occurred in another State or Territory. Also, it will be possible that confiscation of proceeds action might be taken against property in a third State or Territory. Even where the State or Territory law is adequate to meet the obligations imposed by the Convention if all of the relevant conduct had occurred there, it may not cover conduct that crosses State or Territory borders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill does not affect the validity of any State or Territory legislation creating money laundering offences or any confiscation of proceeds provisions, and does not limit their operation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Financial  Impact</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not anticipate that the proposals put forward in this Bill will have a significant impact on Government expenditure in the foreseeable future.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order as to whether this does amount to an amendment. It seems to me that it makes it a substantially different motion. In fact, when we were having some discussions on this matter this morning, we not surprisingly interpreted the Government's intention that this matter should commence after the commencement of the next Parliament. Those are the terms of the motion that it put down last week. It does not seem to me that this is therefore an amendment but rather provides a totally new regime to be implemented in effect forthwith. In those terms, the motion that was put to us last week apparently was quite misleading. So I put to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, whether you will accept this as a valid amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>

But instead of being up-front and putting that in as the terms of the motion it wants debated, because it made the mistake and failed to do that the other day, the Government has tried to tack it on the end and call it transitional.

If one looks at the terminology of the motion, essentially it requires that there be a register relating to senators' interests and that within a prescribed period, which is now an amended period in the motion now before the Senate, after the senator is required to make an oath or affirmation or after the passing of adoption of this motion:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . each Senator shall provide to the Registrar of Senators' Interests a statement of&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)  the Senator's registrable interests; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)  the registrable interests of which the Senator is aware&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>relating to family and so on. A penalty is imposed for a senator failing to provide such a statement. He or she would be regarded as being guilty of a serious contempt of the Senate and would be dealt with by the Senate accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter received some attention in a different context last week, and indeed today, when Senator Richardson was asked about his directorship of a radio station in Sydney where he became a member of the board of that station by virtue of his holding certain offices in the Labor Party, and he remained a director after he had left those offices, as I understand it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question as it concerned Senator Richardson essentially was whether he had, pursuant to Cabinet rules on this matter, declared his directorship of that radio station in a return which is provided to the Prime Minister. Senator Richardson's answer to that question was `no', that he had misunderstood or misinterpreted the rules and thought that he was required to do that only in circumstances in which he had what can fairly be described as a pecuniary interest; that is to say, that he stood to gain personal benefit from the directorship. In Senator Richardson's case, he apparently misinterpreted the Cabinet rules. He apologised&mdash;</PARA>

Some people on the opposite side saw that public declaration by me of a directorship and raised a number of questions about whether I could have any conflict of interest arising from that declaration. As I result of that, I resigned the directorship. </PARA>

That is the point.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we debated this issue at earlier times it was always gone through by the Opposition in moments frequently of heat. I hate to suggest to the Opposition that it would be guilty of heat, but it was a more heated debate on the issue and it was very confused. People started to raise all these other questions which are unrelated to the question of a register of interests such as they have in the House of Commons, in the United States, various countries in Europe and in the House of Representatives here in Australia where there is a register of interests which does not seem to cause&mdash;in the silence of the night it might cause some members some angst&mdash;any public concern because it is all there on the record.

There is no reason why subsequently the Standing Committee on Procedure, which deals with the Standing Orders, could not deal with some of the difficulties which members might encounter in being members of clubs or something like that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In some ways he is right about that, but I will tell Senator Hill why in a minute. In 1984, the House adopted a resolution requiring registration of interests. In 1986, we had a debate about it in the Senate. In 1986, the House adopted an amended resolution. In March 1987, Senator Gareth Evans moved an identical motion for the Senate. That 1987 debate was adjourned essentially and fell foul of an election timetable and has not been pursued since. Although there was quite a lengthy period of debate at that time, that motion was referred to a committee. The motion lapsed with the July 1987 election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsequently, in November 1987, this matter was again raised and, in negotiations with Senator Chaney, the then Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, I agreed that the debate should be further adjourned because of the pressing nature of government business and the difficulties for the business list. In 1989, Senator Macklin, the then Democrat Senator, wrote to the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, proposing a joint select committee on the ethical behaviour of MPs, which was a much wider thing. We did not support that at the time and I understand the Opposition did not either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I might summarise the views&mdash;I do not wish to speak at length in this matter&mdash;the matter has had a long history. It has come up again in the context of allegations relating to my colleague Senator Richardson. The fact of the matter is that if the Senate was concerned about this issue it would see that it, the Senate, as distinct to leaving it to Cabinet rules or anything of that kind, ensured that there was a register of senators' interests and it, the Senate, could deal with any question of penalty for a member of the Senate failing to comply with the rules associated with that register. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the situation which the Senate ought to want. If it does want that and there are matters of detail relating to the interests of spouses or membership of organisations and so on which the Senate wanted to deal with, they are appropriate matters which could be dealt with by the Senate, I should have thought, through the committee dealing with the Standing Orders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue at the present time is one of principle: whether we introduce a system as obtains in the House of Representatives, which was formulated following the Riordan Report of the Joint Committee on Pecuniary Interests of Members of Parliament in 1975 and the subsequent report of the Bowen Committee of Inquiry concerning Public Duty and Private Interest appointed by the Fraser Government&mdash;all those years when nothing was done about this issue. </PARA>

When the Government announced what it was doing in 1983, it boasted of this new standard of behaviour that it was going to demand of Ministers in a Labor Government. I remind Senator Button of his presentation to the Senate on 22 September 1983, when he talked about this decision of the Government to require of its Ministers not only disclosure but also a statement of interests. He said the proposals:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Richardson apologised. The Prime Minister said, `I accept the apology; the matter is at an end&mdash;except for the fact that we now want to test the bona fides of the Senate, so we will send the matter back and see where the Senate stands on it'. Even Senator Button would have to admit that that reaches a new level of hypocrisy. The Prime Minister totally disregards the standards that he set down publicly for his Minister when it is politically expedient to do so whilst at the same time saying that he expects the Senate to adopt those standards and comply with them. If there is a better word than `hypocrisy' for that, I cannot think of it immediately. Senator Button went on in that speech in September 1983 to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Ministers are required to resign any directorships in public companies and directorships of private companies unless, for example, such companies operate a family farm, business or investments and the retention of the directorship is not likely to conflict with the public duty of the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA>That relates particularly to the issue concerning Senator Richardson. When he took on this directorship of the relevant radio station, according to the standard and the guidelines that have been made public by his Government and his Prime Minister, he was not entitled to take on that directorship. He may argue that he should not have had to make a disclosure because he should not have taken on the directorship in the first place. But that was just totally disregarded because it suited his purposes for the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may not be a question of some financial or pecuniary conflict. This is related to registrable interests, not just pecuniary interests. The statement and the standards that the Prime Minister said he stands by require that Ministers  disclose other registrable interests so that the public can see that they are not, in dealing with legislation and Cabinet matters, putting themselves in any potential position of conflict. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did we find from Senator Richardson last week? We found that on many occasions apparently matters pertaining to broadcasting legislation&mdash;and they may, incidentally or directly, have affected the radio station of which he was a director&mdash;were dealt with by this Government. At Question Time my colleague Senator Baume read out a whole series of Bills and other matters that could pertain to this radio station. Did Senator Richardson disclose an interest in those matters? On no occasion did he disclose an interest. Furthermore, he said that his notes did not indicate whether he was even present at the debates. He could not find any evidence of a disclosure of interest from Cabinet records either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind Senator Button&mdash;he accepted this himself&mdash;that we are talking about two separate situations. One is the obligation to disclose an interest where there could be a potential conflict. We all accept that. It is not in the Senate Standing Orders, as I understand it, other than in a committee situation. That differs from the House of Representatives. Nevertheless, in our parliamentary business&mdash;we abide by the same standards in the shadow Ministry&mdash;we accept that if someone has a potential conflict of interest, they disclose that. Yet Senator Richardson knew that he was a director of this radio station and knew he was in a potential situation of a conflict of interest, and yet on no occasion did he disclose that interest. That was his first offence. He is guilty of that on his own admission. I forget his explanation for that; I do not think he gave an explanation. Anyway, that has been disregarded by the Prime Minister as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second standard is this register of interests which in some way will enable not only the Government and the Prime Minister but also the public to make some form of assessment as to whether in this instance a Minister was in a potential position of conflict of interest. As I said, Senator Richardson defaulted on that because he failed to put his directorship of the radio station in his statement of interests. That position continued for about two years. Certainly he said that after he became Minister for Communications some little time afterwards he resigned by sending a letter to the Secretary of his political party, which is a rather quaint way of resigning from a directorship. Anyway, he did it, in that event. But that is not the point. The point is that for the previous two years he was a Minister of the Crown and a Cabinet Minister. He continually dealt with matters that could have provided a potential conflict of interest. On no occasion did he disclose to the public in his registration statement that he had that interest. That is his second offence. Again, he is guilty on his own admission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Richardson's only plea on penalty was that he did not appreciate the consequences of what he was doing because it was not a pecuniary interest. That is despite the fact that the document itself, which he signed, makes his obligations absolutely clear. Paragraph 4, headed `Directorships', of the guidelines specifically makes that clear. The explanatory notes to assist Ministers who apparently have trouble filling in their form were revised in June 1991. Paragraph 4 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministers are reminded that they are required to resign directorships in public companies and may retain directorships in private companies only if any such company operates (e.g.) a family farm, business or investments, and if retention of the directorship is not likely to conflict with the Ministers' public duty (e.g. a Minister should question the retention of a directorship in a company in which shareholdings extend beyond the Minister's own family).</PARA>
<PARA>Not only did Senator Button boast about this new standard in 1983 and bring to the attention of Ministers such as Senator Richardson what their obligations are, but the document that Senator Richardson signed made his obligations absolutely clear. He chose not to include this directorship. We really do not know why he chose not to include it. Those closely associated with New South Wales Labor right-wing politics might have a better understanding than others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other day the Prime Minister said, `We all know'&mdash;`we' meaning the Cabinet Ministers&mdash;`that he was a director of that company'. One wonders whether that is the case, bearing in mind the way in which the Labor Party operates. It would be interesting to know whether all the left-wing Ministers knew that Senator Richardson was a director of this company, which I understand is owned by the Labor Party in New South Wales, at the time an which he was debating legislation that affected the interests of that particular radio station. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On both counts the Minister was guilty. The Prime Minister chose to take no action at all. He demonstrated his real attitude to this set of standards&mdash;that is, that we disregard them according to political expediency.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that this matter has come before the Senate on a few occasions since 1983. In 1983 it was debated very briefly. Senator Button spoke about it; Senator Chaney spoke about it. Senator Chaney did not oppose the resolution but raised a number of serious deficiencies in the drafting and said that they should be further considered by the Standing Committee on Procedure which deals with the Standing Orders of this Senate. Senator Chipp agreed with that. He looked in some detail at the deficiencies that he recognised in the draft. The matter was then referred to the Procedure Committee. It was not dealt with again until 1986 when that Committee, in effect, said that the matter was too difficult and that it could not provide any assistance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There was the John Button case that Senator Button has acknowledged tonight, but there were a number of other serious cases. Two of those related to the now Minister Dawkins: one where he failed to acknowledge a bottom-of-the-harbour interest that could have beneficially affected him; and the other when he was put in charge of a government committee looking at the take-over of BHP, and he failed to disclose a very substantial beneficial interest in the Bell group of companies&mdash;an amazing default. As I recall, the then Prime Minister took no action in that regard either. I guess Senator Richardson is not an orphan in this matter. There have been a number of cases where Ministers have failed to reach the standard that the Prime Minister has set for them, but in no case has any action been taken against them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the matter came back to the Senate in 1986. Two speeches were made in relation to it in 1987. Senator Gareth Evans reintroduced the matter during his short period as Manager of Government Business in the Senate&mdash;a period which we all remember but would prefer to forget. Senator Durack responded to it in an interesting speech in which he detailed all the defaults by the Government on its own set of standards. Thereafter, the matter has not been dealt with. Since 1987 the Government has taken no action in pursuit of this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Prime Minister wanted to create a distraction from his embarrassment last week by saying, `I am going to refer this matter back to Senate and test their bona fides', he did not tell the truth. He said in that press statement that the Senate had defeated this proposal on three separate occasions&mdash;1983, 1986 and 1987&mdash;but if one looks through the debates one will find that, in fact, the Senate has on no occasion defeated the proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come now to the issue of merit, having dealt with the politics of the matter&mdash;and for the Government, those are the politics of expediency. We have said before in this place that there are difficult issues to be debated on the merit side of the argument. We have no problem with the question of conflict of interest; that is quite clear. If one has a potential conflict of interest, we accept the obligation to disclose it. We will always do so and suffer the consequences of not doing so, which is more than the Prime Minister will administer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have always said that there are difficulties with the statement of registrable interests, and those difficulties remain. One of them was touched upon by interjection, and that is that this statement treats the owner of one BHP share in exactly the same way as the owner of 1,000 BHP shares. Which one is more likely to be influenced in a matter of potential conflict? The public cannot gauge in any way from this statement which one has a greater interest in the matter. This is an issue that has been addressed but has not yet been resolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another question that was raised in the debates that took place in the 1980s was that of debt.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another example that was raised in earlier debates is that of the interest of minors, who might not be a member's children but minors in whom a member of parliament takes some special interest in providing sustenance and support.

These matters are not dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at the draft, one finds that a committee of senators' interests is proposed. That committee has not yet been set up, so how is it going to carry on its work if it does not exist? To whom is this disclosure to be made if the office bearers have not been provided for in this draft? The House of Representatives introduced changes in the Standing Orders at the same time to provide for these things, so that the office bearers who would have the responsibility of dealing with the information to be provided would be in place to so deal with it. However, in its haste the other night to introduce this proposal for its political purposes, the Government failed to introduce changes to the Standing Orders.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been no indication tonight from Senator Button as to how he proposes to deal with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The haste with which the matter has been brought on was demonstrated by the fact that when Senator Button put forward last week the motion that we are debating today, there was a provision that the new obligation would not start until a month after a new Parliament was sworn in. On reconsideration over the weekend he realised that that was not achieving his objectives so he had to bring in an amendment today to provide that it would start 14 days after the date of passage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So all of the signs are there of undue haste. There is no real urgency in this matter, as has been demonstrated by the fact that the Government has done nothing on it for the last five years.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the last time that this matter was debated in depth in our party room in 1983 there have been very substantial changes in the composition of this Senate. We on this side of the chamber believe that it is only reasonable that senators who have come into this place since 1983 have an opportunity to look at the detail of what the Government is putting up and how it might affect them. They also need to look at the obligations that they will have in relation to disclosing matters that concern their families and the like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the subsequent Opposition speakers will seek that this debate be adjourned for seven sitting days in order that we can have time for a proper party meeting to debate these matters.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Madam Acting Deputy President, you might note that we are not seeking to cause any undue delay in dealing with this matter. It is simply that it has not been possible to have a sensible party room meeting within the time frame that the Government has suddenly provided for us in this matter because it wants a way to get off the embarrassing political hook that it got itself on last week. So, in due course, we will seek that adjournment. We will deal with this matter responsibly and we will come back with a responsible position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can tell the Senate that on the question of conflict of interests we will, as we have always done in the past, be prepared to stand up and acknowledge the potential for conflict. We have been prepared to take ourselves out of such a debate rather than to put ourselves in a position of conflict because we accept the merits of that argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I deplore the way in which the Government has reintroduced this matter in an effort solely to get itself out of a politically embarrassing situation.

The proper behaviour or improper behaviour of Senator Richardson in terms of his directorship of radio station 2HD is a matter that is of concern to many of us.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frankly, it would seem that Senator Richardson signed the undertaking that he gave for disclosure and the like with the same sense of good faith, or lack of it, that he signed the letter of introduction for his mate, Mr Gregory Symons. With the same sense of good faith, he rang up the Governor of the Marshall Islands, ostensibly just as a simple senator and friend of Mr Symons. He used and abused his title as a Minister of state to try to gain influence with the Governor of the Marshall Islands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reference has been made in this place to an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Good Weekend</EMPHASIS> magazine of the Fairfax press which outlines the machinations and duplicity of Senator Richardson with regard to his dealings with his own party. According to the illustration on the front of that magazine, while promoting the cause of the unelected Prime Minister, Mr Keating, he was busy stabbing in the neck the then Prime Minister, Prime Minister Hawke. He was pretending to be a friend and dealing with his difficulties while at the same time knifing him and terminating his period as Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a man whose word one could say at best has to be treated with caution. It would seem that his word with regard to the signing of documentation in this chamber is to be similarly treated. How is it that we can have one standard for the Labor Party and another standard for others? How is it, for instance, that the unelected Prime Minister, Mr Keating, was able to get away with not filing a tax return when he was Treasurer?  This is something that ordinary Australians are prosecuted for. Yet, all he got was a little letter from the Commissioner saying, `<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>Please pop it in. You are a little bit late'. How is it that we have one standard for some and another for others?  Is the expectation that members of the Labor Party can behave in not as high a way as others in the parliamentary process?  Is it expected that their behaviour should be less than adequate just because they are members of the Labor Party?  What an appalling situation it would be if that were the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are discussing the fact that there is a ministerial code. Ministers are the people who form the government. Under our Constitution, they are the executive; they formulate policy. The rest of the members of the Labor Party simply make up the numbers. The Opposition is Her Majesty's loyal Opposition. We are here to uphold the Australian standard and to put the opposing point of view to keep checks and balances in the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have a prominent and powerful member of the Government, of the Executive, who simply did not bother to disclose his directorship of 2KY&mdash;I beg your pardon, 2HD; they go hand in hand as they are both owned and controlled by the Labor Party. We have a situation where the Labor Party is in control of two stations that use the airwaves. Under the ad bans legislation we exempt editorial and so-called newsworthy comment but those stations cannot take paid advertisements from people who want to put an opposing point of view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister, the member of the Executive that makes and determines the policy, is a director of radio station 2HD. Yet the Minister did not bother to resign as he is supposed to be required to do by his own standard of ethics? So, instead of debating in this place tonight, as we should, whether  Senator Richardson should be resigning, a quaint little motion is introduced on the suggestion of the unelected Prime Minister that we should be looking somehow at the Senate as a whole&mdash;that is, the people who do not make up the executive government. What a joke!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main game in this debate is the behaviour of Ministers in the executive Government; the behaviour of this powerful man in the executive Government who managed to knife the previous Prime Minister to elevate his first best mate, the unelected Prime Minister. We are talking about the man who is powerful and who controls. We are talking about the man who has had so much to do with the ad bans legislation&mdash;the banning of freedom of speech. We are talking about the man who was the director of a radio station that can put editorial comment to air that favours the Labor Party side of politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I listened to the so-called editorial that went to air in the lead-up to the Davidson by-election, I thought it was ludicrous that so much time was given to the side favoured by the Labor Party&mdash;to the so-called Independent who had been an endorsed Labor Party candidate twice previously in elections in that electorate and was trying to pretend that she was an independent. She is also the sister of a sitting Labor Party member. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So let us talk about the ad ban legislation and the banning of freedom of speech, a policy enunciated and deliberated upon by a man who had the power to see that editorials could go to air prior to an election but did not bother to stick to the disclosure requirements of the government of the day. And how about the explanation? He just forgot about it! This man of power, this man who had details of numbers, of who was voting for whom, of who had changed their minds. This man just forgot about it. He just forgot to tell the Prime Minister of the day and then he went overseas. When there was a change of government he got the portfolio he wanted. I have it on good authority that former Prime Minister Hawke said that he would still be Prime Minister today if he had given Senator Richardson the portfolio he enjoys now because that is what he wanted most. That is what the previous Prime Minister had to say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">W<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>e are debating whether this Executive Government, this Ministerial rank, has the will to impose its own standards upon itself; has the will to say that this man, Senator Richardson, broke that standard and should resign. But oh, no! Members of the Government have not got the courage to stand up and do that to a mate because that was the mate who put the dagger into the throat of Mr Hawke&mdash;all in the name of mateship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we go with mateship in the extreme. Now we have Senator Richardson, who has not resigned as the standard of ethics required, being apologised for by this unelected Prime Minister, Mr Keating, who wants to set Australian against Australian over the symbols of nationhood; the man who does not know that he is Australian; the man who has to go on bended knee and apologise to a foreign nation for being Australian and for his own heritage. What a disgrace!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the same man who has not got the courage to say to Senator Richardson anything like, `You are admonished. You did wrong'. Oh no!  Instead he says, `I accept your apology: this very powerful man just forgot'. Forgot to tell his colleagues, as he was required to do by law, that he was in fact a director of a company which came within the guidelines of those things that were necessary to disclose. In the context of the ad ban legislation, that cannot be excused. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we set off to discuss apples. What do we get but the Leader of the Government, Senator Button&mdash;whose services I might say Senator Richardson wanted to dispense with. However, the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, was heard to say, `If you think Senator Walsh is a problem when he is not on the front bench, just think what John Button would do to us'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us consider what occurred. Here is Senator Button, the Leader of the Government in this place who cannot even sit here to discuss oranges when he is meant to be discussing apples. He cannot even sit in here to hear this debate because he is probably too embarrassed. Senator Button cannot turn his back on Senator Richardson, who sits behind him, because he might get the dagger in the back. Here was the man who was so powerful that he could control the numbers just forgetting to tell anybody about this important position he had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Hill has moved that this motion be adjourned for seven days so that it can be considered in all its ramifications. But the amendments are important because this Government cries that it wants standards and then denigrates its own standards. The article in the weekend press read, `Why should we be surprised?' Why should we, indeed, be surprised? The Government pretends it has standards, but we all know better. The sooner the election comes, and this unelected Prime Minister sees the wrath of the Australian public, the better. This is just one way in which the Government treats the Australian public. It speaks of standards and then treats the people with hypocrisy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would not have spoken on this matter tonight if the Opposition had accepted Senator McMullan's invitation to debate this motion in a week's time because we do support the Opposition's procedural motion that the matter be held over for seven days to give everybody an opportunity to look at the motion in detail. The motion&mdash;to remind those who are listening on the radio because they may well have forgotten what it was about while listening to Senator Bishop&mdash;deals with the registration and declaration of senators' interests and it is titled a proposed resolution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would certainly agree with Senator Hill that the motion, as it is worded, shows all the signs of being very hastily put together. For that reason alone, it certainly warrants fairly careful consideration. It is not hard to find why this motion might have been hastily put together: because of the Government's embarrassment over Senator Richardson. Because of that very hasty composition of the motion before us, I think it certainly warrants a delay of seven days to look at the matter in considerable detail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I have chosen to speak tonight is to put before other senators precisely those matters in the motion as it is worded which are of concern to us. Let me state right at the beginning that the Democrats are fully supportive of the principal thrust of this motion. We fully support the notion that senators should declare their interests in a wide range of areas so as to either avoid conflict of interest or, where conflict of interest might arise, to make it quite clear to their fellow senators, and also of course to the public, where exactly they are coming from in terms of any vested interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will briefly deal with eight areas that we have identified where the Government needs to look rather more closely at the wording. First of all, in clause 1 (1) the motion talks about notification within 28 days of making or subscribing an oath or affirmation of allegiance. It is interesting that, just tonight, the Government has itself put down a suggested amendment to that very first clause. That itself is a corroboration of my claim that the Government had clearly put this motion together in great haste. As it was worded, it would have meant that present senators would not have been required to make any declaration whatsoever. The declarations would have come into effect only after the next election. So that is something that the Government has already picked up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to clause 1(1)(b)&mdash;Senator Hill has already picked up on this to some extent. It is interesting to note that the spouse's interests of which the senator is aware means, contrary to some of the earlier proposals&mdash;the 1983, 1984 and 1987 proposals&mdash;that the spouse is not required to make a declaration. However, it does mean that the whole matter turns on whether a senator was aware of those interests held by his or her spouse. Any charge in relation to a conflict of interest will turn on that very difficult word `aware'&mdash;how one establishes whether a senator was aware of a spouse's interests. I guess it is easy to establish that a person was aware if there is some corroborative correspondence which is over the signature of the senator. However, to establish that the senator was not aware is a much more difficult task. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 1(2)(c) states that the failure to provide a statement, to falsify a statement or to make a false or misleading statement shall make the Senator `guilty of a serious contempt of the Senate'. Exactly what is a `serious contempt of the Senate'? I take it that it is indeed a very, very serious charge. Rather than simply leave it as in the motion with the succeeding words `and shall be dealt with by the Senate accordingly', it seems appropriate that the Senate should set some more specific penalties in relation to a serious contempt of the Senate. Does it mean a fine of $100, or $1,000? Does it mean suspension from the Senate for a month, or gaol for six months? What exactly is meant by `serious contempt of the Senate'? Clearly, in the context of other contempts of the Senate, a serious contempt of the Senate is serious indeed, and the mind is left wondering exactly what sorts of penalties would fit such a heinous crime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 2 details those particular areas which require revelation and subclause (xi) speaks specifically of gifts valued at more than $250 received from `official sources, or at more than $100 where received from other than official sources'. I do not know whether other honourable senators are confused about this, but I am certainly confused as to exactly what `official sources' actually means in relation to gifts. I am not sure that I have ever received a gift from an official source. I would like to know just what an `official source' is and perhaps the Government could give some consideration to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under clause 2(xii) we are also required to reveal any sponsored travel or hospitality. Clearly, that is far too broad. I would frequently receive a cup of tea from somebody, which would be hospitality under this clause. Do I have to come into the Senate and say that Joe Bloggs has given me a cup of tea or has given me a lift somewhere in his car, which would go to the matter of travel? Clearly, some qualification of this is required so that we know exactly how much sponsored travel and hospitality amounts to a sufficient amount to require it to be revealed within the statement or when we get to a particular vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 2(xiii) speaks about revealing membership of any organisation. Again, this is an incredibly broad clause. I think most senators would be members of large numbers of organisations. Most of those memberships would be fairly peripheral and a number of them are associated with being a senator in this place. They would not be particularly close memberships; nor would they be ones which involved a great deal of support either for from the organisation. One wonders whether perhaps that clause could be tightened so that it is closer associations with particular organisations that need to be revealed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subclause 3(c) talks about the tabling of declarations in the Senate. Quite clearly, the tabling of the declaration in the Senate makes this document&mdash;which includes all interests of all senators&mdash;a public document. Why then should the motion go on to talk about making the document available to any person? It seems to me that anybody who gets hold of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> would be able to get hold of the documentation. It is quite superfluous to then require that it be made available to any person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the eighth point that we would draw the Government's attention to concerns clauses 4(a) and 4(b). Clause 4(a) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)at the beginning of his or her speech if the Senator participates in debate in the Senate, committee of the whole Senate, or a committee of the Senate or of the Senate and the House. . . the declaration shall be recorded. . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is quite reasonable, because a person who is indulging in a debate presumably knows what the matter being debated before the Senate is and can quite readily and summarily make a declaration. However, clause 4(b) goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)as soon as practicable after a division is called for in the Senate, committee of the whole Senate, or a committee of the Senate or of the Senate and the House if the Senator proposes to vote in that division, and the declaration shall be recorded. . . </PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me that this is really quite impracticable. Can one imagine for a moment a division being called on some obscure amendment, as is often the case, senators trooping into the chamber, most of them&mdash;particularly those on the back bench&mdash;having not the least idea what the matter is before the Senate or what particular interests they may have which may conflict with the vote that they are about to take, and yet their being required to get up, presumably one by one, and declare their particular interests? I imagine that a division on a vote on a matter where a lot of senators had a potential conflict of interest&mdash;such as one involving shares in large companies, which was the example mentioned earlier by Senator Hill&mdash;rather than taking some 10 minutes, could take half an hour as senator after senator got up and detailed all those interests which had to be revealed before the vote could be taken. While in principle that seems an eminently sane and sensible thing to do, in practice it is quite impractical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a number of matters at the edge of this debate which the Democrats have identified. We have not yet had a chance to debate them in our party room at considerable length. There may be other matters that we would like to raise later. But I wanted to put on the record those matters at least, so that the Government and other honourable senators could address those issues and come up with workable solutions. In principle, we support this motion. We believe that interests should be declared. We support Senator Hill's suggestion concerning a procedural motion to have the matter held over for seven days so that those matters at the fringe can be given a great deal more consideration. We hope that we will then be able to come forward with a motion which meets all the necessary requirements in terms of principle, but does not leave these ragged edges which will either produce problems later on or will prove to make the working of the resolution quite impracticable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Acting Deputy President, at the conclusion of my speech, there are to be two other speakers from the Opposition side. I had occasion earlier today to talk about the hypocrisy of the Australian Labor Party, which controls the present Government, in relation to the matter of the national flag&mdash;a party which denigrates and trivialises the flag but still, in what I can only claim is a fit of hypocrisy, displays it prominently on that Party's logo. Here we are again tonight talking about further hypocrisy of the Labor Party and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in relation to the matter of disclosure of interests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question, of course, has come before us tonight because the Prime Minister had a fit of pique at one of his mates being questioned about his failure to disclose; about his business dealings; and about some representations he made to a foreign government, a head of state, on behalf of another mate apparently. Because the Opposition chose to have the temerity to question a Minister of the Crown about that particular matter, the Prime Minister came back and demanded that the Senate pass some sort of motion as to disclosure of interests. In the midst of all that hypocrisy, it really makes one wonder why we bother with these interest declarations. This Prime Minister and this Government just do not want to enforce the rules when they are laid down. Why bother to do this if the Prime Minister and the members of the Labor Party ignore completely the rules and regulations made as to disclosure of interests?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For this reason, I support the amendment Senator Hill will be moving later to condemn the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Richardson) for his failure to disclose; to condemn the Prime Minister for his failure to discipline Senator Richardson for his breach of duty and his hypocrisy in demanding standards of senators, which he has demonstrated he will disregard according to political expediency. I think it needs to be emphasised again tonight that there is this wilful hypocrisy, this wilful disregard, by the Prime Minister whenever it suits his political purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I enjoyed Senator Button's quite interesting and entertaining little speech earlier today. I suggest to Senator Button that when Senator Richardson finally gets that knife into him Senator Button would do very well either in the theatre or possibly back at the Bar, because it was a cute little speech and demonstrated how he can twist and turn the words. Senator Button, as I understand it, said that Senator Richardson&mdash;or `Richo', as he called him&mdash;was not at fault because there is no penalty provided for in the rules requiring disclosure by Ministers. No penalty provided for!  What about the Prime Minister exercising some honesty and discipline over his Ministers? Is that not a penalty?  Should the Prime Minister not do what Liberal Prime Ministers have done on many occasions in recent history, and that is call for the resignation of Ministers that those Liberal Prime Ministers have believed have transcended proper rules and behaviour in this particular chamber?  Could the Prime Minister not have done that?  It did not have to be written in the regulations; it did not have to be spelt out. We expect that our nation's leading figure, the Prime Minister, will discipline his Ministers and will make sure that they behave with propriety and honesty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Strangely, I agree with some of the comments Senator Coulter made in pointing out that this particular motion is very laxly drawn; it has holes in it a mile wide. One would not need to be a very clever lawyer to find the loopholes in it&mdash;and I want to mention some of those. I also draw the attention of honourable senators to the matters that Senator Hill raised and also to the matters which Senator Bishop very clearly and concisely put before this Senate on this particular issue. I noticed that Senator Faulkner was most vocal in his objections and interjections to Senator Bishop. He, of course, has the opportunity to speak. I doubt whether he will; he very seldom does. One can always tell when Senator Bishop is getting close to the truth, when the points are really starting to hit their mark. That is when we hear Senator Faulkner start with his mindless interjections and that is when we know Senator Bishop is on the right track. I congratulate her for getting to that point so soon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This motion, as Senator Coulter has pointed out, is very loosely drawn and talks about `the registrable interests of which the Senator is aware' having to be declared. Of course, how anyone proves that an honourable senator is aware, except in the most obvious cases, is very much a matter of conjecture. The motion really means that these rules will not have any teeth at all. These rules will not in any way be able to be properly administered. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at Mr Keating's disclosure and what he said. He said, `. . . trustees for our children's minority share interest in the previously mentioned Plueron Pty Ltd'. He is supposed to say the name of the trust, the nature of its operations and the beneficiaries of the trust. He certainly has not disclosed the nature of the operations. Perhaps that is not a major point; perhaps it does not mean much. Mr Keating is simply choosing to ignore the rules where it suits him. He cannot be bothered filling in the form which asks for the nature of its operations. Perhaps Mr Keating is too lazy; perhaps he does not understand. Whatever the reason might be, it is not particularly relevant. The fact is that Mr Keating chooses to ignore the rules that are laid down in disclosure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating says that he has some shares in Plueron Pty Ltd. What Plueron Pty Ltd does, owns, is involved in, is anybody's guess.

I am sure it does not&mdash;I do not think Mr Keating would be that clever. But we never will know because under the rules it appears that one does not have to disclose the assets of any private companies in which one is involved. Where one is required to mention the nature of operation of trusts, the beneficiaries of trusts and the names of trusts, Mr Keating simply ignores that and refuses to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this is another appalling hypocrisy by the Labor Party. It has brought this in as an attempt to intimidate the Liberal Party and National Party, to stop them from questioning Senator Richardson about why he failed to disclose, why he did not bother telling us about 2HD, the Labor Party radio station. That radio station must be worth a lot of money. The Labor Party in Queensland used to own 4KQ and sold that radio station for $16m. It must have been a fairly profitable station; it must have had some assets. Maybe 2HD, in the years that have gone by and taking inflation into account&mdash;which has been pretty tremendous since those days&mdash;is worth an enormous amount of money.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that the Minister for Transport and Communications has chosen not to disclose that in his statement of interest.

It is a serious breach. The Prime Minister had the solution in his hands and should have disciplined the Minister.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5. That the Senate condemns</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) the Minister for Transport and Communications for failing to disclose a registrable interest, namely that he was a director of commercial radio station 2HD, in breach of the Ministerial Statements of Interest as adopted by the Government: and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) the Prime Minister Mr Keating for his failure to discipline Senator Richardson for his breach and his hypocrisy in demanding standards of Senators which he has demonstrated he will disregard according to political expedience.</PARA>
<PARA>My colleagues have drawn attention to why this motion has come before the chamber this evening. It has come before the chamber because of Senator Richardson's failure to disclose his interest and role in radio station 2HD. It was very interesting to look at what happened when this issue first arose in the other place and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was pressed on this issue. The reading of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> will show that at no time was the Prime Minister prepared to defend or enforce the rules. The Government has decided that Ministers have a responsibility to disclose interests and bring them before the Cabinet and, where needed, before the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can ask ourselves: why was this? Tom Burton mentioned in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> that the Prime Minister had failed in his first test on ministerial standards. As my colleague Senator Macdonald pointed out, the Prime Minister failed to indicate in any way to the Parliament, to Senator Richardson, that he frowned on this considerable lapse by a senior Minister of the Crown. Mr Keating failed in his first challenge on ministerial standards. We can ask ourselves: why did he do this? Is it because our Prime Minister lacks standards himself?  That is certainly a debate which has been joined many times in this chamber. In my view Mr Keating while Treasurer of this country lacked standards, and he lacks standards now that he is Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating has shown time and time again that he is prepared to mislead the Australian people. For example, he has failed to ensure that the Australian people are properly informed about the nature of the crisis facing the country. We can see this in constant comments about whether there would be a recession. All of us can remember during the last election Mr Keating's constant promises that there would not be a recession. We can all recall the debate before the last election as to whether any agreement had been reached between Mr Hawke and Mr Keating with respect to the transfer of the great prime ministerial office of this country after the election. Of course, time and again the people were assured that no such agreement had taken place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not that Senator Richardson is wary of disclosure in all cases. In fact, my colleague Senator Bishop drew attention, rather effectively, to an article which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Good Weekend </EMPHASIS>last weekend. The cover story is entitled, `The Execution of Brother Bob'. If honourable senators have not read that article, I suggest that they read it. It shows that Senator Richardson is prepared to disclose an awful lot. He disclosed to the author of the article the role that he played in the execution of `Brother Bob'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we cast our minds back some years, we will recall that there was a problem in our own Party concerning the issue of a change of leadership. Some colleagues unwisely decided to talk about their particular roles. I suggest that what we have here is <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> with a vengeance because Senator Richardson has made these disclosures through sheer vanity and, as Senator Michael Tate would know, this does nothing to advance the cause of the Labor Party and the standing of the Prime Minister and it does nothing to console the former Prime Minister who has lost office as a result of the machinations of Senator Richardson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A few particular sentences should be recorded in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> from `The Execution of Brother Bob' because I suspect they show that there could have been only one source of the disclosure in this article on how the former Prime Minister of this country was tossed out of office.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can then ask ourselves why Mr Keating, faced with what Senator Richardson called an oversight&mdash;but something which others may call gross carelessness and have other vies on&mdash;could not bring himself even to admonish Senator Richardson in the smallest possible way. Instead, the Prime Minister decided to bring forward, as a matter of urgency, the motion which has now come before this chamber. I suggest that the Prime Minister will not admonish Senator Richardson in any way because Mr Keating owes Senator Richardson an awful lot. Senator Richardson was the chief of staff who, while serving Mr Hawke, conducted the campaign to ultimately ensure that Mr Hawke was removed from his great office by a small majority of the Labor Caucus, thereby installing Mr Keating as Prime Minister of this country without his ever having to face an election by the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is really why we have this debate in the Senate this evening on the failure of Senator Richardson to conduct himself properly in terms of the full responsibilities required of a man in his high office to disclose his interests.

It is certainly improper for that person to be in attendance at such Cabinet meetings and for that person not to formally state his interest. But the key thing is that he should not have had that interest in the first place. The lack of standards that is evident in this Government is overwhelmingly revealed in this situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Richardson simply does not understand propriety. He does not understand what it is right to do. Apparently, he cannot tell right from wrong, having been involved in so many curious activities in the past. It is like Rex Jackson, the imprisoned and former New South Wales Labor Minister for prisons who sampled the consequences of his own establishment. He was quite genuinely shocked that he should be attacked and imprisoned for doing what he understood everyone in the Labor Government at that time was doing anyway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that Senator Richardson is not the only person who apparently does not understand the difference between right and wrong, who does not understand the requirements that the Government has theoretically imposed on its members. For example, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr McLeay, when asked to disclose in his register of members' interests shareholdings in public and private companies, including holding companies, indicating the name of company or companies, alongside the word `spouse' wrote the words, `Nil known to me'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had some discussion tonight about the extent to which a spouse has the capacity to know whether his or her partner has interests in various companies. The clear indication given by Mr McLeay on the basis of `Nil known to me' is that it is not necessarily so that Mrs McLeay has no shares but that it is not known to him whether she has shares. That is an interesting situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the matter of John Brown, a former Minister, the principle was quite properly established by his wife that there was no reason why she should be required to reveal the interests that she had acquired as a result of her own efforts. It seems grossly unfair that women who have worked hard and effectively to build up assets&mdash;assets which do not impinge necessarily on the activities or determinations made by their husbands&mdash;should be obliged to reveal what they are. Why should a woman be disadvantaged even more by being married to a politician than she already is disadvantaged by being married to a politician? That applies equally to males who are married to female politicians. It seems quite extraordinary. But apparently it is not so extraordinary as it is difficult for people like Mr McLeay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much to his chagrin, no doubt, an article appeared in  the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Eastern Herald</EMPHASIS> of Sydney on Thursday, 16 April relating to a former mayor of Marrickville. We hear a lot about mayors and activities of Marrickville. Marrickville is in Mr Leo McLeay's electorate and it is where the Enmore conspiracy took place and where Senator Richardson's great friends Messrs Domican and Meissner were heavily involved&mdash;both of them criminals, of course. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Eastern Herald</EMPHASIS> reveals that $72,000 in rates is owed by a company, B.R. Jones and Bros Pty Ltd, to the Marrickville Council and that it was threatened with legal action last year to recover the debt. The interesting thing is that B.R. Jones and Bros Pty Ltd is the company of which the principal executive officer and the major shareholder is Mr Barry Jones, the former mayor of Marrickville and now an alderman of Marrickville, whom Senator Richardson has described as a close friend. He is also a close friend of Mr McLeay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Mr Jones was initially asked whether Mr McLeay's wife had shares in this company, he denied that the McLeay family had any involvement in B.R. Jones, saying, `They've got  no involvement whatsoever'. Asked whether Mrs McLeay held shares in the company, Mr Jones replied, `Ah, I'd have to check that'. The fact is, of course, that documents lodged with the Australian Securities Commission list as one of the company's six shareholders Mrs Janice McLeay, the wife of Mr Leo McLeay, the Federal MP for Grayndler and Speaker of the House of Representatives. Mr Jones, the proprietor of this company, just happens to be one of Mr McLeay's mates and, of course, one of Senator Richardson's close friends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it not incredible that Mr McLeay can say in his declaration of interests that he had no knowledge of shares held by Mrs McLeay in a company run by his close mate, Barry Jones? It is absolutely incredible, yet we are asked to believe this document signed by Mr McLeay. By golly, his word must be worth a lot if he is prepared to sign something like that. He expects anyone, everyone, to believe that he did not know his wife had shares in the company run by one of his best mates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the sort of thing that brings this Parliament into disrepute.

It is hypocrisy in the extreme. We have to ask ourselves: what is the Government really about? For example, it seems to me that if Senator Richardson wanted to give us a token of his bona fides and if the Labor Party wanted to give us a token of its bona fides, we could perhaps have Senator Richardson and Mr McLeay going back through their declarations of interests and telling the truth&mdash;saying what these interests really were. </PARA>

We could have a couple of people up on that score, I imagine. It would be interesting to see whether the former Prime Minister would be prepared to reveal how much it cost to renovate his Elizabeth Bay property and who paid the bill. It would be interesting for Senator Richardson to say how much his North Shore property cost to be substantially renovated, who did the work and what the bill, if any, was. </PARA>

I withdraw the comment I made about Mr McLeay not having released that statement. All we need to do is ask Mr McLeay when his wife acquired that interest. It is certainly not in the latest statement that I have. If Mr McLeay's wife had taken that interest some time before the May 1991 statement was released, that is another matter.

This evening we have already heard, and incorporated into our amendment to the motion, the situation of Senator Richardson as far as his directorship of the radio station in particular was concerned while a Minister of the Crown and not having declared that interest.

Senator McMullan's point requests the Chair to reinforce the ruling that I have already given that any senators speaking now, including Senator Chapman, must address themselves to the element of seven days in the adjournment. I will clarify that. In more correct procedure the Senate would have had two motions before it: one, that the matter be adjourned, which is not debatable; and the second, that the adjournment be for a period of seven days, which is debatable. Strictly speaking, the only element of the matter before the Chair at the moment is the question of the length of time of the adjournment. On that point, I reinforce the earlier ruling.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleagues and I have been criticised by our friends and by people all over the State. Most of these people desperately want to support the project. They would like us to do so. But, one by one, they, too, have come to realise that the project is not worth a row of beans in the form that it is in. The various business groupings, members of the industry and, in most cases, the newspaper media, have now started to read the documents and find out how absolutely worthless this legislation is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a great achievement by Mr Griffiths last Monday week ultimately to meet and discuss with various people the various aspects of this matter. That meeting gave everybody considerable hope that there was still time. I say to the Minister that even at this stage there is still time. I would implore Mr Griffiths not to let the opportunity get away to provide some sort of reasonable working condition, even to the extent of accepting the agreement that he was a party to last week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the last occasion that this matter was debated the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) said that we were intending to cut Mr Griffiths down, or words to that effect. As far as I am concerned, nothing could be further from the truth. I found Mr Griffiths's approach to this matter to be honourable and reputable. I wish I could say that of all the parties, but I can certainly speak that way as far as he is concerned. It would be interesting to ask Government senators who supports Mr Griffiths and who does not; who has gone off on some romp with Minister Kelly, for instance, and so on?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An offer was made in good faith and accepted by the parties at the meeting that was held last Monday week. It is history now that some people ratted on it and that does not do them any great credit. I regret to say that that starts with the Prime Minister. We know that we are now not able to take any notice of what the Prime Minister says. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have spoken with many of the people who were involved in that meeting and the processes that went with it. There is not the slightest doubt as to what happened at that meeting and what the arrangements were. The sort of men that I talked to do not lie about a thing like this. However, we should remember that people who lie about small matters will also lie about big ones. I believe that Mr Griffiths and those with whom he had the meeting were in agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Various people have entered the debate as a result of the discussions that we had in this chamber last week about changes.  I  believe</PARA>
<PARA>that Mr Bacon, who is well known in union circles in Tasmania, also genuinely wants a pulp mill to be built. But why does he not ensure that the Prime Minister is aware of what is involved? Why does he not ask the Prime Minister more often what he is doing about getting the mill going?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not satisfied that anything in this legislation either is going to cover up the lack of goodwill and bona fides that the Government has so far exhibited or is necessarily going to result in the establishment of a pulp mill. The Government has not been able to satisfy us on either of those counts and the legislation does nothing to take away our concerns. It is not good enough to have this type of arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other night we did not cover the important question of the Resource Assessment Commission report. Why is it that the Minister for Resources, the Prime Minister and other Ministers have absolutely refused even to comment about the fact that there has been a Resource Assessment Commission report? How can the Government proceed at a time like this without even mentioning this report, without even coming back to the recommendations which are totally in conflict with the legislation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the answer? We expect to be able to get answers. We cannot tolerate this type of legislation, which the Government claims to have been the subject of a great deal of discussion, when the main body of information which it has&mdash;the Resource Assessment Commission report&mdash;makes all sorts of recommendations which are totally contrary to what is mentioned in the Bill?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about all those various agreements in Tasmania? I have here this memorandum of understanding, for instance. It is a very interesting document to have before us. The memorandum of understanding was supposed to be the last and final document, the be all and end all. It was going to resolve all the problems. How long did it last? The ink was still wet at the time this Government moved in and started chopping and changing it around. I will give just a few examples. Page xxxviii states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conflict over forest use will not be reduced if governments continue to rely on ad hoc reactive mechanisms for accommodating the interests of more than one government in the forest use decisions.</PARA>
<PARA>What does the Minister propose to do about that? The Commonwealth Government's Forest Conservation and Development Bill is largely irrelevant to the majority of producers in the forest industry since it applies only to projects of more than $100m. What about that? Will the Minister make sure he answers that? The next part reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The inquiry's preferred approach to resource security is to strengthen and advise agreements between forest management agencies and industries, particularly through the development of enforceable contracts with clear provisions for compensation.</PARA>
<PARA>What about that one? I would like to have an answer to that. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Providing financial compensation if a land use change resulting from the Commonwealth policy or decision causes disruption to industries reliant on the forest resource.</PARA>
<PARA>What are we going to do about that recommendation? The next one reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For improved intergovernmental institutions and decision processes that would support comprehensive forward planning for forest use.</PARA>
<PARA>Are we doing anything about that? Let us just find out how this ties in with this crummy bit of second-hand legislation that we have before us at the moment. The next example I have here reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To bring together all Commonwealth responsibility for forest policy within a single organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All I can see in this is that we have more organisations. I am very happy to be advised by the Minister to the contrary. It is not good enough for us to be still dealing with this when the Resource Assessment Commission recommends to the contrary. </PARA>

He was able to tell us quite a lot about that. I am sorry that neither the Minister, nor anyone else from the Labor Party except Mr Jim Snow was there to hear him because it was really a very good expose on what was going on and on what the recommendations were. If the Minister will, for a start, give me a run-down on where we stand in this legislation in relation to the various points I raised, I will be very pleased.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the last division I was making the point that Senator Coulter and I had invited the Opposition to move its amendment. It specifically declined to do so on Thursday night. We have spent three to four hours debating in the committee stage, but we are not yet past the first clause. I think this makes a mockery of the procedures and turns this into high farce.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I move the following amendment to this Bill, which is the amendment circulated in my name:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 1, page 1, line 4, omit <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">"Development"</EMPHASIS>, substitute <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">"Major Projects"</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA>I understand that is the amendment that Senator Tambling indicated he would move.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move this amendment in order to end this stand-off. As I said in the debate last Thursday, what is in a name? A rose by any name would smell as sweet. Again, that is not an accurate quote from Shakespeare. In case Senator Winston Crane comes in here and says that I have again misled the chamber, I wish to indicate that the quote is near enough but is not quite dead accurate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is that the Opposition was standing on what it called a principle in insisting that the name must change. We will not hold up the passage of this legislation or the opportunity for job creation that it will bring to northern Tasmania. We will not hold up the opportunity of rebuilding the northern Tasmanian economy. We will not thwart the wishes of the Tasmanian Government or our own intent. We will not thwart the intent of the industry. We will make the change ourselves if the Opposition is not prepared to do so, because the change in its nature is not a significant one which fundamentally affects the intent of the legislation. That should pacify the Opposition and cause it to vote for the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point I make is that last Thursday I was interjected on several times by senators saying, `It is not just the name, you know. There are undertakings'. I understand that, in a debate in the House of Representatives on Thursday afternoon, Mr Griffiths, who has just been lauded by Senator Archer&mdash;and I agree with the praise heaped upon his head&mdash;made the Government's position clear in terms of the undertakings sought. I refer honourable senators to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> debate last Thursday and to a passage in it in which Mr Griffiths said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would be a sin of omission on my part were I not also to say that there are differences in terms of the Opposition's desire to see the Government embrace, in a written instrument to itself, undertakings relating to the ongoing monitoring of the legislation and, in the event of the legislation being found wanting, indicating a preparedness to review within a reasonable time frame any shortcomings in the legislation. As a mirror image of that policy position, I might say the same thing in relation to enhanced intergovernmental agreement processes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am quite happy to indicate in this chamber, on the record, that any legislation for which I have responsibility either as Minister for Resources or, for that matter, as Minister for Tourism would, in the normal course of events, be subject to such ongoing monitoring and review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> That means that, if this Bill becomes an Act, Mr Griffiths is committing himself, as the responsible Minister, to monitoring its operation and, if necessary, in view of the whole situation, review its operation and, in reviewing its operation, to consult all of the relevant players in this debate as a normal process of prudent and good government. The undertakings sought by the Opposition are in a similar vein. I put it to the Opposition that, if I have the opportunity at the third reading stage of this Bill&mdash;should it reach that far&mdash;because that seems to be the appropriate place for Government undertakings, I will indicate that this passage in the MPI, which was debated in the House of Representatives on 30 April, is interpreted to mean a commitment to monitor, review and consult and should meet the requirements of the Opposition as it has put them forward. I will say this again at the third reading stage of the Bill. If, for whatever reason, I do not get an opportunity to say that in a third reading speech, I am sure the Minister will make that clear undertaking to all of the players in the industry, and I have his authority to say that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the questions of title and undertaking, the Government has moved some distance to meet the Opposition's requirements. Alas and alack, that does not appear to satisfy it, because I am advised&mdash;although I must say I have not actually seen the document myself&mdash;that Mr Bruce Lloyd has issued a statement indicating that it is the Opposition's intention to oppose this Bill. I understand that the Opposition intends to move laboriously each one of its amendments and, if they are defeated, as I expect they will be, to defeat the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I would counsel the Opposition earnestly not to do that and to take pause and reflect on what that course of action is likely to lead to.

If I am correct in my understanding about that, then I am here to inform the Opposition that it is also my understanding that the National Association of Forest Industries supports the passage of this legislation.

So to defeat this Bill is to defeat that project&mdash;a project which has been described by the proponents as one that would provide 2,000 jobs in northern Tasmania in the construction phase alone and a pulp mill which would have provided the impetus for an economic revival in northern Tasmania. Those were not the Government's words but the words of the proponents of the mill&mdash;to defeat the mill and to defeat those social and economic implications.</PARA>

Given that the Government has moved on the title and on the undertakings, here is a single opportunity whereby the Opposition can do something to create jobs. If the Opposition defeats it, it will be defeating job opportunities for people in northern Tasmania, the economic revival of the northern half of that State and the advantages to the current account deficit, the development of this industry and all of the implications about industry development that flow therefrom. </PARA>

That is not a position that is open to the Opposition which, as I say, with all this synthetic concern for the unemployed, pretends that it can turn this whole debate now into a circus, a farce and a charade.

There are those in the Government who actually want to see a mill go ahead in Tasmania. There are those in the Government who are opposed to it to the last breath&mdash;namely, the Left and those supporting the far Greens. The one thing the Government does not want tomorrow is a debate within Caucus on this important issue&mdash;a debate which might have a chance of bringing the Government to some commonsense and to the point of agreeing to a reasonable compromise that would enable us to support the legislation. It is not just the compromise of the Opposition&mdash;the Minister for Industrial Relations should not shake his head&mdash;but is the compromise as of last week of the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) which would enable passage of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at this in its proper sequence. The proposal for compromise was put by the industry&mdash;by NAFI. The Minister entered into discussions with Mr Lloyd. The Minister said, `I am prepared to buy the compromise, but I want you to take it to your leadership first because I am not going to go to Mr Keating and find that you are going to let me down'. We did the right thing and took it through our processes. We said, `Yes, we will bear the compromise because it will achieve the objective of reasonably project-specific legislation, plus a commitment to the regional plans which will give a chance to the small players in the industry to get protection as well'. It was a reasonable compromise in all the circumstances. </PARA>

Mr Keating said, `We are not going to take that back into Caucus and debate it again because we will be in all sorts of trouble'. This Government is not really interested in this development; it is not interested in proper project management in this country. There is no reason for this Bill to be declared urgent tonight.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to oppose the Forest Conservation and Development Bill being declared urgent, I remind Senator McMullan, Senator Cook and Senator Coulter that while we may have spent two hours and 54 minutes discussing this Bill, many members of the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs&mdash;including myself&mdash;have had a very minimal contribution. I have had only six minutes. Yet we spent three days taking evidence. I also remind honourable senators on the Government side that when the Committee came to vote, it required the casting vote of the Chairman for it to be carried. It was a totally split committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators opposite come in here tonight and use such words as `farce' in terms of the debate which is taking place. This piece of legislation relating to resource security is one of the most important pieces of legislation ever to come before an Australian parliament, because it is resource security in this country that has become a farce; it has been destroyed. There is no confidence in this country of ours right now in terms of investment and getting major projects off the ground. If we get this piece of forest legislation wrong&mdash;and the Committee was divided fifty-fifty on it, albeit for different reasons, in the case of Senator Bell&mdash;the implications for the future are quite enormous. One only has to look at the mining industry in Western Australia as one example. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is our right in Opposition to debate every single word and every clause of this particular Bill because of the implications that will flow from it. It is about time the Government turned around and had a look at the agreement that Minister Griffiths reached with NAFI and the distance to which we were prepared to go. The Government is not prepared to go that distance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am glad that Senator Sherry stayed in the chamber because I took some notes today on what he said at the meeting at which he spoke. Senator Sherry said to the people sitting at the meeting that he supported their position. He said that he was more hopeful today than he was yesterday.

That is the urgency as far as you are concerned. It was totally irresponsible of you to give those people false hopes when you have been overridden. I can understand why you did it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a great deal of emphasis on the Caucus meeting tomorrow, something that the Opposition appears to be fascinated with. It may be said that there are a lot of things which go on around the Senate that I do not know very much about, and sometimes perhaps people accuse me of talking about them in spite of that. But one thing that people generally accept that I know a bit about is the way the Labor Party works and its rules and things. I have been sitting here trying to think of the procedural process by which this matter would be on the Caucus agenda tomorrow if this Bill were not passed. I cannot see what it would be. It will not be on the agenda. How would it get there? Can Senator Tambling explain to me how it would be on the Caucus agenda?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us talk about why this Bill should be urgent. What are the criteria that indicate whether a Bill should be urgent? Firstly, one-off legislation such as this Bill needs to be important. Then we need some likelihood or reasonable apprehension that the Bill will not be passed in a reasonable time under the normal processes of the Parliament. I do not think there is any great disagreement around the chamber concerning the first of those two criteria&mdash;that is, this Bill is important. People might have different views about its merits, and even about how vitally important it is, but overall I think all 76 senators agree it is an important piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is there a likelihood or a reasonable apprehension that this Bill would not be passed in reasonable time in the normal procedures of the Senate? I think it is reasonable to draw that conclusion. We have had a lengthy second reading debate and a lengthy committee review. We have now had at the committee stage more than three hours of debate on the first clause, without an amendment being moved or anything being put to the vote, and there has been an indication of many more amendments. At that rate, quite clearly, it would be a very long time before the Senate, through its normal processes, would come to a conclusion with regard to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By any normal measure of what is an indication of why one ought to move to declare a Bill urgent, this Bill clearly meets those criteria. For that reason, the Government proposed that it should be declared urgent. I think we have had confected outrage from the Opposition. I gave Opposition members notice of my intention to move this, so they all went off and manufactured their outrage. But they know it is a good idea. They probably will be absolutely relieved when this motion is carried and the Bill is off the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>, however they eventually choose to vote, so we can get on with the rest of the important business before the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard this sort of debate by numbers before, with people reiterating their concern about urgency motions when they are in Opposition and moving them with alacrity as soon as they get into government. Let us not have all that manufactured outrage; let us get on with the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a very high element of cynicism in this urgency motion before us tonight. The chamber has before it a Bill which is quite improper and inadequate, and full of loopholes for an unscrupulous government to exploit. We have seen a sad history of exploitation in Tasmania. But for some reason the Labor Party's agenda suddenly changed today. As my colleague Senator Tambling said, the first indication of that change of heart came when the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> itself was changed. Evidently, the Government realised it was going to face some embarrassment from its own back bench, probably at tomorrow's Caucus meeting. So why the change? Why the urgency?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The virtuous words of Senator Cook about wanting a pulp mill have come seven years too late. We all know that Mrs Kelly wants to skittle any successful legislation, which is the second prerequisite demanded by North Broken Hill. If that legislation is killed now, she will be spared that embarrassment. So there was no urgency in 1986-87, when the ALP refused to back John Kerin in his memorandum of understanding, because within six months of that memorandum of understanding being signed, it was broken. The environmental impact statement stated that Jackeys Marsh and the Lemonthyme areas were to be logged. However, the then Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, overruled his Minister&mdash;a familiar story&mdash;and stopped the logging that was to occur in Jackys Marsh. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Helsham inquiry was a consequence of the Jackys Marsh decision. Mrs Kelly will go through this whole ritual again. The Government will try to spare that option. I remind the Senate that there was no urgency then. The Helsham inquiry ran for 12 months and led to the Cook agreement of 1988. I remind the Senate that Senator Cook, the then Minister for Resources, and Mr Ray Groom, the then Minister for Forests, again ratified a forest management system in the areas outside the World Heritage area. The agreement also declared that the Government would not unilaterally impose any more World Heritage areas on Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the urgency in situations such as we have today? This surely demonstrates the hypocrisy of the Government not to put proper legislation in place. It is always looking for the loopholes. We are saying, `Get it right. There is no urgency about it'. The Government will have a very long environmental study which will amount to absolutely nothing. Its track record has been very poor. I submit that there is no urgency on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has taken its time in the past. It has skittled legislation, it has skittled memorandums of understanding and it has disregarded commission inquiries. We, the Opposition, are saying, `Get it right. You need time. There is no urgency. Don't press the matter. Get it right to save all those poor people who are likely to lose their jobs'. We need that mill in Tasmania, but we need it under the right conditions. With the right legislation, the Government will not walk away from it and cause further dismay and anger in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this legislation the forest industry will continue to be in a continual state of uncertainty, crying out for proper resource security legislation. This Bill will not deliver it. The coalition will deliver it. We have promised proper security legislation when we come to power. I submit that this legislation is inappropriate and there is no urgency for it to get through. I call upon the Government to bring in proper amendments in order that the coalition can make sure that we have appropriate legislation to enable a pulp mill to be built not only in Tasmania but also in Western Australia and in Victoria. </PARA>

<PARA>This motion relates to the time that will be allowed for debating the remainder of the Forest Conservation and Development Bill 1991. As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) has been telling us tonight, we are still on clause 1, and the Government has the view that the whole of the Bill can now be disposed of within just an hour and a half. In other words, each of our various amendments can be dealt with, the amendment that the Government is putting can be dealt with, and the arguments for and against each can be disposed of within an hour and a half. It is the view on this side of the chamber that that is totally unreasonable and it does not lead to good legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might say in passing how disappointed we are again with the Australian Democrats. They were elected here to keep the bastards honest, but on each occasion when it comes to the crunch they say, `We'll pass the guillotine this time, but never again'. Each time it recurs they say, `We'll pass the guillotine this time, but never again'. What happened at the end of last session has happened again. We are prepared to sit here as long as is necessary to do the job properly. Why will the Australian Democrats not do likewise?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not such an arduous task to do the job properly&mdash;to finish a debate which is of such serious consequence as this one and deal with our amendments. Our amendments were put in the first instance before the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs&mdash;I agree&mdash;and they attracted widespread support. As Senator Coulter will agree, our amendments attracted the support of the industry; they attracted the support of NAFI, the national body; they attracted the support of FIAT, the State body; and they attracted the support of the unions. They have, in effect, attracted support from everybody except the Government and the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why can we not have the opportunity to put them properly to this chamber and have the arguments in favour of them debated? Why are the Democrats restricting us from that opportunity; restricting our right of speech in this the only chamber in the Parliament where there is any right for proper debate? The Democrats are not prepared to allow us that opportunity. Why? It gets back to the fact that I suspect that this Government actually does not want this Bill to pass. Its dream is that this Bill will be defeated and that it will be able to blame us&mdash;straightforward political motives. There is no interest in the people of Tasmania; no interest in the development of resources in this country. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have taken a consistent and principled position in relation to this legislation from the start. We support the development of a mill in Tasmania. We support proper, reasonable legislation. But we have said from the start that this legislation is fundamentally flawed. You will remember, Mr Chairman, that when the Bill was debated in the other place, we said that what was necessary was for the Bill to be withdrawn and then redrawn in order that small industries can be incorporated and given proper protection, there can be proper project protection and so forth. The Government would not accept that very reasonable suggestion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Bill got to this end of the building and went before a committee, we went one step further and drew the amendments for the Government ourselves. We put each of those detailed amendments during the committee hearing. As I said, the industry and practically every party who appeared before that Committee supported what we were doing, but the Government would not accept it. It said, no, it was not prepared to accept that reasonable compromise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we came back again with yet another compromise and that is the compromise we are talking about tonight which was put first by NAFI to Minister Griffiths who picked it up. We helped the Minister draft it into the form of an agreement&mdash;an agreement which the Minister was prepared to support&mdash;but when it came to the crunch, Mr Keating was not. So for the third time, we looked for a way in which, consistent with principle, we could allow the passage of this Bill. We want resource security legislation and we want a development to go ahead in Tasmania, but this Government is not prepared to allow it to occur. I think that is appalling. Why can the matter not be debated out?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, once again we have a perambulation of convenient reasoning around this chamber by Senator Hill under the guise of a cry from the heart that the Senate has not had enough time to debate this legislation. Anyone who has studied the record knows that the Senate has had more than enough time to debate this legislation. Let me remind the chamber what has happened.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had an exhaustive second reading debate. We have had a committee inquiry. All the issues were canvassed in that Committee, yet the Bill has been stalled for two hours and 52 minutes in the committee stage without even getting to the first clause of the Bill. The Government has pre-empted that process and broken the log-jam by moving the amendment that the Opposition had foreshadowed it would move, and by giving the undertakings that the Opposition claimed it needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would have thought, in the normal course of events, that would have ended the matter. We would have been left with the opposition of the Australian Democrats&mdash;an honourable opposition throughout all this, I might say. We would have been left with that difference of principle and difference of argument. But we now find, despite the Government's moving to accommodate the position of the Opposition, that the Opposition position has changed. The closer we move, the further the Opposition backs away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Hill raised three arguments. His first argument was that we cannot debate the clauses in 90 minutes. I remind Senator Hill that that is 90 minutes plus two hours and 52 minutes that we have been debating the clauses, and in the two hours and 52 minutes in which we have not moved past clause 1, all of the amendments have been canvassed in one way or another&mdash;not necessarily in a very structured way, often in a very slipshod way, by the back bench of his Party in the contributions that they have made. They canvassed them as well in the legislation committee. So let us not have this false pretence that somehow the democratic process is being circumvented by a lack of time. That is a false argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second argument that Senator Hill raised was that the Government does not want the development. I say again that the Government has moved the Opposition's amendment. We have given the Opposition the assurance that we want this development. It is the clear understanding of the Government that the Tasmanian Government also wants it. That is a Liberal government, and it wants it. If this is a States House and the interests of the States are to be considered here, then surely the cry of the Tasmanian Government needs to be considered. Not only that, but judging from the resolution of NAFI&mdash;the one I referred to before&mdash;it wants it. That is our understanding of NAFI's position. If those opposite have a different understanding of NAFI's position, perhaps they had better tell me I am wrong. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now I come to the third point: this continuing argument that the Opposition makes that somehow Minister Griffiths has reached an agreement. I am advised quite clearly that Minister Griffiths reached an agreement subject to&mdash;and always subject to&mdash;a decision by the Government; that he engaged in a discussion and canvassed different points of view and different considerations, but that he did so on the basis that he would take those back for consideration by the Government for a united Government response. All of the crocodile tears that those opposite are crying about Minister Griffiths are in fact disingenuous. They are meant to undermine him. They are meant to pretend that he has somehow done something that he has not done. He has not reached an agreement. He said he would refer those matters back for a Government response, which is what the Government has done. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will only speak for a few moments and I wish to make only two points. Again the implication has emerged in this debate tonight from both the Government and the Opposition that if this legislation is passed, either with or without amendments&mdash;and both forms have been put&mdash;somehow or other a pulp mill will miraculously appear in northern Tasmania. It is on the record that no guarantee exists for a pulp mill to be built with or without any amendment, and that needs to be made absolutely clear.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To bring this issue right up to the minute, the second point I wish to make is that the following statement appears in this evening's AAP:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal coalition tonight decided to scorn the Government's latest compromise on resource security legislation and vote against the Bill when it came up in the Senate later tonight. Mr Lloyd said the Opposition would vote against it unless it was accompanied by a five point agreement thrashed out by resources Minister, Alan Griffiths, last week or the Opposition amendments which failed to get past the Senate Standing Committee.</PARA>
<PARA>It then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The move signals the final death knell for the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA>Any journalist out there can read the signs. What we are doing here brings this chamber into disrepute. The Opposition has made its position clear and the Government has made its position clear. To continue to waste time in apparent debate&mdash;and I stress the word `apparent'&mdash;when really all that is going on is shadow-boxing, brings this chamber into disrepute. For that reason I believe it is absolutely appropriate to set a time limit. Ninety minutes is more than enough to deal with the 17 amendments that the Opposition wants to put, considering the number of times they have been debated already. Therefore, the Democrats will be supporting that 90-minute limit. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is an important Bill. Nobody is denying that it is an important Bill. Because it is such an important Bill, we believe it deserves proper attention. The Government will try to suggest that the Opposition is filibustering, ably helped by Senator Coulter, who is more than using up his own entitlement to time on this legislation. He does not have much to say, but he is perfectly prepared to say it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on this side of the chamber believe that it is very important to get this right. We have tried for months to do something about this legislation. We are continuing to the death knell to try to get it right. We still believe that people on the Government benches would dearly like the opportunity to get it right, too, but they have been silenced by this deal between the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Left faction of the Party which put him into the Lodge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has 17 amendments and has struggled over months to try to get those amendments accepted. They were accepted by the industry, but not by the Labor Party. Eventually, we were persuaded to accept an agreement negotiated by the Minister for Resources, Mr Griffiths, with the industry. After Easter, on his initiative, the industry met with the Minister and settled on an agreement after a couple of days of negotiation. That was then brought in writing to the Opposition to see whether we would give it in-principle support, and we did so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is anybody in this country entitled to accept the word of a Federal Minister? It is a pretty serious question that goes far beyond this Bill. It is not just a question of resources security legislation; it is a question totally of the credibility of this Government and the ability of any one of its frontbenchers to negotiate with credibility on behalf of the Government. The industry understood that when it was negotiating with the Minister, he was operating within the parameters of his own portfolio and was entitled to conclude those negotiations with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister had the rug pulled out from under his feet and we find that the Government is now rushing to dispose of this legislation before Caucus has a chance to express its view. On Friday on the ABC news the member for Eden Monaro, Mr Snow, said there were two groups who mucked up this legislation; one was the left wing of his Party and the other was the executive of his Party, which would not take the legislation back to Caucus. Obviously, Mr Snow would like to have got it back to Caucus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about Senator Sherry, who has been making kind and consoling noises to the industry? I have the distinct impression that Senator Sherry would like to have that legislation taken back to Caucus too, but he seems to be either ineffectual or silenced. What is it with Senator Sherry? We know that the Leader of the Opposition in Tasmania, Mr Field, also wanted it to go to Caucus. Perhaps it is Mr Field's evidence to the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs that really puts its finger on what is happening. He said in his evidence:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What I see is that the Left of the Labor Party has grave reservations about the principle of resource security, and there are some in the Right who think that it would be politically expedient if it did not succeed.</PARA>
<PARA>The evidence of Mr Field to the Committee was several weeks ago. Clearly he was right; he could see what was happening. Mr Keating had a deal with the Left even then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One has to ask: why is the Government so afraid of its own Caucus?  Let us not misunderstand what happened to this agreement. The agreement between the Minister and the industry was not just on a change to the title of the Bill. It also included an agreement that he would monitor its effectiveness together with industry and trade unions; that he would develop the concept to cover regional agreements and smaller industry players not included by the $100m plus projects; and that he would develop a national forest strategy. That was the agreement that we were prepared to support, not just a change of title to this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us be quite clear: when the Government is prepared only to go down the line of changing the title to the Bill, we believe all bets are off. If the Government is not prepared to stand by Mr Griffiths' agreement, we want our amendments to this legislation. Why is it that we cannot get this through? The Australian Democrats are ready to agree that the Bill is urgent. They do not support the forest industry; they would not want to see a pulp mill in Tasmania, as we do; and they do not want this Government to take this Bill to the Caucus. We have taken a very consistent line on this legislation. We have been prepared all along the way to try to find a solution to this legislation. The Minister has been dumped and now the industry will pay the price. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the first time that I have spoken on this matter. I regard the comments that are being made around the chamber about the Forest Conservation and Development Bill having been thoroughly debated to such an extent that it should be declared urgent and that the committee stage should now be truncated to 90 minutes as a denial of the rights of those senators who have not yet spoken on the matter. We have attempted to listen so far as we can to the debate. I have observed what has been said in the report of the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs that considered this Bill. If one has a look at that report, one will note that this Bill seems to be a most extraordinary creature because all of the major players&mdash;the unions and the industry&mdash;desire to see amendments to this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In those circumstances, it seems to me that it is extraordinary to declare this Bill urgent and, in particular, to truncate the committee stage so as to prevent a proper explanation being given by the movers of the amendments for the reasons that those amendments ought to be carried. I will not go through them, because I think that might border on being contrary to Standing Orders, but in fairness we ought to debate the amendments in the committee stage. I would like to hear some debate across the chamber. I would like to hear in detail from the Government why it opposes these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I have a feeling that, in the long run, the Democrats want to see this Bill not so much declared one of urgency as one doomed urgently. That, I think, is the distinction. I am very disturbed, frankly, that the Democrats have again sided with the Government to support the guillotine. It is an extraordinary situation. We have had the Government and the Democrats saying, `The fate of this Bill is known'. How do they know that?  There may be people from the Opposition who will in the end join in voting for the Bill. How do they know that it is doomed?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats want this Bill doomed. That is why they are supporting the Government in these procedural motions. But, if the Government suspects that there is any chance at all of this legislation being supported, what it ought to do is withdraw the Bill; not to make it one of urgency in the full knowledge that it will be doomed tonight. I say to Senator Cook that we are at a threshold point. In Senator Cook's negotiations, as in my union negotiations, he should be backing off or withdrawing at this point in time to allow things to settle down. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the opportunity to make the last of my comments. The procedural options are starting to run out, which is regrettable because debate on the substantive motion will be unreasonably curtailed. When that occurs in the Senate it is a sorry day, yet it seems to be occurring regularly now with this Government with the support of the Australian Democrats.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take up the point that was made by both Senator Newman and Senator Harradine. I must say that, as an outsider,  I nevertheless have looked at this legislation, travelled down to Tasmania, visited APPM and talked to Tasmanians. I find it very difficult to understand why the Government has not been prepared to accept the very reasonable amendments that have been put as a compromise at each of the stages. Why was the Government, in the first instance, not prepared to withdraw the Forest Conservation and Development Bill and redraft it in a way that was requested and would meet the requirements of small industry and enable it to be incorporated within regional plans so that one would not have to have a duplication of environmental protection? That is not in any way reducing the environmental standards. Why would the Government not accept a responsibility to do that in order that a Bill might be passed and a Bill might maximise the opportunity of development in a State such as Tasmania, but yet development that is environmentally satisfactory? That was difficult to understand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, we appreciate that governments do not like to be told how to do things, and perhaps the Government was simply being obstinate. But in the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs, when the amendments were put by the Opposition in detail accepting and developing this Bill as a project specific Bill but additionally providing for the sanctioning of regional plans that had gone through the State Government processes and protection assessments, why would the Government not accept those very reasonable amendments when practically every witness, perhaps with the exception of the now Tasmanian Opposition, supported them?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, I read the Committee report. The union leaders came along and supported what the Opposition was putting before the Committee, and the industry came along and supported it. Even APPM said that it would support it, although it will live with the Bill in any event. It understood the merit of the amendments that were being put. Why was the Government not prepared to act reasonably in that regard? Unless it is as I suspect&mdash;and I put this some little time ago&mdash;that really the Government does not want the Bill to pass but wants to be able to blame us for it, I cannot see any logical reason for the position that it has taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the start we have said that we want the Bill; we are prepared to compromise; but we are not prepared to vote for a fundamentally flawed piece of legislation. We want the Government to come to the party, as it is prepared to do in so many instances in this chamber, through the Committee process, which facilitates the development of a piece of legislation that is basically satisfactory. Why is this Bill an exception? Why does it have to be dealt with differently if there is not an element of political expediency?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even so, when the Government refused the amendments that had been worked up professionally for the Committee&mdash;and which I would have thought met any reasonable standard&mdash;we still went out searching for a compromise that would allow us to get the Bill into a reasonably satisfactory form that we could support. As a result of discussions, a whole series of appointments were set up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the first Monday back here after Easter the industry came to Canberra to talk to Minister Griffiths, as did APPM and the Tasmanian Government. The Minister at last said that he was prepared to talk to us about the matter. We on this side of the chamber were saying that, with all that goodwill, there must be a way to put this Bill in a satisfactory form that both sides of the chamber can support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the Government saying that it was not prepared to legislate for regional plans, the breakthrough seemed to come with the letter from NAFI&mdash;the National Association of Forest Industries Ltd&mdash;to the Minister dated 23 April 1992. It put two alternatives. One alternative was the amendments that had been put in the Standing Committee, which the Government said it would not accept. It put the other alternative in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">request the Government to retitle the Bill for major forest projects and agree to pursue resource security for the rest of the industry in the context of the RAC recommendations&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I remind the Senate that the RAC had by that time put down its report, which also supported the Opposition's and the industry's amendments put before the Committee&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and the National Forest Strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In other words, the Bill would become major projects legislation. Government would be requested to agree to continue negotiations with the industry on resource security on the basis of regional assessments backed by legislation in the context of developing the National Forest Strategy.</PARA>
<PARA>NAFI was saying to the Government, `If you will not agree to legislate for the regional plans, at least agree to pursue the negotiating process that ultimately will give protection for regional development plans and, therefore, for the small players within the industry'. NAFI said, `If you are not prepared to legislate, let us accept this Bill as project specific, make it a little more certain in that regard, but agree to the regional plan in accordance with your own developing national forest strategy', which is the Government's strategy in accordance with its RAC committee. How would that be unreasonable? As has been said, Minister Griffiths accepted that that was a reasonable compromise which would allow both sides of the chamber to vote for a package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of that, the relevant spokesmen got together to fill out the package and put it in a form that could become an agreement. That is the form of agreement that Mr Griffiths was prepared to stand by and the one by which the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, ultimately pulled the rug from under his feet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is that agreement? As has been said earlier tonight, it is in five parts. Basically, there are three parts of substance. The first is to change the title of the Bill so that it is more specifically project orientated. There was no problem with that. The next two parts of that agreement, parts three and four, flesh out this concept of proceeding with negotiations to develop regional plans. It was put in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">agree to consult with industry concerning the development of the concept of enhanced inter-governmental agreements designed to provide resource security on a regional basis for those forestry industry investments which would not otherwise qualify under the Forest Conservation and Major Projects legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>What could be unreasonable about that? The plan was to agree to consult with industry concerning the development of the concept of enhanced intergovernmental agreements designed to provide resource security on a regional basis for forest industries that will not come within that Bill. How could anyone knock that? How could one argue against that? Secondly, it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">agree to ongoing discussions with industry and trade unions regarding the provision of certainty and security for investment related wood supplies in the context of reviewing ESD, National Plantations Advisory Committee and RAC recommendations prior to developing the National Forest Strategy.</PARA>
<PARA>So it will negotiate with these very relevant bodies in the development of this strategy. How could that be unreasonable? That is really the nub of what this Government has now reneged upon. The other parts of the agreement involve undertaking to continue to review its effectiveness. The Government has already said it is prepared to do that&mdash;it said it in here again tonight&mdash;and, lastly, to announce these commitments, which is an incidental matter that follows. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apparently, the Government is really bucking at the two clauses in this agreement that would require it to continue to negotiate on regional plans consistent with its own forestry strategies and to take into account the views of the relevant industries. How could this Government object to, and refuse, that part of this agreement? Basically, Mr Keating pulled the rug from under the Minister in relation to that part. It does not make any sense at all&mdash;unless the Government does not want a fair compromise but simply wants the Bill to fail and to be able to blame us. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has decided once again to gag a most important piece of legislation. I do not know whether the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate), who represents Tasmania, agrees with this. I have no idea, because he has not spoken at all in this debate. I would be most interested if the Minister was to get to his feet this morning and say whether he believed that this legislation that is so important to his State ought to be gagged and whether the gagged debate ought to be for 90 minutes. We have not started the committee stage yet; we have not even passed clause 1. I would be most interested if the Minister, instead of just reading the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> throughout this important debate, were to get up and say whether he believed that his Government should gag this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He knows how important this legislation is to our State. He knows that the whole of the north-west coast is relying on the building of a pulp mill in that area. He knows that his Government, through the recession we `had to have' which was engineered by his Government, has done disastrous things to the north-west coast. He knows also that Senator Richardson, just for a handful of votes from the greenies' preferences, destroyed the chance of a pulp mill on the north-west coast when the proposal was first put up. But we do not hear one word about resource security from the Minister, who is the only Minister representing Tasmania. That cannot help making every Tasmanian wonder why, because surely he has an interest in the subject. As I have already said, I would be interested in his views. I wonder whether we will hear from the Minister tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also wonder whether Senator Devereux will come in here and say that he believes 90 minutes is plenty of time to debate this piece of legislation in Committee stage when the Opposition has 17 amendments. We have read a lot about Senator Devereux back home deciding that the Left of the Labor Party and the Greens ought to be closer together. We have heard a lot back home about his reinstating the feeling between the Left and the greenies and his remarks that they should get together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely Senator Devereux wants more than 90 minutes to debate this Bill in the Committee stage because he did not say one word during the second reading stage of the debate, nor did Senator Tate. So surely those two Tasmanians will want more than 90 minutes to voice their views. Senator Sherry at least had the decency to stand up here and put his views. He has agreed with us that the legislation is not perfect. He said publicly that he believes the Government ought to get together with the Opposition and pass the Bill through this place. It will take more than 90 minutes to do that. </PARA>

Quite frankly, there is Buckley's chance of that happening&mdash;in other words, no chance. Why is it that we are being given only 90 minutes to pass the Bill?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Field, the Leader of the Opposition in Tasmania, made it very clear in the evidence he gave to the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs that the Bill cannot go back to Caucus because the whole thing is a factional debate. It is a factional problem for the Labor Party&mdash;nothing more, nothing less. Mr Field said that the Left has always been opposed to this legislation and some of the Right are now becoming divided on it. So the Government will not be willing to take the Opposition amendments back to Caucus, and  he told us we could be assured that it was nothing more than a factional fight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What a tragedy it is that, because of a factional fight in the Labor Party, we are allowed only 90 minutes. We have 90 minutes in which the Government can change its mind and give Tasmania a mill that it desperately needs. It is a mill that the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, who now sits at the table, knows our State desperately needs. I do not believe that 90 minutes is long enough to debate a Bill such as this&mdash;not when there are 17 amendments to be put by us alone. The Government has its own amendment and that will probably be the first one to come up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are not permitted to debate in this place in a reasonable fashion the legislation that is presently before us that so vitally concerns investment in this country, then do not tell me that we are living in a democracy. I say that this is true Labor Party democracy. How many times have I spoken about the particular brand of democracy that the Labor Party has&mdash;the show and tell brand? Labor Party members when they vote do not trust each other, so they have to show their own faction which way they have voted. That is exactly what is occurring in this legislation. The factional deals are ruining a perfectly good piece of investment that APPM tells us it wants. I object very strongly to yet another guillotine being placed on legislation that I consider so important. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The imposition of a 90-minute debate for the committee stage of this legislation is absolutely ridiculous. Many issues that have been raised so far in the discussion have highlighted this fact.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Probably the best speech that has been made so far this evening on this issue has been by Senator Harradine, who brought out many salient points with regard to the necessity for a comprehensive, ungagged debate, and the fact that we have to come in here and be subjected to the gag by the Australian Democrats and the Australian Labor Party, which have obviously different motives and different reasons as to why they suddenly want to constrain the debate completely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has come to our attention that what is going on is just political football because of the deals that are being done outside this Parliament between the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), Mrs Kelly, Mr Toyne, Senator Richardson, the Greens and all the rest of them. It is just the ALP playing its usual games of cheap politics and trying to predict and control what is going on at all times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cook, who represents the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) in this chamber, came in here this evening and foreshadowed the amendment he proposes to clause 1, which we have not yet debated fully. It is very interesting that in the debate in this place this evening, when we started to talk about clause 1, Senator Cook took the lead. He was quickly followed by Senator Coulter. We then went through the charade of formal motions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the shadow Minister responsible for primary industry legislation in this chamber, with a proper stance and policy view to put and response to make to the amendment proposed by Senator Cook, I was not given the same opportunity to participate in the full debate in the proper way before the gag was put, because of the torpedoing tactic of the Labor Party to come in and score points and get even and constrain the debate in whichever way it wanted to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay credit to the Resources Minister, Mr Griffiths, who obviously wanted to negotiate a proper agreement a week or so ago. He was approaching the Opposition, the industry groups and everyone else with substance. But what have we seen? The usual tawdry party-political Labor Party politics that this Prime Minister is so intent on carrying out. It is not back to the genuine issues of resource security, of jobs for Australians throughout Australia and, in particular, the project rich areas that ought to be sustained by this legislation. We have gone through a comprehensive series of stages in attempting to get good legislation on the books. Now this Government wants to deal with it in 90 minutes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were two sets of amendments. This debate, on clause 1 and the title, is linked only to the issue of the agreements that we wanted put in place and that Minister Griffiths agreed to give. That was a narrowing of the options in order to achieve the success of the appropriate way of getting, in particular, a project in northern Tasmania off the ground. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We presented a broader option in the second reading debate and canvassed it, with the circulation of a series of 17 amendments. If the Government was not going to go down the track that Minister Griffiths intended to take it, there would need to be full consideration of the 17 amendments. In 90 minutes tonight there is no way this Senate can give due and proper regard to those 17 amendments, which are so fundamental and will require particular attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope you noted, Mr Chairman, that when Senator Cook started his comments tonight he said, `I'll be prepared to go along with a certain commitment, with a certain statement'. It was similar to what Minister Griffiths said in the House of Representatives on 30 April last week. He said, `I'll say this and I'll say that and then I'll incorporate it in the third reading stage of the Bill where it can be properly facilitated and the Acts Interpretation Act can interpret that'. In a very cheap and nasty little dig, Senator Cook went on to say, `If I don't get the opportunity in the third reading speech'. That was before he even came in with any of these formal motions to bastardise this legislation in this place this evening. He already intended to put on the table this proposal to cut off the debate and bring in the 90-minute time limit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then Senator Cook played the cheap tactic of trying to put an industry organisation, NAFI, on the record with a letter of 18 February&mdash;before this chamber sent off the 17 circulated amendments to the Senate Standing Committee for proper consideration. We have to give regard to the Senate Standing Committee's report and we should give full regard to the dissenting report to that very important report. It was really carried on party political lines. The vote was three-all and the casting vote of the Chairman took it out. We do need to look at that report again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, in this place tonight Senator Cook resorted to a letter that was part of earlier considerations on 18 February. He did not refer to the letter that Senator Hill mentioned in this debate&mdash;the letter of 23 April from NAFI&mdash;which went into a whole range of things. It was a letter to the Minister, Mr Griffiths, on that particular date setting out a new track. What about the press statement of NAFI?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason that we have this problem tonight is twofold. Senator Button, acting under the most extraordinary arrangements or instructions that we could imagine, picked today to open up a wide and hairy debate on pecuniary interests in a rough and rambling way, as such debates are always conducted, and as he knows they always have been. He then proceeded to wonder why it did not go according to his little plan, which was to have about one speaker and then conclude it&mdash;again in good Labor Party form. But all it really showed was that it was more important to get up another of these sideline issues, distraction issues, so that we can fly this pink flag with bananas or something like that on it, I suppose. Some sort of a crazy flag is exactly the same thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because we went on with that for some considerable time, we now have the guillotine applied to important business.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know why it is that the Government members seem to be satisfied with their restrictions on discussions on matters such as this, but out there in the real world I think we will find that there are a lot of people who want a lot more discussion on the actions of the Government in this particular instance. It is a most extraordinary state of affairs, and I really fail to understand what it is that has the Government so determined not to even consider doing something that is sensible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The best summary that I have seen of the situation was probably the editorial in today's Burnie <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advocate</EMPHASIS>. This is the paper that covers the area which is primarily in the firing line when it comes to the pulp mill question. I will quote just two parts of it. One part says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bottom line is that although the Bill would pave the way for a Tasmanian pulp mill by guaranteeing North Broken Hill-Peko a wood supply, it is flawed. It is discriminatory. It does not protect the interests of the forest industry's smaller players, such as sawmills.</PARA>
<PARA>The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There needs, in effect, to be two bills&mdash;one for North Broken Hill and others in the same league and one for the smaller players. It will remain the hope of many pulp mill supporters in Tasmania that if the Forest Conservation and Development Bill collapses, North Broken Hill's plans will not come down with it. The chief executive of NBH subsidiary APPM, Mr Bill Paisley, has said that the Bill's defeat would not doom the mill so long as an alternative means of providing resource security took its place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the economic issues at stake, it is amazing that Federal resource security should have become such a battleground. But it's not as though the Bill's only critics exist in Opposition and Democrat ranks with political axes to grind. The forest industry also wants it improved. And the Resource Assessment Commission's forest and timber industry inquiry found it largely irrelevant to the industry, and recommended it be replaced by something better.</PARA>
<PARA>I offer the Government that piece of good advice from a very independent source. The article finishes by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the sake of all concerned, that is what should happen.</PARA>
<PARA>What should happen is that there should be a re-think on this matter. We cannot do that in 90 minutes. We have no hope of doing it in 90 minutes if we just batter it around, trying to get it through as fast as we can without the opportunity for proper debate. I am fortunate in having had the weekend to re-read much of the information that has come forward. There is not one redeeming feature about the legislation as it stands. There is not one thing that could not and should not be improved. I do not know who produced it, but if it was the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories, Mrs Kelly, it certainly does not do her any credit to say so. If she did not do it, then she should immediately discharge whoever it was that did do it. It is bad and it is ineffective.

He asked, `How can the Government refuse such reasonable amendments?'. As someone who has listened attentively to the entire debate, I have not heard the Opposition put even one of its amendments during the debate, yet Senator Hill insists that the Government has refused them. If the refusal of which he speaks simply applies to deals outside this chamber, he demonstrates how futile and cynical anything is that has been said or would be said in this chamber, and there is therefore no need to extend the time for debating it. That is my first reason for supporting the 90-minute time limit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Hill acknowledges any validity at all to committee discussion of each clause, and if he genuinely believes in the importance of the amendments, as he has so often emphasised, why does the Opposition not get on with it, present those amendments and speak to them?  Why has it not bothered to do so up to this time?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have strong feelings about this legislation. I am opposed to it and have expressed my views in my speech in the second reading debate. I was more than happy to continue debating it clause by clause, but there was nothing to debate. No attempt was made to utilise the Committee's time effectively. That is why I support a time limit.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating whether in the committee stage we should debate the amendments and all the other aspects of the Forest Conservation and Development Bill for 90 minutes or whether we should have a decent debate on it for longer than that, as we normally do in the chamber&mdash;a good, complete and thorough debate on the issues that are brought up in the course of a Bill being discussed in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier tonight Senator Cook said that we had had more than enough time to debate this Bill. I would ask Senator Cook or anyone else in this place whether we should debate things right through in a proper way, not just, as is the case now, for 90 minutes. Why could we not have proceeded with this Bill as we have proceeded with so many other Bills in this place? Why could we not have a good and proper debate in order to arrive at some decent legislation at the end of the day?  That has not come about at all. We are approaching the stage of a guillotine on this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are debating the credibility of the Government in the way it is trying to slam this Bill through tonight. It is about the credibility of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), and the credibility of all the evidence given to the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs.  We are asking everyone to throw all that credibility out the window just because the Government is scared that if this legislation is allowed to go to the Caucus tomorrow it may be overturned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us just look at the Prime Minister's credibility. Some time ago in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper Lenore Taylor made the point very clearly that Mr Keating, then the Treasurer, vehemently argued against the legislation at a Cabinet meeting. After he became Prime Minister, Mr Keating announced during the Tasmanian election campaign, where the State ALP supported the plan, that the previous Cabinet decision would stand. What sort of credibility does the Prime Minister have?  He has changed his mind a couple of times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should have been able to debate, for much longer than 90 minutes, whether that was right, whether it was wrong, and all the other facets of what it was about. The Prime Minister has been against the legislation;  he has been for it. However, I believe that his big mistake occurred when this legislation could have had the approval of everyone in this place, but when Mr Griffiths went to him he did not take the opportunity. Mr Keating was rolled by the left wing and by Minister Kelly. On that day as a Prime Minister he was left wanting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We still want to discuss and to debate in this place for longer than 90 minutes submissions that were made or evidence that was given by Robert Richardson, the Industrial Officer of the ACTU, who attended our inquiry as a witness. He also represented the Combined Forestry and Mining Employees Union. In giving evidence, Mr Richardson summed up the view of probably everyone on all sides of the debate when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now in terms of the legislation, the ACTU and unions are really appealing to both sides of this debate in the Parliament&mdash;the Opposition and the Government&mdash;to get together and get a result. The ACTU wants a Bill, an Act. We want resource security. We do not want it to die because of lack of negotiation between the parties.</PARA>
<PARA>The reason we want more than 90 minutes to debate this issue is exactly that. Here is the guy from the ACTU saying to the Government and to the Opposition, `Negotiate it through&mdash;let us try to get an agreement'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We did have an agreement. Minister Griffiths, having taken his thoughts to the Opposition and the industry, had an agreement. Then he took the agreement to the Prime Minister and it failed. Where have the negotiations failed? Unfortunately, the negotiations have failed at the Prime Minister's door. The Prime Minister is the one who is responsible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should have had longer to discuss and ram through this legislation&mdash;not just 90 minutes, maybe ending at three o'clock in the morning&mdash;which has far-reaching consequences not just for Tasmania. This legislation has far-reaching consequences for the timber industry in my State of New South Wales. It is not getting resource security because of this legislation. I would have liked to make more than just a little speech talking about whether we have 90 minutes to debate the matter; I would have liked a decent time in the committee stage to really bring those points home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the evidence of Mr Richardson was a letter which was included in the submissions. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I confirm that CFMIEU-ATAIU Division desires that the ACTU represents this organisation at the above enquiry on the basis that the existing legislation be amended to include:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) Resource Security based on regional forest management plans supported by value adding investment proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Resource compensation in the event of future resource withdrawal for conservation reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) enhanced inter-governmental agreement supported by legislation.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ASSISTANT FEDERAL SECRETARY</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CFMIEU/ATAIU DIVISION</PARA>
<PARA>Could we not have had a little bit of time, longer than 90 minutes, to discuss whether that is right or wrong? There are many other people in this chamber who have not had a chance to speak. Senator Harradine, I thought, summed it up beautifully. He has had one chance of 10 minutes to speak on this debate of a Bill that really affects his State. In fact it is a Bill that affects more than just his State, as I have just said, and he has not been given that chance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the Labor senators have tried to suggest that the industry was divided on the Bill, yet we pointed out in our report that even the APPM director, William Paisley, admitted to the Committee that the legislation did not go as far as his company would like. In fact, he said in answer to a question from me:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So we are really saying to people that even as it stands the legislation will be satisfactory for us, but we freely admit it does not suit the rest of the industry.</PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, it was project specific. Why could we not have a decent amount of time to debate whether it is project specific or not? We believe that it is project specific. If the Government had said, `We will make this legislation project specific', we could have come to some sort of arrangement. That was really what the Griffiths agreement was all about. I believe that the Government stands condemned for not debating this right through, for not giving it a fair airing. If it had taken two or three days to achieve good resource security legislation, this country would have been thankful to everyone in this chamber. As it is, this Labor Government stands condemned because it would not negotiate. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to oppose the guillotining of this Forest Conservation and Development Bill and the curtailing of the debate to 90 minutes, I want to deal with two aspects. The first point I make is the appropriateness of giving this Bill its full spectrum of debate. One has to make the point that this concept of a proposal for resource security is not something new; it has been around in public debate for years&mdash;at least five years and maybe longer. But it also raises the broader issue of when guillotines should be used. One has to first examine that to make a comment on this particular Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A guillotine should be used only in certain circumstances, one being where there is a security risk. One has to ask whether there is a security risk. The answer is no. Is there a natural disaster such as a cyclone, a flood, a bushfire or an earthquake? The answer to that is no. Are people's lives at risk? The answer to that is no. So we go on down the list. Will States' rights be protected by the position that is being adopted with the 90-minute restriction? The answer to that has to be no. Will the people who were involved in giving evidence to the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs have their interests protected by restricting the debate? Will their interests be given a proper airing and proper consideration? The answer to that is no. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth looking at the evidence and the information that was given to us on pages 71, 72 and 73 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> where there were some 17 organisations listed on a document which I incorporated. It is very instructive to see what was said by organisations from all States. I look at the Victorian Forest Industries Association's letter to Mr Griffiths where it wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . strongly support a regional approach to the legislation. . . I find it distressing that it has not been possible, so far, to negotiate what seem to be fairly straight forward amendments that would satisfy all industry sectors and gain unanimous industry support.</PARA>
<PARA>Will their considerations be taken into account by applying the guillotine? The answer is no. The Western Australian Forest Industries Federation wrote to Premier Lawrence. The document stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The letter to the Premier says that without the amendments the legislation does not offer long term security or the confidence for industry to invest in projects throughout the south west.</PARA>
<PARA>I am referring here to my own State. Will applying the guillotine protect its interests and allow its position to be debated in this chamber? The answer is no. We then move to the Forest Protection Society of New South Wales. The document stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's . . . tree plantation owners today joined calls for the Federal Government to adopt proposed amendments to its resource security legislation as a matter of urgency.</PARA>
<PARA>Will its point of view be debated properly in this chamber, and will its interests be put in the 17 amendments? The answer is no. We go on and look at what the Queensland Timber Boards Public Affairs Manager, Christine Bongers, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Federal Government's Forest Conservation and Development Bill 1991 was woefully inadequate.</PARA>
<PARA>Will its interests be taken into account? Will its interests be debated in this place? The answer is no. We then look at the Forest Protection Society of Western Australia&mdash;my State again&mdash;and it said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The CALM/AHC agreement on forests will be strongly opposed if industry amendments are not included in Resource Security Legislation to be debated in the Federal Senate tomorrow.</PARA>
<PARA>Will its interests be taken into account? Will its position be debated? The answer is no. One can continue going through these. We look at some of the organisations that are directly involved. Ford Timber stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ford Timbers, today urged Federal Parliament to approve amendments to its controversial Resource Security Legislation to ensure that the future of the forest industry is secure.</PARA>
<PARA>Hardys Tumbarumba said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Hardys urge all sides of Federal Parliament to adopt the industry/Union amendments to the Federal Resources Security Legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>Will the interests of Hardys and Ford Timber be considered? Will they be properly debated? The answer is no. It is worth noting what Hardys had to say there. It urged `all sides of Federal Parliament'. We on this side of the chamber have said that we will take into consideration its point of view. We are prepared to support its particular position. If we go through the document, we see the various organisations, including the union movement&mdash;particularly Bob Richardson of the ACTU and the associated unions&mdash;involved which gave authority to Mr Richardson to represent them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As one goes through this piece of legislation and, first of all, looks at the criteria of where the guillotine should be used, one sees that this legislation certainly does not fit into that criteria. It is not an issue of security, national disaster or the types of things that one would think the Federal Parliament would class as absolutely essential to be dealt with on the minute. That is not what this is about. Debate and consideration should be about looking at all aspects of the arguments put forward, the evidence given and the positions of the various people in the forestry industry. Because of this 90-minute restriction, consideration will not be given to these organisations' points of view, and there are 17 of them in the three pages of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One has to ask the question: what is the motive behind the Government's move to guillotine this legislation? Its motive is quite clear. The Government's motive is to protect the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating) from having to face a Caucus revolt and face up to the things that Senator Sherry raised today at the lunchtime meeting. It is about the man who stabbed Mr Hawke in the back. If the matter has to go back to Caucus, Caucus will debate it and, despite what has been said in this place tonight, the matter will be raised if it is not dealt with tonight. Of course, that will put people like Senator Richardson on very shaky ground, because he is the person who engineered the stabbing of Mr Hawke in the back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One must comment on the support given by the Democrats to this legislation. Senator Harradine summed it up precisely when he said that this legislation was doomed tonight. It is most improper of this chamber to restrict debate on a piece of legislation which has been around for so long and has had so much public debate. However, when it comes to the crunch, the Government does not want to have all the arguments and positions put regarding the 17 amendments that the Opposition wants to put before this place. That shame will be on its head for a long time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One cannot help wondering why the Democrats and the Left of the Labor Party do not get together and sit alongside one another. They are the real culprits in this debate. They are the ones who will doom it to failure and will stop proper resource security legislation in my State. I shall continue to remind the electors in Western Australia what they did and how they got in the way of the development of proper resource security legislation for the forest industries in Western Australia and the rest of Australia. My concern is for Western Australia in particular, and I will continue to put what they have done on the public record. It was the Government's stated intention that it would not support a sensible, rational, reasonable position as put by the people in the industry, and it also has put at risk the future of the AHC-CALM agreement which has been agreed to in Western Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is important that we return to addressing the major issue as raised in clause 1 of the Forest Conservation and Development Bill 1991. The Opposition has consistently said that this legislation is fundamentally flawed, as a number of my colleagues have adequately demonstrated, in the process of this Senate in referring the matter to the Senate Standing Committee, where the evidence was overwhelmingly consistent with out view. In particular, I would refer the Government and the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) to the evidence given to the Standing Committee by the ACTU and the importance that the unions placed on the need for necessary amendment to the legislation. It is, therefore, hypocritical of the Government to come in here and argue at this stage that it cannot agree to those amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal and National parties have offered to work with the Government and industry to produce a Bill which would give genuine resource security to the whole industry. This offer was never taken up by the Government. We then worked with industry to produce detailed amendments which provided for regional forest plans on a basis which protected environmental and all industry interests. We then had a Senate inquiry at which industry and union witnesses agreed that the legislation would be improved by our amendments. The Government has refused to entertain these amendments, despite support from industry and the trade union movement, as well as the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then took up in good faith a belated offer of discussions with the Government. The Minister for Resources offered the Opposition an amendment to the title of the Act, in similar terms to that which Senator Cook has presented here this evening,  to  demonstrate</PARA>
<PARA>that it applied only to large projects in the context of undertakings from the Government as follows&mdash;and there are the important principles that need to be committed and fully endorsed by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first principle is an agreement to retitle the Bill the Forest Conservation and Major Projects Bill, and all provisions of the Bill would remain unchanged. The second principle is to undertake, monitor and review the effectiveness of the legislation to ensure that it achieves its objectives of certainty and security for the industry and generates value adding investment and jobs in the forest industries. If it can be demonstrated that the legislation has not achieved its objectives within a reasonable timeframe, the Government would, in consultation with industry, consider what action might be appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third principle is to agree to consult industry and trade unions concerning the development of the concept of enhanced intergovernmental agreements designed to provide resource security on a regional basis for those forest industry investments which would not otherwise qualify under the forest conservation and major projects legislation. The fourth principle is to agree to ongoing discussions with industry and trade unions regarding the provision of certainty and security for investment related wood supplies in the context of reviewing ecologically sustainable development, national plantations advisory committee and RAC recommendations prior to developing the national forest strategy. The fifth principle is to announce these commitments in the resumption of the second reading debate in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) has introduced the retitling clause to the amendment but has not gone down the track of those five major agreements. The Minister referred to a statement by the Minister for Resources in the House of Representatives on 30 April. He picked up a few adjectives and phrases from those commitments but did not endorse them, did not fully accommodate them, did not recognise them, in a way which is satisfactory. Obviously, this is where the debate is now raging inside the Labor Party with respect to the commitment to those very important five principles that, importantly, the unions, the industry and anyone else connected with this legislation would want to see. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we know from the media and events of recent days, the Government has reneged on Minister Griffiths's offer and made it quite clear that its agenda is to see the legislation defeated on the combined vote of the Opposition and the Australian Democrats. The Opposition has consistently expressed its support for genuine resource security and for a pulp mill in northern Tasmania, based on the resource identified by the Tasmanian forest plan. It is quite clear that the Government is simply playing politics with the whole issue at a time when&mdash;as a number of speakers have already mentioned&mdash;one million people are unemployed. The Government's only object is to try to show that its failure to create employment, by promoting value adding in the timber industry, is the fault of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's having rejected our substantive amendments and having refused to give the undertakings offered by Alan Griffiths last week, the name change is meaningless. The Opposition is not interested in a cosmetic change. We have fought consistently for the 1,200 smaller saw mills around Australia. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made it clear in Question Time today that he would do nothing to provide resource security for small saw mills and projects involving less than $100m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When in government we will put in place genuine resource security legislation, based on approval of regional forest plans, which will provide resource security for large and small projects with the proper protection of both environmental and economic interests. I mention that the saga of events has been in the Senate, in the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs, and in the various negotiations between people. We had hoped that those discussions had taken place in good faith. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Stage 1 of those discussions was obviously when we proposed to look at genuine umbrella legislation. We put forward 17 amendments that would go down the track in broadening the legislation and making it project specific, but we did not accept the shoddy legislation that the Government has had the audacity to put before the Parliament. In stage 2 of those discussions&mdash;when certainly there was a degree of compromise, goodwill and discussion between Mr Lloyd, Mr Griffiths and the industry representatives&mdash;an agreement was written. It was established; it was put down. I mentioned earlier the five very important fundamental points that were essential to undertaking this particular area. In that sense, we were prepared, and we indicated that very clearly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, the Government is not serious. It has reached some sort of agreement with Mr Toyne and the ACF. Therefore, the issue unfortunately comes back to the internal politics within the Labor Party. It comes back time and again to why the Government is not prepared to give the undertakings and the full agreement that are so important to a company the name changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This whole debate, which now centres on clause 1, can be so simply accepted if the Government will give a commitment to endorse the full agreement that was struck between the Minister for Resources, Mr Griffiths; the National Association of Forest Industries; the Tasmanian Government; the Forest Industries Association of Tasmania; and the Forest Protection Society. That agreement, dated 28 April 1992, is what the Government has reneged on. That is the area where the Prime Minister and Mrs Kelly are obviously frightened, for political reasons, about moving and not backing up the proper and appropriate decisions. It is a challenge to this Government. I again throw that challenge to the Minister: give us that full agreement&mdash;that full commitment without equivocation, without amendment, without weaselling out of it, without trying to change it&mdash;and we will give you your amendment. Without that full and comprehensive agreement, there is no way that we can march down and accept. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many other areas that need to be put in place&mdash;areas of review for all of the smaller sawmillers, and work on better legislation. Certainly, in government, the Liberal and National parties would have an alternative proposal. We would have far better legislation in this specific area, but we have to live with the fact that the Government is only prepared to put on the table shoddy legislation, flawed legislation, dangerous legislation. There is an opportunity here for the Government on clause 1. We make our support for any amendment to clause 1 totally conditional. If the Minister cannot deliver in that particular area, it is a real pity for the industry. There will be other opportunities in the future, but it certainly compromises these major projects. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Without the agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is the Opposition's amendment on the first clause. We are dealing with the clauses seriatim, one after another, in the sequence in which they come up. This is the first one; it is clause 1. This is the amendment that Senator Tambling circulated in his name and foreshadowed, and we are moving it. The farce&mdash;the unbelievability of all of this&mdash;is that he is rejecting it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Tambling is rejecting this amendment after making, may I say with the greatest respect to him, a sanctimonious speech about why he is entitled to reject the Opposition's own amendment. All I can imagine is that somewhere in the infantile mind of someone who is advising him in all this lurks the sneaking suspicion that the Opposition can pursue what is frequently styled in political debate as the salami approach: take one slice off and pocket that; push a bit harder, take another slice; and slice and slice until one finally gets one's desired position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has said that it has a responsibility to give long and strong and clear and open signals about where it is going. We have made a movement towards the Opposition's position. The next expectation on anyone's behalf would be that it would make one towards ours. But, instead, it moves further away. Every time we come closer to the Opposition, it backs away further. The stridency and sanctimoniousness of its position heightens the further it backs away from us as we come towards it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A line has to be drawn somewhere. The line is that we have gone about as far as we can go. It is the sort of `everything is up to date in Kansas City' theme. We have gone about as far as we can go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is now a fundamental requirement on the Opposition to bend. I remind the Opposition that it really surpasses belief that it is dinkum. Senator Tambling could have said in three minutes that the Opposition was not going to accept our amendment and sat down. Then we could have all turned to the other 17 amendments that the Opposition wants to move. But he did not; Senator Tambling took all his time to make this sanctimonious speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Tambling were serious about the Senate dealing with the Opposition amendments and if he were serious about all the things that were said on his side a moment ago in the procedural debate as to whether 90 minutes was sufficient, he would have very quickly indicated his position, as is frequently done when we are all in a hurry to get through the committee stage of a Bill. We would have all flagged it, had a vote, determined that issue and gone on to the next matters. We could have had a longer debate about them than is now allowable because the Opposition has simply talked out time yet again. As I say, this must be a late hour of the day or an early hour of the morning because, if someone told me in the clear light of day that the Opposition was doing this, I would not have believed it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the Opposition has made a number of remarks, I am bound, as the obligation rests on me, to answer them. This argument is now getting about as tired as that old joke about people in prison calling out the numbers of jokes and everyone laughing. This was because all the jokes had been told so many times that everyone knew what numbers they all were and people did not have to tell a joke any more; they just called out its number. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter is getting about as tired as that. I can say, `I am now going to use arguments 8, 14 and 27 and I am going to add arguments 6, 3 and 4 into it as well'. Everyone has heard all the arguments. It has now got to this position in which we are simply recycling them and citing them back. There is no effort here to meet the argument; there is only an effort to try to bypass it and dodge the point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, in logical and sequential order, this amendment is the one the Opposition foreshadowed; we are dealing with this clause, and I have moved that amendment. The Opposition has foreshadowed that it will defeat it. What was the purpose in raising it in the first place? If the Opposition does not believe in it, why did it bother? Why did it bother to indicate that this was something that it wanted if it does not want us to pick it up?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Or is it that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in Question Time today actually exposed the Opposition? When he was asked about this&mdash;I have not read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>; I saw only a snatch of Question Time on television tonight&mdash;he said something like, `The funny thing about this is that we can actually amend the title to "major projects", but what the Opposition wants is all the minor projects'. If plain English is to mean anything, the title of a Bill ought to express what the Bill is about. The reason why we can move this title change is that the Bill is about major projects. If that accurately describes the Bill, this amendment should be carried. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition, however, does not want the Bill to be about these major projects, although it wants this title. It wants it to be about all the other projects as well. There is a complete answer to the question of the other projects which is a satisfactory, reasonable, moderate and convincing answer and is one that should be accepted by the Opposition. So with regard to the title, I simply say that it ought to express the type of Bill this is and name it accurately. This title does that. It is the Opposition's amendment in the first place, and those opposite should vote for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point is that in his speech Senator Tambling made the question of title dependent upon other assurances, which he read out. I have given the answer to that question before as well. I quoted a passage in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 30 April from the matter of public importance debate on the afternoon of last Thursday, during which the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) gave an undertaking to monitor, review and consult in the application of this legislation. He has said frequently what it means, what its purpose is and what it aims to do. He has said all of that and he has said, `I will monitor it to see whether it achieves this. If it doesn't, I will review it and I will consult with the various parties in that review to make sure that my objectives are met'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Tambling is saying that is not good enough. What is he calling Minister Griffiths, whom he has elevated&mdash;rightly, in my opinion&mdash;as a man of honour? And he is a man of honour. But the honourable senator cannot have it both ways; he cannot say out of one side of his mouth that the Minister is a man of honour, but out of the other say that he does not accept his assurances. The honourable senator cannot do both. Perhaps the Liberals can, I do not know; but normal people cannot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The position is that the Minister has given a satisfactory assurance that he will meet the issues that the honourable senator has raised. The difference is that he has given a blanket assurance, and the honourable senator wants to enumerate the issues. Is that the pedantic point upon which the fate of this legislation rests&mdash;that the Opposition does not like the way in which the subclauses are expressed? That is pretty much what the blanket assurance covers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us get some of these facts on the board again. The National Association of Forest Industries, which speaks on behalf of the industry, has said that it likes the legislation we have put forward. It has said in its note of 18 February that the legislation is not supported by NAFI in its current form as it will exclude most of the industry; but it then goes on to say, `However, members would not be opposed to its passage if this is a necessary step to establishment of a pulp mill in northern Tasmania'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been through this debate. We have the proponents of the pulp mill saying, `This is a necessary step'. We have now come to the crunch. There is no dodging this point; this is the point of decision. The proponents are saying that this Bill is necessary; NAFI is saying that if it is necessary in order to get the pulp mill up, we should vote for it. It speaks for the industry, but those opposite are proposing not to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is the situation of the State Government of Tasmania. It is not a government of my political stripe; it is a government of those opposite. It has made its position clear: it wants the legislation. Those opposite are voting against the interests of their own State Government. This is the States House; this is the chamber in which the interests of the States are held as being important. There has been a clear expression by the Leader of the Opposition in Tasmania and the Premier of Tasmania that they want this legislation. But Opposition senators, who have a clear responsibility to reflect their State interests, are voting against those interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is this a case of the Premier of Tasmania and the Leader of the Opposition in Tasmania being out of step with a handful of Tasmanian senators in this place? Is this a case of the Government and the Opposition of Tasmania&mdash;members of which actually live and work in the State all of the time&mdash;not knowing as much as those few senators who come to Canberra and spend only part of their time in the State of Tasmania? Someone is out of step, and it is not the State Government or the State Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is the question of the ACTU. I am frequently lectured in this place about the ACTU. I am told that I am its tool and its dupe. Senator Winston Crane, who is one of my major critics, is sitting there smiling in recognition of these words. I am now lectured, for the sake of argumentative convenience, that, essentially, I do not know what the ACTU position is. It just so happens that I do know what the ACTU position is; it supports this legislation. So honourable senators opposite should not insult my intelligence, the intelligence of the ACTU, and their own intelligence, by pretending that the ACTU's position is different from that. It is not; that is its position. The honourable senator knows that that is its position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we come to the proponent company. It made its position clear in last Thursday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS>, in which it said that it wants this legislation. The company made it clear that that was in its own interests and in the interests of the economic development of northern Tasmania. So that is a review of the formal organisations. What about those people who do not have a voice here directly through a formal organisation? What about the unemployed people in Tasmania? This is not an idle question. If this project goes ahead there will be job opportunities for them. Why do those opposite hate them? Why do they want to vote against them? Why do they want to deny them an opportunity for a livelihood? Why do they want to deny their families some sort of income? I put it to those opposite that they should reconsider in view of overwhelming public demand now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the further question. We can monitor, review and consult about the application of this legislation and we will do that. Through this legislation, we as a government are delivering our commitment to the industry. The industry will, however, flourish if because of what we do in this legislation the road is cleared to make it easier for the industry to make investment decisions. We are therefore in an informal partnership, in the sense that we are proposing to facilitate expeditiously the clearances of major projects dealing with sensitive environmental, ecological and Aboriginal concerns. We are proposing, at some political cost to us, to expedite those proceedings so that development can flow. I know, because the industry has told me, that there is some $5 billion in investment in this industry around Australia&mdash;not just in Tasmania, but elsewhere as well&mdash;that would flow at a critical time for the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I am going to put to those opposite is a very hard proposition because it is a proposition that does occur to the Machiavellian mind at a time like this. When there is no reasonable explanation for their behaviour, we look for other explanations. Is it the case that the Opposition wants to defeat this legislation to prevent that investment from flowing so that the unemployment figures and the economic outcomes are worse, in the expectation that somehow, if it can worsen the economic climate, prevent people from getting employment, we will be voted out of office? Is that the Opposition's real motive? If it is, please get up and be honest about it and get on to a constructive wavelength with us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the Opposition intends to move 17 amendments to this Bill. They all revolve around the single question of the $100m cut-off figure. We know from the industry's figures that if the $100m cut-off applied, something like 94 or 95 per cent of the projects in anticipation would be covered. We also know, through the proposal we have in this legislation to aggregate smaller projects, that in fact 99 per cent of proposed projects could go ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what the pedantry in this debate is about is the remaining one per cent and those projects can be covered by the enhanced inter-governmental agreements. Garry West, the National Party member and Minister responsible for natural resources in New South Wales is prepared to enter into an enhanced inter-governmental agreement with this Government. So that takes care of New South Wales, the soul mates of those opposite. But of course what the Opposition seems to be about is rejecting parties of its kith and kin in an effort to crawl over their economic interests and the interests of their own populations, to get at us, to crawl over them no matter what, just to get at us. I conclude that this amendment should be supported. I am astonished that the Opposition is not going to do so.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Senator Walters referred to him saying to them that, `He was sure he can deliver this', in reference to this agreement that is being flashed around by those opposite. As I understand, the Minister did not say that. In the conversations I have had with him he did not say, `Sure, he can deliver this'.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly do not believe that Senator Walters was there. I do not know how quotes from a Minister can be bandied around the Senate with such surety; it is just not correct. In reference to Senator Cook's position and the accusations made by Senator Walters, I share Senator Cook's position. I share Senator Cook's concern about the industrial dispute at APPM; indeed, the Liberal Premier of Tasmania shares that position. He in fact congratulated the union movement and in particular named the President of the ACTU, Mr Ferguson&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is from a Liberal Premier. He congratulated the union movement on its handling of the industrial dispute with APPM. It is good to see some commonsense from at least a small section of the Liberal Party in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In dealing with the evidence before the Committee&mdash;I was on the Committee; I sat through all of the hearings over three days&mdash;the first preference of NAFI, ACTU, APPM and the State Liberal Party as represented by Mr Evan Rolley and Mr Tony Rundle, the Minister for Forests, was for some amendments to this legislation. That was their first preference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was their next preferred position if those amendments were not carried? Their next preferred position was for this legislation to be passed. Why? In the case of Tasmania, Mr Rundle, the Minister, so competently outlined to the Committee that there was $1.673 billion worth of projects that would be covered by this legislation in its unamended form. In addition to that, the ACTU outlined that there was an integrated plantation project and a Maryvale project that would quite definitely be covered by this legislation. That is the reason why. If the amendments to this legislation are not carried, the fall-back position logically should be that the legislation is carried to accommodate those projects that were outlined before the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the position of the ACTU is to be commended. Since those hearings before the Committee in late March common law writs have been served on a number of trade union officials, including the President of the ACTU. I think the ACTU is to be congratulated for differentiating between the future of this industry in terms of investment and developing export potential and the industrial dispute it has with APPM. It is to be commended for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I deal with this issue of the threshold of $100m because, unfortunately, this issue displays the lack of knowledge that those opposite have on this issue of the nature of forestry and integrated projects. Firstly, the Government made it clear that this legislation would cover large scale or major projects; hence, we are very happy to acknowledge that in the amendment to the title. It is simply acknowledging what is a matter of fact. From day one, the Government has indicated that this legislation would cover major projects in excess of $100m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Government has always indicated that it is not interested in buying into disputes and evaluations of projects of a smaller size than $100m. That includes investment in mill projects of maybe $100,000 or $500,000 or $2m or whatever. It simply does not have the bureaucratic resources or the time to be running around the country evaluating hundreds of potential developments in the forest industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there is another important reason. Because of the integrated nature of the forest industry, there is an indirect guarantee to resource through the $100m developments&mdash;or greater developments&mdash;that are proposed. Should an area of resource  allocated to a new mill in Tasmania go ahead, a significant proportion of resource in that mill's catchment area presumably will be used for conversion of chips into pulp, and hopefully paper further downstream. A significant proportion of that resource that is logged and taken out of the catchment area will be too good because of its quality and its value to be chipped for pulp; it will be used for other purposes. The timber that is available will be able to be used by other operators in the industry. Hence, we have an indirect guarantee of a resource to other operators in Tasmania. That is the other reason why the Federal Government is not interested in removing the $100m threshold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government has tried its utmost with this legislation to ensure development of major projects, not just in northern Tasmania but in Western Australia and at Maryvale. In its One Nation package the Government has outlined a special depreciation regime of some 10 per cent to encourage development in this area. This Government is bending over backwards to ensure that major projects such as are proposed in northern Tasmania get off the ground; that the processing of our raw materials is downstreamed; that we reduce imports and become a net exporter of forestry products. We can do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is the Opposition getting so worried and so concerned? Members opposite have been making some fairly extreme attacks on the media during this debate. Senator Archer referred to the Tasmanian media as `the gutter press'. I note that we have a member of that alleged gutter press from the Hobart <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS> in the press gallery tonight. Given the situation in the past 15 or 20 years, it is interesting that for once in this debate on forestry members opposite are being held accountable for their position. They are a little worried because at the end of this debate they may&mdash;I hope they do not&mdash;vote with the Australian Democrats and the Greens to defeat this legislation. That is why they are so worried. They are getting a little desperate because they are being criticised in Tasmania for their position. Hence, we have the desperate and rather emotive abuse of the Tasmanian media. Those opposite cannot take it. That is the problem with the Liberal senators from Tasmania; they cannot take the criticism that is being handed out to them in the Tasmanian media. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cook has quoted from the editorial in last Friday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS>. There are a number of quotes here that refer to the Liberal senators from Tasmania:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In their intransigent adherence to a party line, Tasmania's Liberal senators are ignoring the needs of all the major players. . . . They were elected by Tasmanians. . . . If the mill plan falls through because resource security legislation is lost, the Tasmanian population should regard the Liberal senators as more culpable than the Greens. . . . They are to be tested on their commitment to the philosophy that the Liberal Party regards the Senate as the defender of the states against centralism, and they look like they will fail.</PARA>
<PARA>It is no wonder that the Liberal senators from Tasmania are getting more than a little worried. They are about to combine with their perceived arch enemies, the Greens/Independents, to defeat this legislation, just as they entered on that unprincipled course last year when they attempted to defeat the State resource security legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no wonder that the Opposition is getting a little worried or squeamish, and that is the reason why there is so much in the way of protest in this debate this evening. Why have those opposite locked themselves into an intractable opposition to this legislation? The reason is that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) was conned by a letter from the Montreal Bank which alleged that the resource security legislation currently before the Senate was worthless and totally unbankable. This view was rejected by the Australian Bankers Association, but unfortunately Dr Hewson rushed in and recommended that the shadow Cabinet oppose this legislation. I wonder how much consultation there was with Tasmanian members. The Opposition locked itself in, implacably opposing this legislation without giving the matter adequate thought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is like a number of other decisions made by Dr Hewson. He is not big enough to admit that he was wrong, that he made a mistake, and to change his position. We will have to wait and see how he gets himself out of the consumption tax, or the GST, if he ever manages to do so. That is the basic reason why the Opposition got locked into this position; it was conned by this bank letter. Now it is trying to back-pedal. Unfortunately, with the best efforts it can muster, that is simply not enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has adopted the words `major projects' in the legislation before us tonight. There is no harm in that, because it simply reiterates what the legislation is covering. Earlier in his remarks Senator Cook referred to the endorsement given by the Minister for Resources in respect of a number of processes that will be followed in the implementation of this legislation and Mr Griffiths outlined those processes in a speech during the MPI debate last week. That represents the position that the Government is willing to concede, which is a lot more than the Opposition is entitled to, given its performance in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before concluding, I reiterate that the evidence before the Committee&mdash;except that from those groups in the environment movement, such as the threatened species group, the Wilderness Society and the Conservation Foundation, which are implacably opposed to this legislation&mdash;was that the other industry organisations and people, including Mr Tony Rundle, the Liberal Minister for Forests in Tasmania, would certainly like some amendments. They do not necessarily want all the amendments put up by the Opposition. They were supporting some, but not necessarily all of them. However, at the end of the day, they wanted this legislation passed. If the amendments are defeated&mdash;and it appears almost certain that they will be defeated&mdash;the legislation should be supported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by quoting the Tasmanian Liberal Premier, Mr Groom, in reference to this legislation even if the amendments are not accepted. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I don't mind saying I want the coalition in Canberra to support the legislation. I think they are wrong in taking the stand they are taking. Obviously you need good arguments to reject that legislation if a pulp mill depends upon it.</PARA>
<PARA>That comes from none other than the Premier of Tasmania, Mr Groom. It is good advice, and those opposite should take it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I start, there are two matters I wish to raise with the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook). Firstly, I asked him for some answers to some questions, which do not seem to have come through yet; I wonder whether he is now in a position to answer those. Secondly, without stretching the friendship too far, perhaps we might have time to look at this exhaustive list of all the things that the Government has given, provided or done as far as the legislation is concerned. Those things seem to have escaped me and I just feel that it may be an opportune time to have a better look at that list.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is really quite important to ensure that we are all talking about one and the same thing. I will repeat the things that Mr Griffiths said in the other place, as it is quite clear that the Minister is not quite on the same wavelength with what he reads or believes that somebody has said. On page 2162 of the House of Representatives <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of Thursday 30 April 1992, Mr Griffiths also was trying to do a bit of what I suppose we would call `Keatingtalk' these days. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It seems to me to be an extraordinary position that we have now reached, where the Opposition will apparently vote against this legislation in the Senate as a response to the Government not being prepared at this point to change the title of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be a sin of omission on my part were I not also to say that there are differences in terms of the Opposition's desire to see the Government embrace, in a written instrument to itself, undertakings relating to the ongoing monitoring of the legislation and, in the event of the legislation being found wanting, indicating a preparedness to review within a reasonable time frame any shortcomings in the legislation. As a mirror image of that position, I might say the same thing in relation to enhanced inter-governmental agreement processes.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that both Mr Griffiths and Senator Cook were trying to give the impression that that was the same as the now well-known and well-recognised `Griffiths agreement'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Having achieved an agreement of this form, it seems quite extraordinary that Senator Cook and Mr Griffiths are now not prepared to say, `Yes, that is it'. That is what we are discussing. Mr Griffiths went on to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am quite happy to indicate in this chamber, on the record, that any legislation for which I have responsibility either as Minister for Resources or, for that matter, as Minister for Tourism would, in the normal course of events, be subject to such ongoing monitoring and review. There is no legislation for which I have responsibility that I would not review in the event of shortcomings being established. So if we have now a position&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and then there was a little bit of interjection. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So presumably that strips away the Opposition's requirement to have, by way of correspondence, the identical undertaking. The undertaking is there, as I indicated to the Opposition in our discussions&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I ask Minister Cook: with the record that the Labor Party has, does he really believe that anybody would take a verbal assurance&mdash;really, does he?  I would like him to think about that one because it may be a harder question to answer than the ones I have already given him. Even if it is in writing, I am not sure that I would really believe that I had it. I have a copy here of a document called the memorandum of understanding. It has some of the best autographs about on it too. It was one of these excellent agreements that we have been talking about. This is the way to stretch the wherewithal. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the chamber that this is an Opposition amendment&mdash;an amendment which the Government is moving in order that we might move on to the cherished other amendments that the Opposition proposed to have brought forward. Before we got into the substantive debate on this issue we had a procedural debate. In that debate there was a lot of bleating and complaining that members in this chamber do not have the opportunity to debate all the amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point for the record is that Opposition members have had an opportunity to do so but have not sought to debate any of their amendments. They have not sought to move them or bring them before the chamber and conduct a proper debate of their amendments. I do not know whether that means they are afraid of them, that they are not wedded to them, but the fact is that in this debate they have not bothered to move them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know what Opposition members think is the great parliamentary tactic in this procedure.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Somewhere the Opposition has to confront the following question. Why does it hate Tasmania; why does it hate development; and why does it hate people who are unemployed getting access to employment? The Opposition has to confront that question because pretty soon it will be casting a vote to determine where it stands. It can enable this project to go ahead; it can enable these jobs to be created; it can enable economic development to occur; it can enable the balance of trade to swing more in our favour; it can enable downstream processing to occur on the very valuable and ecologically and environmentally rare resource of forestry&mdash;it can enable all those things to occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, if the Opposition votes this legislation down, the investment will not flow because the security will not be there. The Opposition has this choice; this is its decision. The Government has strenuously been presenting the case to the Opposition and it should make the decision in the affirmative. I understand that the Opposition is locked in, it is blinkered, and it will not proceed to make this decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to some of the major arguments that those opposite have put. The first is the disgraceful, totally misrepresentative and disingenuous argument that the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) has somehow made an agreement. Senator Walters went to the extreme and actually quoted him. As far as I am aware, Senator Walters was not there. She does not have the power to read someone else's mind. Nonetheless, she maintains intransigently that these are the words he used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did Mr Griffiths do? He issued a document to the industry for exploratory discussions in order to open up the deadlock and get people talking again. When the outcome of these discussions had been concluded&mdash;it is on this point that those opposite always argue the contrary; I am here to tell them on behalf of the Government that this is the case&mdash;Mr Griffiths indicated that he would take the matter back to the Government and that it would respond. Mr Griffiths was not and did not seek to be in a position to conclude an agreement and nor did he. He referred the matter back to the Government and the Government, as a whole, responded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a lot of disingenuous praise of Mr Griffiths. I think praise is merited. He is a very good Minister and he far surpasses those on the other side who have discussed this matter with him. Mr Griffiths did not do what is claimed by the Opposition: he did not conclude an agreement. Those opposite may stand up and say, `He did! He did! He did! He did!', like some child hankering after a toy. Repetition does not change circumstances; the circumstances are that he did not conclude an agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the NAFI board. On 18 February, the NAFI board issued a statement saying that of course it would prefer some amendments to the legislation but, if not, `Members would not be opposed to its passage if this is a necessary step to establish a pulp mill in northern Tasmania'. We know that it is a necessary step; we know that the amendments are not going to carry. The industry organisation is saying, `Carry this Bill'. The Opposition is saying that that is not true. I understand that this was re-endorsed by the NAFI board again today. What might have been said between when it was carried and now cannot be used as the case for where it stands now. This has been re-endorsed today and those opposite are bound to listen to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point I refer to is the ACTU. This is a joke and I am sure it might make `Column 8' in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, or some other column, as some other peculiar expression of weirdness from the Opposition. At this hour of the night we would expect a bit of weirdness. The ACTU gave evidence, through Mr Bob Richardson, to the inquiry. What is the Opposition saying? It is saying that that is the ACTU's position. The ACTU is an organisation, like many other organisations&mdash;both union and industry organisations&mdash;which is dynamic. It does not have a static position; it is not a Maginot line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ACTU looks at circumstances which change, and changes to meet the changed circumstances. As I understand it, in the ACTU's view, the circumstances have changed and the President of the ACTU has told the Government today, not on his own behalf but as the official spokesman for the organisation, that it supports the passage of this legislation. The Opposition says that that is not true and that it does not believe it. We may not be standing here because those opposite do not want to believe it, but it can be proved by resort to simple items of proof in physics that we are here. Whether they believe it or not, we are here. Whether they believe it or not, the ACTU's position is to support this legislation. The Opposition should not use the ACTU, NAFI and North Broken Hill as crutches upon which to argue these fictitious arguments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That leads me to the Government of Tasmania. The Government of Tasmania won an election based on the development of pulp mills in Tasmania. It won an election on proposals to manage the forest there. It won a closely fought and bitter election in Tasmania. What does it say? It says that it wants this legislation. What does the Opposition in Tasmania say? It says that it wants this legislation. What do the two major parties representing the majority of electors in Tasmania, therefore, say?

This will cover all of those investors who want to spend $3m, $500,000 or some other figure less than $100m. They do not alter the major projects part of the Bill, which will cater for projects over $100m, but they do add resource security for all the small people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, amendment 17 is most important. This simply removes a very silly clause which says that, after giving resource security, the Government can take it away and not pay any compensation&mdash;not even timber replacement. Very early in discussions with the Government, Mr Griffiths said that he would remove this clause, but he was rolled on that matter too. So what sort of security is this?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our amendment 16, or new clause 22A, will provide timber to the investor if he loses the timber over which he has the resource security due to some unforeseen legislation. It is indeed regrettable that the Government has frustrated and thwarted the proper debates that should take place on these very comprehensive amendments. There are 17 of them in that area that I have had to precis. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we have argued this evening over and over again, a guillotine is a totally inappropriate way of dealing with such major legislation as this. It is vitally important that we get on with the proper business of this debate. It is obvious that in the future the only correction to this is going to come after the change of government, when appropriate legislation will be fully addressed by a Hewson-Fischer Government that will go down the tracks and give the commitments that, very obviously, industry is unable to achieve even in late conversations and discussions with the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had to face the shenanigans of a government that is in its dying and gasping stages, that will not give review to the appropriate pieces of legislation in its own Party forums and that will not properly accommodate the debates that happen within its own divisions or factions in whatever way we want to cover it.

We need to record that tonight has been a shameful attempt by the Labor Government to wheel and deal and to trade and carry on in so many areas. The casualties of this whole area are the hundreds of thousands of Australian people who have lost their jobs. The industry has been prepared to cooperate and the Opposition has been prepared to cooperate and negotiate, but factions and tiny leadership deals, particularly in vested groups within the parliamentary wing of the Labor Party, are what have caused the casualties and the problems on this occasion. </PARA>

I need to go back over what has happened. We have had a second reading debate, we have had an inquiry and we have now had 4 1/2 hours of debate on the committee stage of the Forest Conservation and Development Bill&mdash;and we still have not dealt with the first clause. I moved an amendment, which was the Opposition's amendment, to change the title of the Bill.

Not so long ago Senator Archer quoted the Resource Assessment Commission in this debate pointing out that the Commission said that this legislation was not necessary.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If my instructions are correct, I cannot understand why Senator Cook is taking the course of action that he is taking at the moment, thwarting the desire of the Minister for Resources and blocking the agreement that could lead to the construction of this mill.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;My advice is that there is no final form of agreement on which any such procedure can be based. Accordingly, we are proceeding unchanged. If it is the view of the Opposition that it is desirable that further attempts be made to reconcile what it sees as a narrow difference, the mechanism that is available, now that the Bill has been amended&mdash;it will, if passed here, have to go back to the House of Representatives&mdash;is for those opposite to vote for the third reading of the Bill. Then, if they wish for time to finalise the matter, the Bill has to go back to the House of Representatives and they, accordingly, will have that time.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"> With reference to the Suspect Illegal Entrant Vessel (SIEV) investigation:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Does the Government agree with the executive summary conclusion that "on this occasion they failed to detect a significant and sensitive target vessel illegally landing in Australia".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Why was there no independent evaluation of the operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) It has been said that the investigating team had no "direct involvement" in the evaluation, did they have any indirect involvement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Given the serious admissions in the report and the number of unanswered questions, will the Government have the report scrutinised by an independent group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) The summary claims that without clear intelligence "Coastwatch was forced into large area searches", is this conclusion correct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) Does the report demonstrate that wrong conclusions were drawn and that operations concentrated on approaches to Darwin and Broome, ignoring totally the Kimberley region where intruders eventually landed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) The report says that the bottom line is "better intelligence and the wider use of risk analysis techniques", what exactly does this mean.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) What agencies are presently involved in intelligence gathering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) Who is to be involved in new risk techniques.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(10) Why were there little or no serious long term considerations given to a deliberate landing and entry into the Kimberley region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(11) It has been said that "there is no basis for any suggestion that Coastwatch (from either Broome or Darwin) reduced flying rates as a result of Christmas or the New Year period", does the report admit that despite the patterns of previous years, where there is a high activity of Indonesian fishing boats over the December and January periods, that the operation was not mounted until 31 December 1991; if so, why was the high risk Christmas period ignored.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(12) Why was the Coastwatch aircraft, seen by some on the vessel on 31 December 1991, not briefed about the possible SIEV arrival: (a) does this indicate a lack of co-ordination; or (b) laxity in preparing and distribution intelligence for pilot briefing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(13) Were other aircraft operating on routine patrols briefed on the possible arrival; if not, why not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(14) It has been admitted that in regard to inter-agency communication "liaison and co-operation arrangements could be even better structured and streamlined": (a) what are the revealed weaknesses that led to this conclusion; (b) why is the planning process flawed; and (c) what disciplines are needed to "ensure all possible scenarios are considered".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(15) Is it true that after the landing neither the vessel nor the landing parties were detected until the arrivals contacted the King Edward River Station, a period up to almost two weeks after the vessel sailed into Montague Sound.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(16) Why are there no contingency plans in place to deal with landings such as this and why are police and other such agencies not presently involved in contingency planning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(17) Was NORFORCE ever alerted or used in the land search.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(18) Are the reports of routine NORFORCE patrol activity available to, and used by, Coastwatch, police, customs and other agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(19)(a) Were Customs, RAAF or Naval resources used in relation to, or even briefed, about, the possible landing; and (b) were any of these resources deployed during the December or January periods; if not, why not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(20) Despite knowledge that the vessel had reached Sumba, why did intelligence fail to provide ongoing information about the vessel, its replacements, its crew and passengers and does this indicate a specific failure in this case or does it demonstrate a gap in our strategic intelligence capability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(21) The report comments on the limitations of the aircraft and equipment used by Coastwatch: (a) are these assets good enough to achieve the objectives of the organisation; (b) are there better assets available; if so, why are they not being used or acquired.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(22) It has been revealed that agencies believe that it is likely that arrivals will increase and "the potential impact of an exotic pest or disease incursion to Australia could be enormous", it is also revealed that one tactical operation of about five days "means complete disruption of Coastwatch services around the country": (a) does this indicate that one planned or unplanned "incident" could allow other arrivals to land without detection; and (b) what action is proposed to correct this dangerous lack of resources in aircraft, training pilots and observers, and finance.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) A small team from Coastwatch and the two policy agencies was appropriate to identify what happened and to recommend changes for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The Investigation Team members were directly involved in the evaluation but not in the SIEV incident. Neither did they have any involvement in the pre search stage though two of the members were briefed on developments whilst they were on leave. All three members had a management/supervisory role of their respective officers during the search. None of the officers had any involvement, direct or indirect, in any aspects of the pre-search or search stages which subsequently was the subject of the Report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Not necessary as all recommendations will be implemented and all findings were addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) Yes wrong conclusions were drawn though it is incorrect to say the Kimberley region was totally ignored.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) With good clear intelligence on specific targets and sound definition of high risk areas Coastwatch is able to deploy aircraft and surface craft in support in those areas with the highest probability of detecting intruders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) Australian Customs Service, Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Department of Defence all provide Coastwatch with information which is used to plan flights. Information from the general public and media sources is also used for this purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) In the context of Coastwatch, all client agencies which provide taskings undertake some form of risk analysis and assessment as does Coastwatch when determining competing priorities for surveillance services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(10) The area was previously designated low risk for landing/entry by Coastwatch and relevant client agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(11) No. Operations against possible illegal fishing had been planned months in advance and were well under way from both Broome and Darwin before any decision was taken to address the possibility of a SIEV arrival. In terms of resource use the effect of both activities was to utilise aircraft to the maximum for the period 24 December 1991 - 9 January 1992 when the flying rate was reduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(12)(a) No</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) No</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time there was no clear evidence to suggest a SIEV vessel was likely to be in the area.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(22)(a) Not necessarily. The answer depends on a range of issues including the circumstances of the arrivals and other factors including aircraft serviceabilities, crew availability etc. For example a series of arrivals over a period of weeks would certainly stretch Coastwatch resources however this has been experienced previously when up to 15 foreign fishing vessels were successfully detected and apprehended in both northern and north western waters at no detriment to the overall Coastwatch mission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) The nature and level of threat to Australia by illegal entrant vessels is being closely monitored to ensure Coastwatch resources remain appropriate to meet that threat. Scope already exists to redeploy Coastwatch aircraft from other regions and to hire non-contract aircraft to carry Customs observers as the need dictates. Were it to be assessed that the threat from SIEV vessels was increasing further expansion and flexibility to Coastwatch capability would need to be considered by Government as the need is identified.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The National Food Authority was established on 19 August 1991 to develop and review food standards for uniform adoption throughout Australia by the States and Territories.  Its establishing legislation is the National Food Authority Act 1991. In developing and reviewing food standards, section 10 of the Act requires the Authority to have regard to the following objectives in descending priority order:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the promotion of consistency between domestic and international food standards where these are at variance providing it does not lower the Australian standard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The protection of public health and safety is the primary objective of the Authority in developing food standards. In working towards consistency between Australian and international standards, Australian standards are not to be lowered. Harmonisation of Australian standards with international standards is an important objective for the Authority in terms of Australia's obligations under the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, to which Australia is a signatory, and the decision by signatories to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade on the application of sanitary and phytosanitary measures. In the case of food the relevant international standards are those developed by the Codex Alimentarius Commission. Under these agreements, countries can diverge from Codex standards where they can justify doing so on health or safety grounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia will not lift the moratorium on food irradiation until the Government is fully satisfied that the process is completely safe.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's questions:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Australian veterans who participated in the Tests Program in Australia (or their widows) who have an injury or illness which they believe resulted from participation in that program are entitled to apply for compensation under the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988. Compensation availability is not restricted to cancer conditions, but can cover any injury or illness. Claims are assessed by the Commission for the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation of Commonwealth Employees (COMCARE). Following the Royal Commission into British Nuclear Tests in Australia, the Government extended eligibility for compensation to non-Commonwealth employees involved in the Tests Program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the Government announced on 4 September 1989 a special administrative scheme to allow payment of compensation to those Australian participants in the British Nuclear Tests Program who have (or have died from) multiple myeloma or leukaemia (other then chronic lymphatic leukaemia). Under the Scheme compensation is also payable to the dependants of any Test participant who has died from the above two diseases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All existing common law actions against the Commonwealth were lodged in 1988 and 1989. Since 1989 the Commonwealth has consistently sought to have these matters resolved outside the Courts, not only through COMCARE and the special administrative scheme referred to above but through an Act of Grace payments scheme established in September 1989. The intention of the Act of Grace payments scheme was for eligible cases to be assessed on their merits outside the adversarial Court system with a decision being taken jointly by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and the Attorney-General. In most cases information has not been provided to enable the validity of the claims to be assessed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Commonwealth could have let these cases sit indefinitely in the High Court where they were lodged, it recognised the increasing difficulty of establishing the facts of each case so long after the event and sought to expedite consideration of the cases through the Federal Court. While the Commonwealth is defending these claims in the Federal Court it is still open to eligible claimants to have their cases considered under the Act of Grace payments scheme at no cost to themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Government does not accept that nuclear veterans remain unjustly uncompensated. While recognising that it can be difficult to establish that a cancer was probably caused by radiation and that an individual was exposed to radiation in the course of his employment (as required under the COMCARE Act), it is noted that at least one radiation related claim has been accepted by COMCARE against this criteria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While radiation exposure records do exist for Australians involved in the Tests, the majority of recorded doses are well below the safe dose recommended at the time by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is aware that radiation is just one of thousands of causes of cancer and does not accept automatically that just because someone has cancer and was involved in the Tests that there is a causal link between the two. Most of the claims against the Government are based on no more than assertion and it would be irresponsible of the Government if it did not seek to establish the merits of each case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The Government has already established the Special Administrative Scheme and the Act of Grace Payments scheme as a non-adversarial mechanism for addressing claims arising from the Tests. These schemes together with the compensation provisions under the COMCARE Act enable all claims to be assessed fairly and equitably outside the courts.</PARA>
