<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. I refer the Minister to today's March quarter national accounts figures, which show that private investment has collapsed to its lowest level in five years; our net foreign liabilities have jumped to almost $200 billion; exports of goods and services have slumped by almost 2 per cent; and overall growth was a negligible 0.6 per cent for the quarter. In light of these facts, and particularly the collapse in investment, does the Government still believe, if it ever did, that Australia will achieve the economic growth rate of 4 3/4 per cent forecast for 1992-93 in its `One Nation-One Job' statement?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The national accounts figures released today show that we have had three consecutive quarters of growth since the economy bottomed in the middle of last year. Those three quarters of growth amount to 1.5 per cent. These moderate growth figures are expected at the start of a recovery phase. As I said in a debate in the Senate last week, that was largely the pattern of behaviour in coming out of the previous recession, although this recession, of course, has been longer. I also made the point&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, there is an end in sight. If that is unpalatable to Senator Panizza, I am sorry about it, but there is an end in sight. Senator Short, of course, I think quite properly, concentrated on the investment side in particular, and the investment figures are disappointing, but they are not inconsistent with the change in the pattern of growth. Investment is always a lagged indicator, as is employment. Business investment will turn around in response to the pick-up in demand, helped by the One Nation statement measures and by the low interest rates and low inflation rate. It will also, of course, be helped by the rising corporate profits reported in the national accounts which confirm the corporate profit figures released by the ABS, I think, earlier this week.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government welcomes the publication of the national accounts figures. They do show that the economy has returned to growth, albeit slow growth. There are a number of indicators which suggest that that growth picture will improve and that the economy is well on the way to coming out of recession. In respect of investment, let me say again that the corporate profits picture, the interest rate and inflation figure all set the scene for what is normally a lagged performance indicator, that is, business investment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I note that the Minister has totally failed to answer my question, which asked whether the Government still believes that the 4.75 per cent growth rate for next year is achievable. Given his quite obvious refusal to endorse that fairies at the bottom of the garden growth rate forecast for next year, will he now come clean with the Senate and the Australian public and acknowledge that the unfunded spending proposals in the voodoo economics `One Nation-One Job' statement are even more unachievable than they were from the outset?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Although it has nothing to do directly with APPM, there are some interesting comparisons. Is the Minister aware of a workplace agreement developed at Kimberly-Clarke Mills based on wage increases in return for improvements in productivity? Can the Minister advise honourable senators whether this agreement is proof that the present industrial relations system can produce in terms of workplace productivity and cooperative employer-employee relationships all that its critics claim that it cannot do?</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The employees at Kimberly-Clarke's Lonsdale plant in South Australia&mdash;which is a high technology plant manufacturing a range of goods including, Senator Newman may be interested to know, disposable nappies&mdash;have now reached a workplace agreement. It is a good example of innovative workplace agreements being reached within the existing industrial relations system&mdash;a system that we will modify soon with the approval of the Senate to encourage further this type of agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Amalgamated Footwear and Textile Workers Union and the management of Kimberly-Clarke have cooperated in developing an agreement which provides for significant improvements in productivity at the Lonsdale plant. It arose out of close consultation and joint decision at all levels of the enterprise. It was praised by Deputy President Riordan of the Industrial Relations Commission when he described it as something exceptional and highly commendable and added, `I congratulate the parties to the agreement and hope that their cooperative attitude will last for their mutual benefit well into the future'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a high technology plant. It is a plant in which, under the terms of this agreement, there will be semi-autonomous work groups formed. They will be multi-skilled and they will operate the plant in close consultation with management over the managerial decisions which will ensure, we believe, a high quality output from the plant. There is a heavy emphasis on skill development, workers working as a team and ensuring that all workers in the team have the same level of skills. The agreement will provide for annualised salaries. It will incorporate an element that compensates for overtime and shift premiums and ensure that this plant&mdash;a 24-hour continuous shiftwork plant in which employees work in 12-hour shifts two days on and two nights on, then four days off&mdash;works very efficiently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The outcome of this agreement is that there will be a productivity jump at the Kimberly-Clarke plant. Management will be able to market its products competitively, here and overseas, in a way in which it will be able to secure and expand its position in the market. Its work force will have opportunities for greater skilling and better career prospects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an important development. It is a good demonstration of how our system of industrial relations works. Those sorts of agreements, unfortunately, would be put in jeopardy if the Opposition's industrial relations approach ever had a chance to gain root because the essential trust and confidence between management and workers this sort of agreement promotes would not be present in the Opposition's approach. Senator Aulich, in asking me this question, referred to APPM. All I can say about APPM is that that is a sneak preview of what the Opposition's industrial relations policies will produce in this country.</PARA>

<QUESTION PAGE="3225" SPEAKER="Baume Sen M.E." NAMEID="LE4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Why did the Government make export market development grants totalling half a million dollars over the 10 months to September 1990 to Mr Noel Ling, the proprietor of a number of English language educational institutions, mainly for Chinese students, that have since closed through bankruptcy? Is this the Mr Noel Ling who has not repaid any of his debts to the Commonwealth, which is currently suing him for $8m, arising from losses suffered by overseas students who were unable to obtain visas to Australia after paying their tuition fees and who, in March 1990, lent $281,979.95 to Mr Gregory Symons, who was also involved in a notorious education scam? Given that the Government was aware of the Chinese student education problem in early 1990, why was Mr Ling paid two export market development grants of $200,000 each in May and September 1990 while he was generating a huge loss to the Commonwealth, or are such considerations inappropriate when the Government is handing out export market development grants to the mates of mates?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3225" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am advised that three EMDG payments have been paid to Mr Ling, and this information has been given to the Opposition. One grant of $139,835 was for the 1987-88 grant year and that was paid in December 1989. The second grant of $200,000 was for the 1988-89 grant year and that was paid in May 1990. The third grant of $200,000 was for the 1989-90 grant year and that was paid in September 1990.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised that there is no documentation held in Austrade's EMDG files or, so far as I am aware, anywhere else in the Government system which suggests that Mr Ling had any contact or relationship with Mr Symons. I do not deny that there may have been some such relationship of the kind to which Senator Baume has adverted, but there is no documentation to that effect and I presume, as a result, no knowledge of any such relationship. One is, of course, constrained on giving specific information in any detailed fashion as to the nature of these grants and what they were for. I am able to say here, as elsewhere, some negative things about what they were not for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, I am advised that Mr Ling has never applied for, so far as Austrade records are concerned, or never received EMDG moneys relating to either the Marshall Islands or business migration schemes. As I have said on other occasions, business migration schemes are expressly excluded from the statutory definition in the schedule of the Act as to what constitutes an eligible service. I am also able to say, so far as Austrade documentation is concerned, that Austrade certainly had no representations made to it on Mr Ling's behalf by Senator Richardson or any other parliamentarian. Again, for what it is worth, the file discloses no reference at all to Senator Richardson. I make that as a negative statement, but that is true universally of all these matters in respect of which allegations have been made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Might I say something general about the EMDG system, because it is constantly misunderstood&mdash;whether wilfully or otherwise, I am not sure&mdash;how this system operates. It has been going as a statutory scheme since back in the mid-1970s. It is designed, of course, to assist businesses with their pre-export preparation for overseas market entry. The scheme is administered by Austrade and, as such, has been part of my departmental umbrella since November last year, and only since then.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are something like 2,000 claims annually&mdash;that is the expected number for this year, 1991-92&mdash;at a total cost of $134m. The scheme is essentially self-administering through sharply defined statutory criteria. Forms are submitted addressing the particular detailed questions which are spelt out in the documentation. There is an investigating officer who looks at each such application when it is made and tests the documentation against the criteria on his checklist. Where the documentation appears to be insufficient or inadequate, then that is followed up, often by a site visit to the business in question, if that is necessary to produce the result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we have said before, the criteria for the administration of this are not qualitative and not discretionary. They do not base themselves on any assessment of the viability of the business in question, nor do they make judgments about the quality of the particular export enterprise, whether relating to a service or a sale of goods in question. Payments are made after the event, not before, and are based on detailed documentation. There are statutory criteria limiting the amounts that can be paid and the number of times one can come back and dip at the well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have said before that the criteria and the system under which the legislation operates are not such as to lend themselves to representations, to manipulation, by even the most evil-minded perpetrator of such frauds upon the Commonwealth. It is a straightforward scheme that is largely self-administering and, to that extent, there really does not seem to be any foundation for any of the aura of smelliness or fishiness that, with the utmost respect, Mr President, the Opposition is trying to generate about this or any other payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has to be understood that this is the context in which this system operates when one is exploring&mdash;as I am quite happy to do now or in the debate afterwards this afternoon&mdash;any particular query that is made about any particular application. I am constrained by statutory criteria from being more explicit about what the money is actually spent for, but I am not constrained from uttering some negatives about what it was not spent for or applied for. I will be happy to do that in such a way as to get rid of most of the concerns that seem to have been expressed on this subject.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. The Opposition understands quite well the statutory requirements. What is intriguing in this situation is that the left hand of the Government&mdash;or should I say in this context the right wing of the Government&mdash;is owed money by someone and in fact is suing that person at this stage, while at the same time another wing of the Government is paying out money to him or her. I ask the Minister: are any checks made in this extraordinary organisation to ensure that that situation does not obtain and that the Commonwealth is not handing out money at the same time as it is suing someone for money? In view of the Government's decision to refund money to overseas students who have paid tuition fees to Australian institutions but who were subsequently unable to obtain visas to enter Australia, I ask: what proportion of the total amount outstanding that the Government has been unable to collect from people like Mr Ling is made up of Mr Ling and his associate organisations and what is the total outstanding?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Ray has answered the latter question for me. I will be happy to pass on the question to the appropriate Minister, but obviously I do not have the capacity to answer that. The problem is the way the way the EMDG Act is presently cast&mdash;and this was approved by the Opposition without, to my knowledge, any question or complaint about this particular statutory language. Section 12(2) of the EMDG Act deems:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where the Commission determines that a claimant has a grant entitlement, the Commission shall pay to the claimant a grant equal to the amount of the grant entitlement so determined.</PARA>
<PARA>So once a determination is made, Austrade is required by law to pay the grant to the individual concerned, the trustee, the receiver or the liquidator for the benefit of creditors, if that is the particular situation that is involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the statutory obligation. If there are any deficiencies in the statutory scheme, there is a reasonable opportunity to draw attention to those in the course of the debate on the legislation itself. As far as I am aware, Senator Baume has not taken advantage of that opportunity. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If he wants to draw attention to some perceived policy inadequacy, he is welcome to do so. He has done so. That is something that can be pursued and Mr Kerin has indicated a willingness to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said in this place, and as Mr Kerin has said publicly, the difficulty is that once the nature of the scheme is changed from being largely an automatically administered, self-administered system, the administration costs involved will be dramatically increased. Whether the trade-off is worth it in order to get the kind of satisfaction that members of the Opposition want about other current debts owed to the Commonwealth by the person in question, or from the point of view of any other of the criteria that is troubling them, is a matter for policy argument. It is not a matter on which the Government needs to feel in the slightest bit defensive, given the Opposition's embrace of this scheme which, in the past, has been total.</PARA>

As a result, a meeting was convened between the Department, Techway and a member of my staff. At that meeting, a variety of discussions were held as to how to assess Australian-New Zealand content in these computer contracts.

Subsequently, one of the officers involved in this process wrote a memo which disagreed with our decisions. His division head immediately made his view known that he did not agree with the memo. When it was sent to my office, my staff member also made it quite clear that we did not agree with the contents of that memo.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I refer to claims that Papua New Guinean troops killed hundreds of Bougainvillians in the Wakunai area during Independence Day celebrations on 18 May, including by the aerial strafing of villages using Australian Nomad aircraft, and to yesterday's denial by the PNG Government that any killings occurred. Given that the person who it is claimed broadcast the news of the alleged killings, Bishop John Zale, is a respected and prominent local figure, what steps has the Australian Government taken to independently check the allegations? In particular, can the Government ascertain whether an Aita village leader, Mr Kapuito, and his family were killed as is claimed? Given that the PNG Government and the BRA have proved to be unreliable witnesses in their public relations war, does the Government accept that independent sources of information about events on the island are essential?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of claims that have been carried by Radio Free Bougainville concerning a possible incident near Wakunai on 18 May. The PNG Defence Force has dismissed these allegations as a fabrication and villagers from the area who have been recently quoted in the Port Moresby<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Post Courier</EMPHASIS> have said that no such incident occurred. There is certainly no evidence to suggest that a Nomad aircraft was involved. Indeed, Radio Free Bougainville is alleged to have said that a PNGDF Arava aircraft circled Arawa on 31 May. In fact, a photograph accompanying the Port Moresby article portrays a machine gun being fired from an Arava aircraft, not a Nomad as reported. Papua New Guinea purchased these aircraft some years ago from Israel. These are straws in the wind. One is not able to give a definitive response to this, but at least in that respect the report is clearly inaccurate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no precise details on whether Mr Kapuito and his family were killed in the incident. Given the lack of substance in other claims made by Radio Free Bougainville on this and other occasions, I think one should approach that report with a great degree of caution until it is confirmed. It is the case that Radio Free Bougainville has been very active in making propaganda claims over the last few weeks.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At least so far as cereals are concerned&mdash;I know how fascinated Senator Walters is on the subject of cereal&mdash;the EC is moving away from delivering the bulk of its support by ripping off consumers through high domestic prices to now greater use of direct payments to farmers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we have to caution that this is not the millennium; the EC is continuing to provide absurdly high levels of support to its farmers. Where the EC is cutting prices&mdash;in particular, cereals, but also, to a lesser extent, beef&mdash;farmers are being largely compensated by way of direct payments. Still, the key issue is whether the way that support is being doled out will, in fact, lead to significantly lower levels of production. If it does, the reforms are worth while; if it does not, we have not achieved anything. The full details of how the programs will be applied are not yet available and it will also require quite a deal of economic analysis to estimate the likely market impact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With cereals, for larger farmers to obtain subsidies to compensate for lower prices, they will have to set aside under the scheme 15 per cent of their crop area. That will restrain production and it will have a positive effect on the market but no-one is yet in a position to say by how much. For beef, while there are some limits in terms of numbers of animals, to the direct subsidies that farmers will be paid, it is again not clear at this stage whether that will be effective in reducing production. For dairy, the production quota system is being maintained but substantial reductions in production will be required in the future to have a big impact on the world market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pressure on the EC, both bilaterally and through the Uruguay Round, especially from the US and the Cairns Group, has obviously been an important contributing factor in getting the EC to move on CAP reform, as is its own dawning realisation at last that the crippling cost of the CAP simply had to be dealt with. Australia made its own contribution to this process through, it will be recalled, the widespread distribution of the pamphlet <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Are you paying too much?</EMPHASIS>, which did have a quite significant press impact in Europe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An important positive element of the decisions, especially those on cereals, is that they do potentially open the way now for breaking the stalemate on agriculture in the Uruguay Round. The EC has been blocking the negotiations, particularly over the questions of how to treat domestic support arrangements and quantitative disciplines on export subsidies. Now that the EC has begun to move on this, our hope and expectation is that the Europeans will be able to show the flexibility that is required to accept an outcome to the agriculture negotiations, consistent at least with the principles of the Dunkel text tabled last year, which have been accepted by the Cairns Group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the current state of those negotiations, one is still poised uneasily between optimism and pessimism as to the current state of play. Further bilateral negotiations at ministerial level took place between the United States and the EC in Washington on 27 May. My understanding is that those negotiations were constructive in tone but further efforts will be needed before solutions to outstanding issues can be found. Flexibility from the EC is still the critical element required to bring these negotiations to a successful and early conclusion.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Senator Crowley must be referring to the $7.8m provided to Queensland under the Medicare incentives package very recently. Indeed, that package is a very important part of our strategy to ensure that Australian hospitals provide a very effective and efficient service to those who require care within them. It will be used in a manner highly compatible with the objective of providing that very good care. The sum of $2m will be used to increase the availability of day surgery procedures&mdash;this will be of interest to Senator Herron&mdash;in nine Queensland hospitals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently, about 25 per cent of all hospital procedures in Australian hospitals are undertaken on a day only basis. It is a widely held view that, ultimately, almost half of all hospital procedures could be day only. This component of the funding to Queensland will ensure that the incidence of day only surgery will continue to move in the right direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are obviously significant advantages from the point of view of the efficient use of hospital resources. Also, it can enable patients to recover within the home environment rather than in the hospital. This theme is also illustrated by the fact that more than $5.7m will be directed towards increasing post-acute services that allow the early discharge of terminally ill patients. Fifteen hospitals in Queensland will benefit from this package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This shows that the Government is committed to the quality of care within our public hospital system in a way which is immediately to be contrasted with the proposals of the Opposition which, as Senator Herron will know, will leave public hospitals in the States denuded of funds. Because the Opposition proposes to reduce the expenditure to the States by 5 per cent, it must reduce the funds put into public hospitals, and the Opposition hopes to fill the gap with private insurance premiums. That is the way the Opposition intends to fill the gap&mdash;without any improvement in services.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Giles has raised a very important health question. Quite clearly, a society can very quickly change its culture and its outlook in relation to breast feeding, which is quite clearly the best, most nutritious and most healthy way in which to feed young infants. Indeed, with high pressure advertising, it can be the case that young mothers are diverted into using infant formulas in an inappropriate way as a substitute for breast feeding rather than as a last resort or an alternative when that particular method of feeding is not available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Giles also mentions the World Health Organisation, which has published an international code on the marketing of breast milk substitutes or infant formulas. It is extremely important that in Australia we have agreement from the producers, the distributors and the importers of these particular substitutes in order to ensure that advertisements do not occur in the marketplace in a way which, as I say, can mislead young women into adopting a less nutritious method of feeding their children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over a couple of months late last year, all interested parties were gathered together by the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs in order to negotiate an agreement. Indeed, the chief executives of five or six importers or distributors gathered in Melbourne on 21 May to sign an agreement, a document witnessed by Mr Howe and me. That was on the eleventh anniversary of the adoption by the World Health Organisation of the code which governs the marketing of these infant formulas. Those chief executives of the Australian manufacturers and importers agreed not to advertise these products and not to engage in practices which, as I say, could lead to a distortion of choices that ought to be made purely on health grounds by women in relation to the feeding, particularly the breast feeding, of their infants.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the circumstances surrounding the implication against me&mdash;a breach of ministerial responsibility, against my own principles&mdash;it is not at all obvious that anything went wrong in any ordinary sense of the English language, and I will explain that point in a moment. Nor is it the case that anyone is to blame for such events as did occur. If Senator Hill is talking about my ministerial responsibility&mdash;and I presume he is&mdash;the question at issue is whether I should have been told about a possible contact that was made between Mr Symons and our Washington Embassy back in April of this year at a time when, it is reasonably clear, my Department knew of it and passed the information to my office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make clear that there was nothing inherently wrong about such a contact being set up or occurring in the first place. It is not as though there had been obvious maladministration, mis-expenditure of public money, a breach of public trust, a criminal action or a default of any other kind. The matter in issue is simply whether I had been told about a possible contact occurring. There is nothing inherently wrong in such a contact occurring. In the light of all the information that has been revealed since then, no-one's judgment has been altered on that. There was certainly nothing wrong about the way in which the matter was handled by the Washington Embassy when the particular contact did take place which was foreshadowed as being possible by the communication in question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What went wrong that is a matter for which anyone should accept responsibility? The only thing that allegedly went wrong was a failure to communicate that particular information to me. Was that a blameworthy failure to communicate? I certainly did not regard my failure to be told of the particular detail in question as constituting any kind of blameworthy conduct on the part of my office, notwithstanding the calumnies that are being spread in that context. I did not see any neglect. I certainly did not see any culpable neglect of the kind for which someone should accept responsibility, query the Minister and query the staff member concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will go through the reasons why, because it is important to put these matters on the public record. To the extent that the communication in question, the one in April, was about the arrest which occurred in the Marshall Islands, and the reports of some phone contact with the Marshall Islands having been made by Senator Richardson&mdash;that was the way in which my senior adviser remembered the call in question&mdash;that was not about anything new as far as I was concerned or as far as he was concerned. That was simply confirming information&mdash;putting it into a different context&mdash;which I knew about and which my senior adviser knew about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know some people derive some nourishment from endlessly gossiping to each other, telling each other things they already know. I know lots of people who are like that, with nothing better to do. But I and my staff have better things to do than to tell each other&mdash;particularly across half the world&mdash;things that we already know. So to that extent, there was nothing blameworthy about the failure of communication.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The adviser in question manifestly did not recall the Washington reference, on his own testimony, which I do not doubt for a moment. Even if he had, it has to be understood and we have to appreciate, for God's sake, that if we are talking about wrongdoing, if we are talking about someone being blameworthy&mdash;whether it is a Minister on his behalf or anyone else&mdash;at that particular time there was nothing particularly significant about that piece of information which has everybody so excited subsequently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anyone could be forgiven for omitting to remember, or to pass on, a piece of information that was so inherently insignificant at the time. When it is remembered, and I wish to goodness I had remembered last week that this was the day in question, that the day in question, 6 April, was the very day that the assault took place on the Iranian Embassy&mdash;in a context which generated a huge amount of excitement in my particular office, with phone calls having to be made in and out all day long and, in fact, all hell breaking loose being a reasonable description of it, and in an environment where I was away and two other senior staff members were away&mdash;the fact that something slipped between the cracks in the way that this obviously did is even less obviously a matter for blame when directed to my staff or to anyone else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only reason that I even mentioned my failure to be advised about this particular matter was obviously because of the necessity to do so in order to explain why it was that I had not, in fact, misled the Senate when I said on 7 May that I had no knowledge of a particular contact or likely contact in Washington. I had no knowledge for all the reasons that are clearly now on the public record. The question of my knowledge was squarely in issue; it had to be established in order to put my credibility beyond doubt that I had not been the subject of any communication.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not a matter of blaming anyone; it is not a matter of wrongdoing by anyone; it is not a matter of any default or wrongdoing in the system such as should attract `responsibility' by anyone, let alone ministerial responsibility.

I back away not one iota from what I said on the subject of ministerial responsibility in 1982 or at any other time.

It would not be a matter for which the Government would wish to try to influence the Australian Securities Commission in any way either to favourably dispose it towards any particular company or, of course, to try to encourage it to levy a penalty. It is a matter entirely within the jurisdiction and discretion of the Australian Securities Commission.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services. The Minister will be aware of the major contribution made by carers, mainly women, who care for elderly and disabled family members at home. However, is the Minister aware that their entitlement to the domiciliary nursing care benefit has remained at $42 per fortnight since 1981? Will the Minister advise what steps have been taken to review the carers allowance to ensure that appropriate recognition is given to the economic value of women's work in caring for the nation's elderly and disabled?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fact is that the Government has taken a very real interest in the role of carers, particularly those who are relatives of aged and frail persons or those who have to take care of disabled young people within the family. Quite often, without in any way trying to indulge in stereotypes, clearly the carers are women who are caring for frail, aged partners or for perhaps disabled children who are growing older. They undertake a considerable burden on the part of those relatives, and we are a more compassionate society because such people at times undertake such burdensome duties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is also a fact that there needs to be a government structure to help those carers. The home and community services program, of course, provides many services which help with respite care for the aged and which provide for home nursing, home help, food services, home maintenance and modification, and community transport. These are all of direct benefit to carers in so far as they relieve them of some of the duties which they would otherwise have to undertake.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The domiciliary nursing care benefit is not means tested; it is a benefit paid to carers of people who would otherwise be eligible for nursing home care. Senator Reynolds was quite right about the rate; I think it is $3 per day. That rate is being looked at in the review of the effectiveness of the domiciliary nursing care benefit. We must try to find the best ways possible to support carers and to recognise their contribution to the community. We are constantly reviewing the effectiveness of the various programs, particularly within the home and community care sector. Those are the programs that need to be taken into account when looking at the total picture of government support for carers.</PARA>

That action arose out of the Symons matter in the sense that the Marshalls' Attorney-General, Dennis McPhillips, had raised the possibility of a future extradition request by the Marshalls in that matter.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Short this day relating to the national accounts figures.</PARA>
<PARA>I am sorry to see Senator Button leaving the chamber. He might learn a little bit about his economy and national accounts statistics if he stayed. During Question Time, in response to my question about the March quarter national accounts, Senator Button claimed, amongst other things, that the profitability of business was rising in this country as shown in the March quarter national accounts. To illustrate that, he referred to one of the figures called the gross operating surplus of the business sector. What that figure omits to show&mdash;because it does not include it&mdash;is the interest and tax paid by the private sector on its gross earnings. As a measure of the ability of the corporate sector to make profits and to invest and reinvest, the gross operating surplus is a meaningless concept. The accurate concept is the net operating surplus which takes into account interest and tax paid by businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that basis, in the national accounts, the net operating surplus fell from $25 billion in the December quarter to $18.9 billion in the March quarter. I would think that that is one of the largest falls in net operating surplus ever recorded. The March figure is below even the figure for the September quarter 1991 of $20.6 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Budget figures last year, the Budget statements showed a table giving the figures and a graph for the net operating surplus. That showed that as at June last year the net operating surplus of businesses in Australia was at the lowest level it had been since figures were first recorded a quarter of a century ago. There was some pick-up in the September and December quarters of this current financial year, but we have now had a huge plunge in that figure in the March quarter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other statistics contained in the national accounts figures for March confirm the figures I have just referred to. For example, company retained earnings, which is a very important source of savings and investment in Australia, collapsed from plus $2.1 billion in the December quarter to minus $2.2 billion in the March quarter. In other words, there was a dissavings by companies during that period and a major turnaround in their position of well over $4 billion. Similarly, in the March quarter, household savings collapsed and were down to $2.5 billion. That compares with $6.9 billion in the December quarter, which is a massive fall. Overall, national savings in the March quarter showed a minus figure of almost $500m compared with a plus figure of $1.6 billion in the December quarter, and even that historically was a very low level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What those figures show&mdash;quite contrary to what Senator Button implied and indeed stated in his response to my question today&mdash;is that savings have collapsed in this country. The pick-up that had perhaps been starting to occur very tentatively in the September and December quarters of this financial year has turned around very strongly to a negative position in the March quarter. That reflects only one thing: that the business community and the household sector in Australia have lost confidence completely in this Government and have lost the wherewithal to save and invest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course the business community will be neither able nor prepared to invest while the Party on the opposite side remains in power. Why would it? This Government has absolutely lost control of its economic policy processes. The Budget is totally out of control. We have had a deterioration in the fiscal position of the Commonwealth of almost $19 billion in the last two years alone, which is absolutely unprecedented in Australia's history. The implications of that for the year ahead and beyond are enormous in terms of the negative influences on the business community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is therefore no wonder that today Senator Button absolutely walked away from the `One Nation-One Job' growth forecast of 4 3/4 per cent for next year. He knows as well as us that that is an unachievable figure. Therefore, there is no way in the world that the growth prospects, spending proposals and all the other fairies-at-the-bottom-of-the-garden proposals that are contained in that statement can be achieved. It is unfortunate that Senator Button, in his response to my question today, chose to give such a misleading impression of the implications of the March quarter national accounts. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2 June 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, I present the report relating to the following proposed work:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The refurbishment and fitout of Juliana House, Phillip, ACT.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report which I have just tabled is for the  refurbishment and fitout of Juliana House in the Phillip-Woden area of the ACT. This project is sponsored, and will be managed, by the Australian Estate Management, a Division of the Department of Administrative Services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian Estate Management is accountable to government for the effective asset management of the office estate, of which Juliana House forms a part. The office estate is fully commercialised and tenants, principally government departments, pay market based rents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed scope of the work will include:  repairs to damaged ceilings, replacement of carpets, upgrading of electricity supply and all mechanical services, including lifts and the fire protection system, in order to meet relevant Australian building codes and standards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Disabled persons facilities will also be provided in accordance with the relevant codes.  These will include: ramp access to the main entrance to the building, lifts with voice indicator facilities, lower controls access for wheelchair users and braille controls for the visually impaired.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government had given its approval for the design and commencement of refurbishment at a total cost of $8.27 million dollars with expenditure of four hundred and sixty thousand dollars in 1991/92. Australian Estate Management subsequently sought additional funds of five hundred and ten thousand dollars from the Department of Finance to increase the scope of works, to carry out a major upgrade of the lift services. These the Australian Estate Management considered were below normal requirements of modern office accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated total cost for the project now stands at $8.78 million with expenditure of four hundred and sixty thousand dollars in 1991/92. The project is scheduled for completion by January 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee believes that every effort should be made to complete this project by the end of 1993, in order to avoid the considerable cost which could be incurred by the traditional Christmas period close-down of the building industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Health, Housing and Community Services will occupy the refurbished Juliana House.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since its creation in July 1987, the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services has been pursuing an accommodation policy aimed at collocating its staff in central and state offices. In Canberra, it is collocating in the Woden-Phillip area and by its move to Juliana House will relinquish comparable space in privately leased accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee agrees that a need exists to refurbish Juliana House to bring it up to modern office standards for leasing to the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services. Accordingly, the Committee has approved the project.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee, however, has reservations relating to the cost benefits of this proposal to the prospective tenant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee was disturbed to learn that the financial impact of the re-negotiation of leases on the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services, will result at best in a cost neutral budget. In all probability, the department anticipates a small budgetary increase.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nor does the department anticipate any staff savings or a reduction in the number of vehicles used for courier service by its move to Juliana House.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee was told by the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services that the benefits it would derive from moving to Juliana House were in the main, qualitative, such as:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">easier access by clients and service providers</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">flexibility to accommodate organisational change</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">enhanced security of its resources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Juliana House is a product of the basic office block design of the 1960s. It stands amongst equals with a cluster of buildings in the Woden Town Centre, all taking their names from the ships of the first, second and third fleets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the Committee inspected Juliana House prior to the public inquiry, it saw a building with little aesthetic appeal and with many of its services at the end of their operational life.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee questioned the value of retaining this building, but Australian Estate Management maintained that, neither a "fire sale" nor leasing are options in the building's present condition. Also, that it was quite likely that an unrefurbished empty building in the Phillip-Woden area would remain vacant with loss of benefits to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Based on this judgment, the Committee recommends that the proposal should proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Committee is of the view that the estimated cost for the refurbishment and fitout estimated at $8.78 million dollars is excessive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Juliana House was presented to the Committee as a structurally sound building, requiring no major internal or external structural changes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, during the last ten years, maintenance work of approximately six hundred and four thousand dollars has been carried out on Juliana House. The work described included many of the upgrades proposed in the current scope of the work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the public inquiry, the major part of the Committee's  questions centred on the issue of cost reduction of the work. The Committee was presented with alternative floor layouts to those proposed, and in the Committee's view, these have merit and should be examined.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee rejects a proposal for the provision of a block of unisex showers on the ground floor. The Committee believes that the block of showers is inappropriately located, adjacent to the conference facilities and the public area. The Committee is of the opinion that, an alternative proposal to modify the plumbing in the male and female toilet area on each floor, has merit and should be implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee concludes that the cost of the proposal estimated at $8.78 million dollars is excessive. The Committee recommends that the project, including floor layouts should be thoroughly re-examined with the aim of substantially reducing the estimated costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the report to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make some comments in relation to the report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The refurbishment and fitout of Juliana House, Phillip, ACT </EMPHASIS>which has just been tabled. Within the report, the Committee has approved the cost of the refurbishment of part of Juliana House in the sum of $8.27m and an additional sum, bringing it to $8.78m. The project is scheduled for completion by January 1994, although the Committee recommends that it be completed by the end of 1993 to avoid the additional costs of the summer break which would otherwise be added to the cost of the building.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter I refer to in particular is the very disappointing fact that expenditure of only $460,000 is scheduled for 1991-92. Of course, we do not actually know whether the expenditure for the remaining amount will be allocated in the forthcoming Budget. The reason this is of importance to the ACT is that more than 1,500 office workers have been moved from the Woden and Phillip areas in recent times. Most of them have been moved to Tuggeranong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly do not object to office workers being relocated in Tuggeranong, because honourable senators will remember that at the time the Government approved the construction of the Tuggeranong town centre it had already promised that by the time its construction was complete there would be government office workers in the area, and that was not the case. The impact on the shopkeepers who then went into the Hyperdome at Tuggeranong was absolutely devastating. It is only some years after that that area is even beginning to look like a viable trading area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Office workers have now been moved to Tuggeranong and it is Woden that has suffered the loss. The fact is that Juliana House, this building we are now considering, has been empty for some time as workers have been moved out of it. There are other empty blocks, Medibank House, the Cosmopolitan building, the Sir Keith Campbell building and Scarborough House&mdash;the patent office works out of Scarborough House at the moment&mdash;a mix of government and privately-owned buildings, but it is substantially government employees who have been moved from the area. Any area from which one moves about 1,500 office workers is very significantly affected. In Woden Plaza, a number of shops in the area nearest the office buildings have fallen on very heavy times. Quite apart from the recession we had to have and everything else that has affected trading, this particular area has suffered the loss of 1,500 office workers and has no great prospects of them returning there in the very near future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are told that the Juliana House project, which is the subject of the report before us today, is not expected to be completed until January 1994. I reiterate my concern that the $460,000 being spent in this financial year presumably relates only to some of the design work being done for the building. Whether the Government will allocate funds in the next Budget to enable the project to be completed on time or whether it will be deferred because of budgetary considerations is a matter of great interest to traders in the Woden and Phillip area, especially since we do not know when office workers will return to the other buildings that I have mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could go on at some length. But I reiterate: there has been a total lack of concern by the Government about the impact that the allocation of office space for its employees will have on people who have, in good faith, been established in the area for some time. Juliana House was opened in the 1960s. It was trading before Woden Plaza was built&mdash;as were some of these other buildings. The project has been handled in a such a way that absolutely no regard whatever has been shown for the shopkeepers and traders in that area. I repeat: I am not suggesting that office workers should not have been placed in Tuggeranong. But there certainly was not any planning or any consideration of the impact on private sector companies in Canberra when these decisions were made. </PARA>

<PARA>In moving the motion, I draw attention to two separate aspects of this proposed judicial inquiry. The first relates to the many questions raised in recent weeks regarding the possible intercession by a Minister, Ministers, staffs of Ministers or members of the bureaucracy on behalf of the business dealings of Mr Symons. The second, which is really a quite separate issue although it has arisen out of this matter, is the appropriateness of the ministerial conduct which has surrounded these issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important to recognise that in relation to the latter matter when Senator Richardson resigned from the Ministry he did so claiming that his reason lay in not wishing to damage the ability of the Government to go on and win the next election nor to do damage to the Labor Party and the Government. Senator Richardson himself has not admitted, and we have not heard any Ministers on the Government side admit, that what he did in interceding on Mr Symons's behalf was in any sense behaviour inappropriate for a Minister. We believe that matter, along with the question of the actions that were or may have been taken, should be tested&mdash;and should be tested before an independent judicial inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, the behaviour of Senator Richardson which has been catalogued repeatedly in this chamber in issuing a reference, as he claims, with very little knowledge of the business background of Mr Symons begs the question whether that was appropriate behaviour for a Minister, knowing as he did at least that the business which was to be set up was not even to be conducted in Australia but conducted overseas. Was that indeed appropriate behaviour for a Minister?  We believe that it was not appropriate and there are probably quite a few people in this chamber who believe that that was not appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that sort of decision should be tested so that in the future we are not left in this vague area&mdash;and the vagueness of it was actually agreed to by Senator Evans when I asked him the specific question in this case relating to Senator Richardson's intercession on behalf of Mr Symons for the return of the passport after he had been arrested. Specifically, the question to Senator Evans was: was it appropriate for Senator Evans to have given the advice to Senator Richardson that Senator Richardson could make such an approach? Senator Evans in his reply said that this was a vague area. We may well all agree that it is a vague area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under those circumstances, when a person is actually before the courts in a foreign country and the intercession is on behalf of that person in relation to one of the matters before the courts, should a senior Minister intercede in any way in that action in the foreign country; or should that be the prerogative exclusively of the Foreign Minister? I tend to the latter view. The point I am getting to is that Senator Evans agreed that that was a grey area; it was one which required further elucidation. Consequently, it would be very useful to bring to bear on this matter an independent person who could look at these matters and, hopefully, lay down some sort of criteria by which we might be guided and by which Ministers in future might be guided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout much of the questioning in these last couple of weeks, there have been implications&mdash;and I do not put it any higher than that&mdash;that members of ministerial staff, other Ministers or bureaucrats perhaps have been leant on to further the interests of Mr Symons. So far, we do not know whether that has occurred, and in answers to those sorts of questions Senator Evans principally but also others have said, `You provide the evidence and then we will carry out an inquiry'. It seems that that really is the wrong way to go; that with all the evidence within government departments it is appropriate that that evidence be brought out from there rather than that those who are in the dark as to what might have gone on be required to produce the evidence first of all. We make no judgment in relation to these matters as to whether these intercessions by other persons did or did not take place, whether they were or were not appropriate, and to what extent they may have furthered the business interests of Mr Symons. But it does seem to us that we have reached a point in this situation where the business of the Senate is becoming bogged down. Today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> lists 64 Bills still to be dealt with in a period of 2 1/2 weeks, and there is an urgent need to get on with that legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have not supported a Senate inquiry, and I think most people recognise that a Senate inquiry would be an unlikely forum to come to very satisfactory conclusions in either of the matters that I have placed before the Senate today. With a Senate committee comprising three members of the Opposition, one could imagine that in a period such as this leading up to an election there would be strong emphasis on, let us say, gunning for the Government. On the Government side, there would very likely be very strong defence, irrespective of whether it were justified or not. At the same time as that inquiry was going on, it is very likely that as titbits of information came out there would be continual press meetings&mdash;particularly from the Opposition side&mdash;keeping the issue alive. For that reason, as I think Senator Hill himself has recognised on several occasions, an independent inquiry is a more appropriate way to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Returning to the issue of ministerial conduct, honourable senators will recognise from the terms of this committee of inquiry that it is also a prospective look at an appropriate code of ministerial conduct because the Government has not addressed the issue of ministerial conduct at all. Senator Richardson's explanation that his assistance to Mr Symons was in the course of his normal duties relating to his constituency has not been questioned by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), despite the fact that this explanation does not stand up to the slightest scrutiny. Senator Evans's actions in giving the green light to a highly controversial phone call to the President of the Marshall Islands has similarly not been questioned&mdash;although, as I indicated, Senator Evans has indicated that that permission is a grey area which requires some further elucidation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, hanging off this is the suggestion, which has been dealt with in some questions, of the rumours which were circulating in the Marshall Islands as to whether other approaches were made to other Ministers in the Marshall Islands. It would be useful to bring those rumours before an independent committee which was aware of them to find out whether they had any substance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The closeness of Senator Richardson's connections with Mr Symons's business activities has raised rumours and suggestions that subterranean influences were brought to bear to expedite Mr Symons's various dealings with government departments. I stress again that the Democrats pass no judgment on the accuracy of these suggestions. However, we are convinced that they will not be put to rest until an independent, credible and public inquiry is conducted. The Democrats are convinced that a Senate inquiry is a totally inappropriate forum for the airing of these issues. Unlike Senate inquiries, a public, open judicial inquiry would be objective and justice far more likely to be done and be seen to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Symons obviously had extraordinary access to Senator Richardson and to the resources of his office. The assistance provided, we believe, went well beyond the bounds of Senator Richardson's responsibility to his constituents. For example, there is the provision of the reference on ministerial letterhead without any background checks. What are the appropriate checks?<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Ministers are to provide references under such circumstances for businesses in foreign countries, first of all, should those references be issued? If they are to be issued, what sort of checks are appropriate so that not only is the good name of this country protected but also that those in foreign countries are protected from the activities of somebody of perhaps doubtful business background?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rapid assistance for migration applications by Mr Symons's clients is another matter. While parliamentarians, of course, commonly deal with immigration problems, the normal procedure is to provide help once applications have been delayed or rejected. Senator Richardson's office seems to have actually lodged applications on behalf of Mr Symons and those applications appear to have contained false information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the matter of the placing of the phone call to the head of another country to request that Mr Symons's passport be returned to allow him into Australia to prepare his defence to the charges of forgery. Most Australian parliamentarians limit their interventions in legal proceedings to prisoners of conscience imprisoned by undemocratic regimes with poor human rights records. None of these conditions apply to Senator Richardson's actions. Again, I stress: what are the appropriate limits for a Minister to intercede in legal proceedings in another country? It would be very useful to be able to lay down some firm guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have the intercession by Senator Richardson with the President of the Senate for the purposes of expediting Mr Symons's access to US congressmen. As I indicated, we have already made a judgment regarding Senator Sibraa's actions here, believing that he was an instrument of the incredible intercessional web woven by Senator Richardson. Nonetheless, it indicates the extent to which ministerial influence can be exercised through other people. The question arises of whether that influence was exercised through others in a ministerial capacity or a staff capacity or through the bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just good enough to pass these and other forms of assistance off as constituency duties; they are not. They are nothing if not cronyism at work to the detriment of the reputation of the Government and, as it turned out, to the detriment of the reputation of this country. They have embroiled Senator Sibraa and Senator Evans, with Senator Evans giving what the Democrats regard as inappropriate&mdash;and I stress again, inappropriate&mdash;advice on the question of the phone call to the Marshall Islands President. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this context it is hardly surprising that suggestions of pressure being applied below ministerial level in support of Symons are circulating widely. It has become clear to the Democrats that these rumours&mdash;these stories&mdash;will not go away without an inquiry. We believe that it is in the interests of the Government also for such an inquiry to be held to lay to rest these stories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be that nothing will be revealed. Nevertheless, it is important that the air be cleared and that the issue of ministerial standards be addressed. I return to that point: in the context of this Senate, where we do not even have a code of ethical behaviour for senators, much less Ministers, we believe that it would be very appropriate for this to be addressed and for the matters to be teased out. This would be a very useful starting point for such a teasing out and the laying down of at least a draft code of ministerial conduct. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government does not accept that there is any justification for a judicial inquiry of the kind proposed by Senator Coulter today. He divides the issues, as does his motion, into two parts. The issues within the proposed terms of reference so far as the actions of Ministers, ministerial staff and bureaucrats are concerned have been the subject of sustained public exposure for more than a month now, as well as pretty relentless assault here in this Parliament for the last week and a half.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notwithstanding all that exposure, there has simply been no prima facie evidence of wrongdoing that has emerged on the part of any Minister, ministerial staffer or departmental officer in relation to the business activities of Mr Symons that could possibly justify this kind of inquiry. It might be unreasonable to ask for conclusive evidence before one sets in train an inquiry of this kind, but it is not unreasonable to ask for prima facie evidence. I suggest to Senator Coulter, in all fairness, that he ought to consider whether any government in the world would be prepared to set in train an expensive, time consuming and necessarily very sensitive exercise of this kind without there at least being prima facie evidence of actual wrongdoing to justify it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two particular areas that Senator Coulter has referred to, I think, in various public comments that may justify close scrutiny by such an inquiry. One is the matter of access to export market development grants by Mr Symons or companies with which he may have some association. In the course of my remarks I want to address in some detail that particular issue to try to demonstrate to Senator Coulter, in all fairness, that despite all the herrings that have been laid out, they are, in fact, all red and they do not lead anywhere, and an inquiry would simply have nowhere to go in pursuing those particular matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, so far as immigration issues are concerned, Senator Tate, in the time available to him, will address in a little detail the kinds of issues that have been raised.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the extent that questions have been raised about Senator Richardson's associations with Mr Symons while he was a Minister, it is the case that Senator Richardson has already paid the ultimate political price for those associations with his resignation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will always be argument about the precise description and application, in particular, of the last category&mdash;the conventions of Westminster government. There will always, I suspect, be grey areas. It is inappropriate to believe that an inquiry of the kind that Senator Coulter is talking about by a single judicial officer would, any more than the Bowen inquiry, for example, some years ago, produce absolutely definitive guidelines of a kind that were universally accepted, universally applicable, without any doubt in any particular situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have addressed today the question of ministerial responsibility as it has been raised in relation to me concerning my answers in this place and my state of knowledge on various matters and the events that led up to them. I also answered in some detail on Thursday, 28 May last week the question that was put to me by Senator Coulter about the particular phone call and my responsibility for that. I acknowledge that there are debatable issues arising out of, as I indicated last week, that latter matter, but I honestly suggest to Senator Coulter that this Parliament is the best place to debate issues of that kind. If we are going to seek any ultimate resolution of them, we cannot expect some judicial officer to do the job for us in a way that will answer all these questions once and for all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an example of the kind of issue that has been constantly raised over the last few days, I come back to the question of access by Mr Symons or companies on his behalf to EMDGs. Earlier in Question Time I described the general way in which the export market development grant system works. Again, for the sake of brevity, I will not repeat that now. It is terribly important to understand the minimal extent to which discretion applies in the administration of those particular grants and the relatively automatic way in which criteria are satisfied and ticked off, and moneys are paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to go through all the various contexts in which these particular grants have been raised in recent days and at least explain why it is that, in our judgment, there is no basis for an inquiry to be pursued so far as any of this is concerned. I am constrained in what I can say about particular applications because of the secrecy provisions of the Australian Trade Commission Act and the Freedom of Information Act. I have no discretion to release documentation or, for that matter, any detailed information derived from such documentation concerning the business affairs of another person without first giving that person the opportunity to put a case as to why the information should not be released. That constrains me now in my ability to talk in detail about what the actual activities were that were the subject of these various grants. But I am not constrained, of course, from being quite explicit about material that is not contained in files or records that bear upon this, and I think it might be helpful, in putting all this in some context, to go into that in a little detail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The grants fall into various categories. The first are those that have gone directly to Mr Symons as a sole trader, as an individual, or to some company with which he has had a major, explicit association. There are two such grants in that category. The first worth mentioning is that to Unipac International in 1990-91. The most I can say about that project is that it did operate in the Pacific area, but that it involved the education sector and that it, certainly on all the knowledge we have, on the advice available to me, did not involve the business migration scheme in any way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to that particular grant, it was paid to Mr Symons as a sole trader in December 1991 in the amount of $131,443. Austrade informs me that it has no evidence connecting Mr Symons's activities in the Marshall Islands with payments he had received under the EMDG scheme in relation to this matter or, for that matter, anything else; nor has Austrade had any representations made to it on Mr Symons's behalf in relation to this matter by anyone, including Senator Richardson. Generally I am advised by Austrade that it dealt with this matter no differently from the way it deals with any of the other 3,000 or so Australian small to medium businesses which apply for an export market development grant each year. I have already said that this grant was quite unrelated to the Marshall Islands and quite unrelated to any business migration service, which is not an eligible service within the meaning of the Act anyway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second grant that was made to Mr Symons, or at least to a company with which he was a prominent player, was the grant to Feedtech Pty Ltd&mdash;and that was in 1986-87&mdash;for what I can describe only as a project in north-east Asia in the agricultural sector but not involving steel mills, business migration or anything of that kind. The Feedtech grant was for $141,559. The notice of determination for it was issued on 26 July. The company was paid the amount in question on 23 August. A question has arisen about the status of the company&mdash;being in receivership and so on. That has been separately debated. I have nothing more to add in relation to that aspect of the matter except to draw attention again to the statutory obligation of EMDG to make pay-outs notwithstanding the status of receivership, liquidation or whatever of the company in question. As I have acknowledged to Senator Coulter, that does raise a policy question that perhaps needs some review in light of this, but it is not something that is susceptible to judicial inquiry in this context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the Feedtech grant, there is no documentation on Austrade's files which suggests that Feedtech applied for or received EMDG moneys remotely related to either the Marshall Islands or to business migration. There is no evidence that Austrade had representations made on its behalf by Senator Richardson or by anyone else. There is no evidence of representations being made, for that matter, in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan or anywhere else by Senator Richardson or any other parliamentarian. To the extent that this may have had something to do with China, this particular grant was not involved in any way with the steel industry in China or anywhere else. So I can state a series of negative propositions about that which may put to rest some particular furphies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from those two particular matters, Austrade has no record of any contact with either Mr Symons or Feedtech, the company of which he was managing director, at any of its 14 offices in Australia or its 65 offices overseas, other than that which necessarily occurred in the normal and stringent processing of the EMDG applications in question for these two particular grants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is to be said about businesses with which Mr Symons is alleged to have had some association? A number of firm names or businesses have been mentioned in this respect in recent days. I will quickly go through them. One was the Pacific Design Group. That has been the subject of an FOI application by Mr Peacock and there have been questions also from Senator O'Chee. Pacific Design Group has received two payments under the EMDG scheme, the first in April 1991 for $128,066 and the second in October 1991 for $129,057, for the 1989-90 and 1990-91 grant years respectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Pacific Design Group files in Austrade have nothing in them to suggest that it had any dealings at all with Mr Symons; there is nothing in the files bearing upon that issue. There is nothing to suggest that there had been any dealings with Senator Richardson in relation to that. There is nothing to suggest that there were any representations made to Austrade on behalf of that business by Senator Richardson or any other parliamentarian. There is nothing to suggest that there were any dealings with the Marshall Islands by that particular company. There is nothing to suggest that it was involved in business migration schemes in the Marshall Islands or anywhere else. And there is nothing to suggest that it applied for or received any EMDG moneys pertaining to the use of consultants of any kind, either in Australia or overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think that leaves any room for any further questions about Mr Symons's involvement with that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the process of questioning in the Parliament is not really suited to what we are seeking to do and that is to put together the picture of what is a complicated business migration scam. I can, however, advise the Senate of a few pieces of the jigsaw that have now become apparent, stressing that there is still a lot that is unknown. We do know that about $US1.25m has been lost through this scam. We know that it was put together by a mate of the Labor Party, and particularly a mate of Senator Richardson, one Greg Symons. We know that it is a story about connections with government used to advance improper objectives. We know it was to involve the granting of passports to the Marshall Islands, primarily to get entry for the recipients into the United States. We know it was to cost so-called investors a quarter of a million dollars US per head. In other words, before the scam was discovered, five investors had paid up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that, although it was the brainchild of Symons, there is also the involvement to an undetermined extent of another lawyer, one Finch, who had worked in the Marshall Islands. We know that they used innocent professionals to help develop their scheme. These professionals are reputable people who were induced, at least in part, by a glowing reference of Senator Richardson on ministerial letterhead in favour of Mr Symons. That was a reference both as to his personal bona fides and also as to his sound business background. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not know for certain when that was written, but I have seen one copy that was forwarded to one of these professionals who had been brought within this program on Social Security fax letterhead dated 7 June. It does seem that, in fact, the reference may have been written for the purpose of Mr Symons's Marshall Islands venture. We know that it was a reference which was wrong in fact. Symons had a tarnished business background, to express it in its most favourable terms. It is a background littered with creditors as Symons seems to have moved from one scheme to another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cover for the scheme was to be the development and operation of a technology park and university in the Marshall Islands. This was to produce an aura of legitimacy. Whether Symons ever intended the construction of the project we do not know. Interestingly, there are still some who believe that it could have been a feasible project if he had gone about it legitimately. The real inducement for investors was to be access to the United States via, first, citizenship in the Marshall Islands and then a passport. It seems that Mr Symons made a mistake in that he asserted that Marshall Islands passports gave investors immediate access to the United States. So he set about seeking a change in US law and, again, sought the assistance of his influential friend, Senator Richardson, who introduced him to Senator Sibraa, the President of the Senate, who then wrote to the Australian Embassy in Washington for help. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might mention in passing that of course Senator Richardson also made contact with the United States Ambassador to help Mr Symons with his project additionally. Of course, Senator Sibraa, who is in the same faction as Senator Richardson, astonishingly neither checked the facts with the Department of Foreign Affairs nor informed DFAT in Canberra or the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Furthermore, he got the facts in his reference wrong in that he asserted that Australia had been asked by the President of the Marshall Islands for help. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The extent to which the Australian Government helped in Washington is still unclear. It seems that the diplomat Mr Lamb, whom I readily acknowledge is a respected and experienced diplomat, had reservations, despite the fact that Symons was promoted to him as a friend of Richo's and that Symons reinforced the Richardson connection by producing a copy of a memorandum purportedly from Mr Symons to Senator Richardson detailing the scheme and asserting Senator Richardson's knowledge of the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not know exactly what Symons represented to Mr Lamb, because the Government is not prepared to let us hear Mr Lamb's story. We do find it astonishing that the memorandum was not forwarded to Canberra with the Sibraa letter back in November or when the controversy raged here in Canberra during April, but again we are denied the benefit of an explanation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We find it disconcerting that this key document was not discovered until after the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) demanded a search of DFAT's files in mid May.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With this letter of introduction from the President of the Senate under presidential letterhead, the Richardson reference under ministerial letterhead and the copy of the memorandum purportedly to Senator Richardson from Mr Symons, no doubt a strong case was made out in Washington of Australian Government support for what Mr Symons was seeking. Despite his so-called connections, it seems that changing US law was not so easy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Back in the Marshall Islands there is no doubt that Mr Symons had gained government support in principle for his scheme&mdash;again, we understand, using the Richardson reference and, interestingly, the letter of introduction from Senator Sibraa to Mr Lamb. I say `interestingly' because how he came by that is a mystery in itself. Senator Sibraa advised the Prime Minister that the only copy he had of it had gone to Lamb in Washington. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will be alleged that the Marshall Islands Government did not approve the details of the business migration scheme or, in other words, that it was not ready to go into operation. Using genuine documents from the Marshall Islands and allegedly using others which were not genuine, it seems that Mr Symons continued to impress, firstly, those he had engaged to develop and market the scheme and, secondly, potential investors, including all of those who did become investors. They were victims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another victim was Mr Chang. He was a victim in that he was an investor. Because Symons was unable to obtain Marshall Islands documentation for him, there was a need to get Chang Jnr back into Australia where he had been a student in order that he might continue his studies. It was decided by Mr Symons that this should be done through Fiji. Thus followed the supporting documentation from Multiplex&mdash;and here is this name which was mentioned by Senator Richardson's office. But a mistake was made. Clearly, the first of such documents was supposed to be with regard to Chang Jnr, but it was addressed to Chang Snr. An astute immigration officer of the Australian Government in Suva became suspicious and the abuse was defeated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the face of the documents, Multiplex has some explaining to do. I understand that Multiplex will argue that it was also misled by Symons. An inquiry will no doubt establish the facts in that regard. As for the part played by Senator Richardson's office in that matter, that would also be a subject of the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is alleged that Mr Symons's inability to deliver the product offered to investors led to the false documents and forgeries which are the substance of the charges in the Marshall Islands. We are obviously not interested in the issue of the alleged forgeries in the Marshall Islands, which will be pursued within the courts of the Marshall Islands. However, the intervention by Senator Richardson in then contacting the President of the Marshall Islands for the benefit of Mr Symons is something which obviously had the potential to embarrass Australia and should be examined by a committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The DFAT file note of 6 April regarding the rumour that Senator Richardson might have been contacting not only the President but other Cabinet Ministers seeking leniency for Symons should also be investigated. The suggestion is that Senator Richardson may have been engaged considerably beyond that which Senator Evans authorised. The authorisation by the Foreign Minister for Senator Richardson to seek to intervene in any event is, in our view, astonishing and should be looked at further. If I have time, I will return to the role of the Foreign Minister in due course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may have been that US residency was the inducement Symons was primarily offering his investors. However, he also made claims of being able to offer preferential access to overseas education facilities for students and entry into Australia if necessary which, it seemed, he sought in relation to the application of Chang Jnr. How Mr Symons was so confident that through his connections he was able to fix these things would also have to be looked at by this inquiry. How he was able to at least in part fund the venture, which seemed to be basically a business migration scheme&mdash;notwithstanding what Senator Evans just said to the Senate&mdash;with Austrade support through an export marketing development grant also requires proper investigation. We regard it as insufficient for Senator Evans to simply come in here and say that he has looked at the documents and we should have no reason for concern, particularly in light of the fact that Symons seems to have been the beneficiary of a number of such grants, as has his associates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way that Mr Symons was to use the export of education services may turn out to be the basis for legitimate claims for EMDGs, but that is something that will have to be investigated. We would seek the report of the judicial officer to be appointed in due course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was thus a scam involving a lot of money that had the potential to draw in much more but for the skills of the migration officer in Suva. It was a project developed in Australia and promoted by Australians, and is an international embarrassment to this country. That Australian officials were drawn into it to facilitate the scheme at the request of the most powerful within the Australian Government is particularly worrying. At least one Australian citizen lost a large sum of money, and it seems that some of the funds may have filtered back into Australia through a series of bank accounts in Hong Kong. However, since they have returned to Australia, they have not been able to be traced further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian people have a right to know the true story and the full story. So far, the picture of this Government has basically been one of obstruction. If the Government had nothing to hide, it would have instituted an independent inquiry weeks ago. But in this matter there is the issue of the mates of the New South Wales Right. Mr Keating is a mate, which is why he will fight this inquiry tooth and nail. Never mind getting to the truth and demonstrating to the Australian people that they can have faith in ministerial standards; never mind protection for the innocent and those at the moment who have no voice, such as the public servants who are not being permitted to put their side of the story by Senator Evans; and never mind Australia's international reputation in the United States, Taiwan and the Marshall Islands. The protection of his mates is more important to this Prime Minister. That is why the Parliament must persist until the Government is forced to meet its national responsibility. That is why the Parliament must insist on accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I had time, I would look specifically at the role of the Foreign Minister in relation to this matter, much of which is incidental to the primary case that is to be investigated by this inquiry. However, bearing in mind that we on this side have been limited to a speaking time of half an hour in this debate, and to be fair to my three colleagues who intend to use the last 15 minutes allotted to us, I will not do it on this occasion. I will use the occasion to mention to the Foreign Minister that I am looking forward to quoting to him in the very near future many parts of his 1982 speeches on ministerial standards and the Westminster system and to put them into the context of his deficiencies in this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to try to persuade the Senate that it should reject this proposal to set up a judicial inquiry into certain aspects of ministerial conduct relating to the Marshall Islands affair. I do so because, whilst Senator Coulter has tried to cloak this exercise as a very noble one and has attempted to have a goal or an aim of ensuring the proper functioning of the Westminster system so that we might have confidence in ministerial conduct&mdash;he talked about the need for codes of ministerial conduct&mdash;this is being pursued for sheer political advantage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter knows that the matter is running out of steam within both this chamber and the general community. In order to keep the matter running through the winter months, he has determined that we should have a forum which will probably generate some adverse publicity for the Government but will certainly, he hopes, keep himself in the limelight. It seems to me quite extraordinary that, of all people, Senator Coulter should, as I say, try to cloak this exercise in the garb of independent judicial inquiry as though that had some particular aura when he and the Australian Democrats were guilty of the most outrageous denials of natural justice to Senator Richardson in the weeks leading up to the current couple of weeks of the sitting of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A headline in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 16 May stated, `Senate threat to muzzle Richardson'. The Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Coulter, announced his verdict before Senator Richardson had prepared and lodged his written report to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). Senator Coulter announced his verdict in advance of giving Senator Richardson an opportunity to be heard. The most elementary principle of natural justice is that a person should be heard in his own defence before a verdict is pronounced. For Senator Coulter to come in here with this holier than thou attitude and say that we need to have this type of inquiry seems to me to be totally subverted&mdash;it was certainly put into perspective by the conduct of the Democrats in the lead-up to this fortnight of the parliamentary sittings. In fact, I find it quite incredible. It is no surprise that the Opposition has been tempted to support this exercise precisely for the reason that there is political advantage to be gained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought it is at least incumbent on the Democrats to discharge a fairly heavy onus of proof to convince this chamber that there is a need for a judicial inquiry as opposed to the ordinary processes of the Parliament which allows ministerial responsibility to the chamber or the Parliament as a whole. Basically, all Senator Coulter said was that there are rumours around the corridors which need to be chased down&mdash;there are suspicions, there are allegations, there are matters which are spoken of in mutterings and grumblings; misgivings are being expressed and suspicions are being voiced. He said&mdash;and I wrote these words down&mdash;that there are rumours around the corridors. Of course, Senator Coulter admitted that nothing may be found. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a fishing expedition. The inquiry would be set up simply in order to see whether there is any more dirt. That is what it is all about. There is nothing more to it than that. We have not heard what the rules of evidence will be but, presumably, they will not be those that are strictly applied in a criminal trial. All sorts of allegations will be made which will smear, distort and harm the reputation of individuals. The allegations may be answered by the end of the inquiry and, as Senator Coulter has said, in the end there may be nothing adverse to be found, nothing of substance to be reported on. In the meantime, the reputations of people will be destroyed. In so far as those reputations are blackened in the course of the inquiry, that may serve some political purpose. In fact, when the National Crime Authority was set up I decided that it ought to meet in private precisely so that the reputations of people would not be destroyed in the course of an inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it were the case that the Government could be said to be guilty of frustrating an examination of relevant matters, of trying to impede, frustrate or obstruct Federal agencies from doing their duty in relation to these matters, there might be something to talk about. But Senator Hill himself has talked about how astute, skilful, uncorrupted and perceptive immigration officials were in rejecting applications based on the Multiplex letters, for example, to Suva. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, I might mention that the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) has indicated that those letters ought to be the subject of the fullest inquiry by his departmental officials to see whether there was a prima facie case of breach of the law. The Multiplex executive has circulated a letter to all of us&mdash;which is his right, given the public controversy which has arisen. This ought to be welcomed. Certainly, it should assist in the investigation of these matters. Today Mr Hand decided to write to me asking that I bring the matter to the attention of the Australian Federal Police to investigate whether any offences have been committed against the Commonwealth. Of course, I have passed that on to the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police. I table that document for the interest of honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the Attorney-General's Department, once again the conversations which had been held between the Attorney-General of the Marshall Islands and an officer in the Department have been chronicled in the Senate. In so far as the Attorney-General of the Marshall Islands has forwarded certain material, that has in turn been sent on to the Australian Federal Police who have reported&mdash;and I think this has also been the subject of an answer in the Senate&mdash;that, on an examination of the papers, there was no particular offence against Commonwealth law disclosed. The Australian Federal Police had not thought that the materials and papers warranted referral to any other law enforcement agency in Australia. Nevertheless, the Attorney-General of the Marshall Islands has sought to forward further material. We have provided him with a contact in the New South Wales police in so far as matters raised in the Marshall Islands might also indicate fraud in terms of New South Wales law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So at every stage there has been the fullest cooperation by the Ministers&mdash;the Attorney and the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs&mdash;and their officials in ensuring that everything is done with the highest degree of propriety. Therefore, there is nothing to justify an inquiry. There is no suggestion that Ministers or ministerial officers have stood in the way, obstructed or frustrated the proper parliamentary process of questioning relating to the various issues surrounding Mr Symons and the Marshall Islands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I note that the second part of the motion speaks of the need for, and possible terms of, a code of ministerial conduct. It may well be&mdash;although, I do not say so&mdash;the judgment of this chamber or the other place that a code of ministerial conduct should be devised. I think it would be enormously difficult to construct a code of conduct in a way which was able to foresee every possible circumstance as the political life of the nation evolves. But if it were possible to construct such a code of conduct, it ought to be done by this place. The Senate should exercise its proper role as the body to which Ministers are responsible. To hand over that task to a judge or a QC, however eminent, seems to be a total abdication of duty on the part of senators in this place or members of the House of Representatives. If there is to be a code of ministerial conduct to make the requirements of ministerial responsibility clear so far as this chamber is concerned, let us take on that responsibility and do it ourselves. I think that could be done through the committees of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nothing has been brought forward by Senator Coulter which indicates that there is anything of substance which cannot be looked at, assessed or judged by the normal processes of this chamber&mdash;through Question Time or some other process. There is certainly nothing which Senator Coulter or the Opposition has said which discharges what I believe to be a heavy onus of proof to indicate what, in substance, would justify an independent judicial inquiry.

However, if it takes the Government two weeks to determine who is to conduct this inquiry and to see the inquiry genuinely launched, I suppose it could be some 10 weeks before it reported. This chamber would be gravely concerned and would voice that concern most loudly if, when we return on 16 June, this proposed resolution of the Senate has not been acted upon.

I make the assertion very genuinely&mdash;and I would in any circumstance&mdash;that the Senate committee system is one of the most undervalued means of inquiry in this nation. I believe that there is maturity in the Senate to conduct an inquiry like this very appropriately. For instance, Senator Tate was involved in a Senate inquiry into the conduct of a judge. He acted with maturity and on the basis of evidence in finding that there was a case to answer in the matter of Justice Murphy. If there was a select committee of the Senate on these terms of reference, we should expect maturity and the full forms of the Senate in the way in which that inquiry would be conducted.

I wish to look at the prima facie case in relation to one issue.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand Senator McMullan's answer. I also understand that he is trying to get out of answering my question. I am trying to ascertain whether the Government, or the property group in this case, made a wise investment in taking on that building for a lease. It looks as though Senator McMullan is not prepared to disclose that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On seeking information around Canberra, I have found that the average prime rental price in the CBD can range from $340 per square metre to $364 per square metre. The price can go up as high as $390 per square metre. It is very interesting to look at these figures because the Department of Administrative Services, say, four years ago was objecting strongly to paying $220 per square metre for offices in the CBD in Perth, and that was for a low square metreage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have also found out from my research around Canberra that rental increments are normally 7 per cent. The yield lies between 8 1/4 per cent to 10 per cent. I inquired specifically of the area where the Labor Party's building, which has been leased so conveniently to the National Audit Office, lies in Barton. The average rent for a new building is between $310 and $350 per square metre. The increment is 7 per cent and the yield is 8 1/4 to 10 per cent. Of course, this all depends on the quality of the building. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I disclose to the Committee that I have had a certain amount of experience in development&mdash;not with this size of project&mdash;and in obtaining tenants. I have never successfully obtained a government department; I have had to settle for people like Elders Ltd, ANZ Bank and that sort of ilk. From that experience, I have found that the more secure the tenant generally the lower the return will be on the dollar. I see that in relation to the building in Barton there is a yield of 8 1/4 to 10 per cent and an increment of 7 per cent, which is far short of the increment that is allowed in the contract. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have also discovered that the length of lease varies in a new building. One looks to try to get as long a lease as possible. It seems that the maximum lease one can obtain in Barton is 10 years with an extension of five or 10 years. In this case, the Department has signed a contract at a 2 per cent increment above the common rate. Being a high security tenant like the Commonwealth Government, one would think that the increment would be below the average of 7 per cent, not above it. The Government has signed a contract at 9 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McMullan will not tell me or give me an indication of the yield. That means that he is covering up the value of the building. It is no good the Parliamentary Secretary shaking his head. The Government has signed a first up lease of 15 years, which is unheard of. Someone has said that is akin to winning charities. I wish I could sign up a deal before I even got the project going with an increment of 9 per cent and with an unknown yield. If Senator McMullan will not tell me what the yield is, I presume that it is above these figures I have quoted here, that it is above the going rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did the Government do? When did it look after the interests of the taxpayers of Australia? Nowhere in my living memory&mdash;and that is a reasonable length of time&mdash;have I found where one can pick up a 15-year lease with a five year option with a highly secure tenant and a big increment. That would produce a very big return on one's money. I take it that it is a big return on the money because I cannot get any indication from Senator McMullan of the yield. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator McMullan should let me finish and then see whether he agrees with me instead of saying `No, no' and shaking his head as a few others do on the other side. He is agreeing with me that the Government has signed the lease for a term of at least five years above the norm. The normal term a property developer can hope to secure is 10 years with a 10-year option. I take it, by Senator McMullan's silence, that he is pleading guilty to signing a 15-year agreement, plus five years, which is far and above that which any private developer could hope to get in this city or any other city. I presume he pleads guilty to that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also presume that the Minister pleads guilty to signing a lease that returns to the landlord above the going rate. The yield on any property generally varies in inverse proportion to the risk taken and according to location. If one builds in Canberra, one expects a far lower return than if one builds out west of the Black Stump. Of course, there is a difference between building in Canberra, Sydney or Perth. One expects a return when one is secure in the knowledge that the tenant will pay rent at the end of the month. If my family company decided to put up a building in Canberra, then went around private industry in Canberra looking for a tenant, the tenants would say, `Your company is very secure in Canberra. Our money is fairly secure', and the return would be down. They would screw us further and further down. But here we have the Government signing a lease with an obviously far greater yield. By his silence the Minister has pleaded guilty to that. </PARA>

When one signs a lease agreement for longer than five years in Western Australia one has to register it almost as though it was a land transfer. Senator McMullan has not denied extending the term.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will return to yield. The yield to the Labor Party must be pretty good for Senator McMullan not to disclose it. Then there is the increment, and the security of having a tenant paying the money at the end of every month&mdash;or probably one month in advance, as it normally is. Perhaps Senator McMullan could tell us whether the rent is paid one month, three months or 12 months in advance. The increment is far greater than could be expected anywhere else.

On my quick whip around Canberra this morning I also found out that even with prime buildings in prime areas there is a holiday incentive. If one goes to Perth one can get holiday incentives in new buildings&mdash;not second-hand buildings or buildings that have been up for 10 years&mdash;of up to 12 months holiday. Of course, the Tax Commissioner made sure that he extracted his share of it. Even around Canberra there are some incentives with new buildings, such as fit-outs and holidays.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I query the deal that was made. I ask for some reconciliation between the deal made to locate the Audit Office in ALP House and other similar arrangements made in adjacent areas in Barton. I will touch very briefly on the ALP lease. The lease between the Audit Office and John Curtin Limited is to run for 15 years. The cost of $280 per square metre is retrospective to 1 January 1991 and is able to escalate at the rate of 10.5 per cent until completion and thereafter at the rate of 9 per cent for the balance of 15 years. In addition, the owner, John Curtin Ltd, has the right, I think at the end of five years&mdash;I do not have the papers with me&mdash;to go to market price and the rent then applicable would be the highest of the market price or the escalatable figure. I think Senator Panizza raised the point: is this a good deal or is it a normal commercial transaction with a query on it?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Barton there is another place called Tourism House. That building was recently let to the newly created Environment Protection Agency. This organisation has taken up three of the floors covering an area of about 3,850 square metres compared with, say, the 6,000 square metres for John Curtin Ltd. I would just like the view of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) on the comparison between the two. ALP-John Curtin Ltd has a lease of $280 per square metre, plus outgoings of $45,325; Tourism House has a gross rental of $306 per square metre. The escalation rate of rent at Tourism House is 3 per cent in line with the CPI compared with 10.5 per cent until completion and then 9 per cent for balance of the 15 years. Tourism House has two-yearly reviews to market&mdash;which is what I understood has always been the norm in the renting of premises by the Federal Government. Also, tenants are not responsible for all outgoings, as is the case with John Curtin, but for increases in rates of taxes over the base year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from the point I raised late last night about the propriety of an incumbent government even allowing government departments to go into premises owned by their own political Party&mdash;and that is a different matter which I hope will be the subject of further discussion later&mdash;was this a special deal or a normal commercial deal? I have pointed out here that we have two quite distinct leases, both of them involving government departments&mdash;one of them involving the Audit Office going into premises owned by the Australian Labor Party and the other one going into premises of which I do not know the owner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think the rentals themselves are a major problem. It is the escalation factors that apply over such a long period of time which can blow out the rentals to such an extent that, if inflation keeps down the way we all hope it does over the next five to 10 years, if we can entrench low inflation in this country, the Auditor-General or the Australian National Audit Office will pay rentals far in excess of that which everyone else pays in the city of Canberra. </PARA>

Why do we have a building which, on the face of it, appears to be more than generous&mdash;15 years and all those other things, which I will not go over again now&mdash;and then very close by premises which are somewhat similar although smaller in space? Normally, of course, the bigger the space the better the tenant, and the Australian National Audit Office would be a first-class, prime tenant.

The order also provides, however, that this limitation on debate does not prevent the moving of any amendment or request. On a strict interpretation of the order, an amendment or request which does not arise from a matter recommended for further consideration in an Estimates committee report may not be debated. This, however, whilst in accordance with the relevant order, would prevent an honourable senator explaining any amendment or request which he or she wishes to move. </PARA>

Nevertheless, it seems to me that we are reaching a situation where, if a senator has not made a reservation, he or she can get around that particular situation by then making a request and somehow fall within the Chair's grace in terms of being permitted to put questions and deal with matters which were not the subject of reservation. It seems to me that we are getting into a way of operating these Estimates committees whereby we are moving well outside the intention of those who tried&mdash;in order to save time and to give fair notice&mdash;to confine the Committee of the Whole to those matters which were unresolved in the Estimates committee meeting and which needed some further elaboration or proper answers to be given. That proposal came forward from the Committee on Procedure, of which the President was the Chair, in order to try to hasten the passage of the Appropriation Bills through the Committee of the Whole. Naturally, Mr Chairman, I accept your ruling, but I put in that cautionary note.

This is not covered properly in the Standing Orders.

The reason why it comes up at this time relates to a rather unusual circumstance in public administration, where funding from one particular department&mdash;which normally comes out of one allocation&mdash;is being switched to another department. For that reason, the money has moved across to the Estimates committees. It is a very unusual circumstance and it raises some very serious questions. Therefore, as the item of funding is located in this Bill, I would like to raise questions at this point.

I think the Department took that to be what she was asking for, in that some other dates are mentioned in the relevant paragraph on page E221. I think some examination could be undertaken of those dates, but it would take some time.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your recent letter regarding the impasse reached between Tasmania and the Health Benefits Council (HBC) recommended that I write a firmly worded letter to certain Tasmanian health insurance funds threatening them with the exercise of certain of my powers under Part VI A of the National Health Act 1953.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst I acknowledge that the conduct of HBC members may not be entirely exemplary, I consider the use of Part VI A procedures to be an over-reaction.</PARA>
<PARA>He means an over-reaction by Mr White. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is particularly so as those funds could rightly point to Tasmania's rather less than exemplary performance of its obligations under the Hospital Funding Agreement made pursuant to section 23F of the Health Insurance Act 1973 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Then it goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 4.3(c) of the Medicare Agreement requires Tasmania to ensure both that a patient is made aware of his right to be a public patient and that he makes an election to be either a public or private patient.</PARA>
<PARA>I am reading only parts of the letter. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am informed that the most blatant practice seems to be that of handing patients the proforma statement whilst asking them if they are privately insured. If they say they are insured, they are admitted as private patients without an election being obtained.</PARA>
<PARA>He says that he is advised that this is being undertaken in Tasmanian hospitals. That is the gist of it. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Medicare Agreement, the penalty for Tasmania's failure to fulfil its obligations under clause 4.3(c) is a reduction of its base grant equal to the benefits accruing to Tasmania . . . In the present case, I assume that would be a substantial part of those $300,000 you mention in your letter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In all the circumstances, I am of the opinion that in the interests of patients and contributors, this matter is best settled by negotiation between Tasmania and the HBC.</PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me that Tasmania was breaking the law in the way it was handling patients' elections as they went into public hospitals. The Minister will remember that I gave him my personal experience of going to hospital as an accident patient and not being given any opportunity to say how I wanted to be admitted into that hospital. When I said that I was privately insured I was automatically admitted as a private patient. Could the Minister tell me whether any action was taken against Tasmania in this incidence because it was breaking the law?</PARA>

It is a matter of trying to remedy the situation. It may have been that administrative measures were taken or suggested.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner Senator Tierney asked&mdash;I think this is a fair summary of his question&mdash;whether there was any double counting in the Appropriation Bills as funding for the John Curtin School of Medical Research was originally provided under subdivision 271.1, the Australian National University, and an amount was included in the general health research item, item 04 of division 330.4, to finance payments to the John Curtin School of Medical Research.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised as follows: there was no double counting. While there was no declared saving for subdivision 271.1, the increase in appropriation for the Australian National University in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) was lower than it would otherwise have been to the extent of the supplementation to be given to the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services to fund payments to the John Curtin School of Medical Research. DEET officials, who will be in attendance later this evening, will be able to give a breakdown of the increase in the estimate for subdivision 271.1, including this offset, if required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention by way of background that since the announcement on 17 December that funding for the John Curtin School was to be transferred from DEET to the present Department, payments to the John Curtin School have been made from the general health research item, item 330.4.04, and additional appropriation is being sought to cover the transfer in the Additional Estimates. As a result of these payments to the John Curtin School, there were insufficient funds in the health research item to fund the final quarterly payments for a range of research projects, including the John Curtin School of Medical Research, and as the payments met the criteria for funding from the Advance to the Minister for Finance, funding from the Advance was granted on 14 April pending passage of the Additional Estimates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, as the funding for the John Curtin School of Medical Research has now been completed for the financial year, blocking or amending Appropriation Bill (No.3) will have no bearing on the funding of that body as it would merely leave the payment for the health research item as a final charge on the Advance to the Minister for Finance. </PARA>

If Senator Tierney is satisfied, perhaps he could indicate; if not, perhaps the best course would be to defer his motion&mdash;unless it is absolutely related to this particular Estimates Committee&mdash;and discuss the matter with the official from the Department of Finance.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like the Minister, I am rather curious about this matter, particularly the offset figures. The Appropriation Bill shows that there is another $8m in the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services. If we go back to the original funding of the Department, we find that the figure in last year's Budget papers is $194.9m. When we come to the Bill now before us and the areas covered by the appropriations under Estimates Committee F, we find that the figure on page 32 is still $194.9m. In other words, there has been no adjustment from the end of last year to this year to the DEET figure, yet there is an adjustment of plus $8m in the health budget, being the half-yearly financing of the John Curtin School.</PARA></TALK.START>

I will just recall what they were: the amalgamation of the Canberra School of the Arts with the ANU required an extra $2.4m; additional funding in respect of research required $4m; supplementation required $1m.

That is the explanation, though I agree that it would have been better for the purposes of our Estimates Committee process had that been exposed and made clear. But apparently it is a Department of Finance opinion that, where the net effect of plus and minus adjustments to an appropriation item results in no additional estimates being sought under the item, it does not have to be explained in the way which obviously would have better satisfied Senator Tierney and Senator Short&mdash;and myself for that matter.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for that explanation. I must say that I find it a trifle strange that the figures that the Minister has just read out happen to add pretty roughly to the $8.2m that we are talking about. If what he is saying is accurate&mdash;and I am not questioning his integrity at all on this&mdash;I think that exposes some very considerable questions in the whole of the Estimates and financing and accounting processes because that, to my knowledge, is the first time we have heard of those figures. They are not insignificant; indeed, in some instances they are very significant figures, particularly for the institutions and agencies involved. It really does smack of, for want of a better word, creative accounting. I think that this Senate requires a more considered and detailed explanation of all of this than Senator Tate, very understandably, has been able to give us.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Tierney may be going to move into this area, so I will not say any more, but I think that some further explanation is required, particularly so far as this aspect is concerned. It appears that, under cloak of the ability not to have to disclose as much information as I think the Senate rightfully expects should be available to it, the net result of all of this is that there is an increase in the appropriations of $8.2m, when the explanation given in the performance statements for Estimates E is that the $8.2m is simply a transfer from one part of the accounts to the other. From what we are hearing from Senator Tate, that is not true and the actual fact is that there is to be, as a result of all of this creative accounting, an increase in the total appropriation of $8.2m.

Accordingly, provision for the transfer of $8.204m&mdash;that is, half-year funding for John Curtin from DEET to DHHCS&mdash;was included in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) at subdivision 330-4-04. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am further advised that no consequential decrease was made in the operating expenses of the ANU, appropriation 271-1, as a result of other variations.

The remaining difference of $1.8m was not shown in the savings document. This variation will be made to ANU's allocation for the second half of the 1992 funding year and reflected in the Budget Bills. Further funding adjustments, including a reduction for the remainder of the John Curtin School transfer, will also be included in the Budget Bills.

It seems to me that a reasonable comeback by Senator Tierney might well be, `Well, what is the evidence for overcrowding in the first year and is there overcrowding in terms of space available for first year students?'. The Department does not have any hard evidence on that. There is a lot of anecdotal evidence which points to a fairly patchy picture.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(Answers)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)The course in question was a station hand course conducted on Villadale Station, Richmond, Queensland. The training provider is recorded as W &amp; M Torenbeck. No contract was actually entered into with the provider for the conduct of the course.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Course places under the JOBTRAIN program are obtained by either contracting for the provision of entire courses or purchasing existing course places from TAFE and other training providers.

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In response to the ANAO comments on this process the Department acknowledged that it was inappropriate in the circumstances and remedial action was taken. The Area concerned has been given strict instructions in relation to the negotiation of training agreements and adherence to tendering guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Revised JOBTRAIN and tendering guidelines have been issued to all Areas to promote proper tendering practice. In addition, extensive staff training covering the seeking of quotes and tenders and appropriate documentation has been carried out.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)Revised guidelines on both JOBTRAIN and tendering, which form part of the CES manual, were reissued in 1991 in conjunction with extensive training in all States.

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need to maintain full documentation in relation to the evaluation and awarding of tenders and provider performance is addressed in these guidelines.

What have been the results of the data matching to date given that, according to the ANAO, the Department commenced data matching in April 1991?

The data matching has been started with the Department of Social Security and the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services. Of about 100,000 files, there have been investigations into 6,000. Those investigations relate to the size of the payment, the date of birth and the tax file number.

This is simply&mdash;I think it would seem to anyone who has had a look at it&mdash;gross financial mismanagement at worst.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister to what I said initially: that the Auditor-General could not express an opinion on the $80m of expenditure under this program and over a number of years has raised serious questions about the matter, evidently being assured each year that things had been fixed up. The Auditor-General is again saying that he cannot express an opinion on the matter. I would like to pursue the matter of the $80m a little further.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Department was asked for a breakdown by program of the $80m, the answer given was totally inadequate. We were told that $69m was spent on the Aboriginal education strategic initiative program grant payment and associated program support and that $11m was spent on the Aboriginal student support and parent awareness program. This supposed breakdown does not inspire confidence in the Department's adequate level of control over the funds that it manages. The information should have been more detailed. The amount of $80m appears as a line item in the DEET annual report with no breakdown answering such questions as: which schools are receiving funds and to what level; and how much money went to the States and Territories to develop their national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander educational policy and strategic plan? I ask the Minister to table in the Committee a more accurate breakdown to prove that DEET knows specifically what it is funding and at what level. </PARA>

How is it that the ANAO can make comments on the Department's financial administration such as, `a failure to ensure that rigorous standards are maintained in the accounting of public moneys' and `there is inadequate information supporting the processing of payments'?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think this question is meant to put me on the spot. As to its implications, DEET is an extremely large department. It has a huge number of programs serving different needs with different qualifications, a different client base and, in many cases, complex administration. I think the overall budget for the Department of Employment, Education and Training is in the order of $10 billion&mdash;which is not to be sneezed at in anyone's currency and, in this case, is quite a huge amount of money. I think too, as I understand it, that the Auditor-General himself is sympathetic to the difficulties such a large and complex department has.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">None of that is taken to mean that the Department is not serious about maintaining the highest level of internal audit management. But in an organisation as big as this, with such complexity and such a wide range of subprograms and programs, those observations made by the Auditor-General who meticulously reviews performance under each, while not treated in any trivial way, nonetheless, I think, are not to be regarded as exceptional. If we aggregated several departments we would probably be able to say the same thing about any one of them at any one time under any administration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I really cannot answer that question because I am not familiar with what the Auditor-General has said about all the other departments.

Some of it has been, I think the technical term is, `corrupt data'. It is as a consequence of that that the Auditor-General can make those remarks. It is as a consequence of the fact that the Department is progressively identifying and cleaning up this corrupt data and perfecting the system, that the Department can make its remarks.

As we understand it, the net effect of the successful passage of that amendment would be to reduce the $8.2m funding for the ANU. The reason for that is that, whereas we had believed that the request for the additional appropriation of $8.2m was to be offset by a corresponding reduction in the funding appropriation required for the ANU of $194.4m or thereabouts, contrary to that expectation on our part, the $8.2m which is now being transferred, so-called, to the Department of Health for the purpose of funding the John Curtin School has in fact been picked up in other ways, namely, as was said earlier, through additional requirements in respect of the amalgamation of the Canberra School of the Arts with the ANU. That is, an additional $2.4m; additional funding in respect of research, $4m; supplementation, $1m; and other minor requirements, such as Comcare charges, which altogether total approximately $8m&mdash;roughly the amount that was the subject of Senator Tierney's foreshadowed amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot recall the precise language that was used in the discussion, although I have a very clear recollection of the matter being raised by Senator Crane. I would be a bit surprised if my answer and Mr Marshman's answer were as categorical as Senator Crane has said. No doubt the record will reveal that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first comment I make is that, as was the case when the Estimates Committee met, so is the case now. There is a picket or an encampment, or whatever one might call it, of shearers protesting at what they refer to as New Zealand shearers coming into Australia and working below the rates in the pastoral award as contractors. They cite that the exchange rate difference between the New Zealand dollar and the Australian dollar means that they can still earn a reasonable income by New Zealand standards but work below the Australian award standards and thus there is an incentive for New Zealand based shearers to come here and do that. That was the situation back then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point is that to actually detect the number of people involved in this type of operation is difficult. One can look at the trans-Tasman immigration traffic and the growth in it. One can try to inspect each shed but that means that one has to be aware of when each shed is shearing and one has to be able to get there and check the time and wages book. It also means that in some cases more than one time and wages book is kept&mdash;one for the inspector and one for the worker&mdash;and there is a difference. So this is a practice for which it is very hard to gather provable evidence to secure a conviction. But I understand my Department, through its industrial inspectors, has inspected for compliance with superannuation payments fairly extensively around Australia, and it has done that in conjunction with the activities of State government inspectorates. In the course of that they have inspected rural areas to uncover any breaches of the pastoral award. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not quite sure what the results of that have been. I have it in my memory&mdash;I am not sure of how accurate this is&mdash;that there was a case uncovered which was rectified by the contractor or the farmer at the time it was established and thus did not go to court for prosecution. Frequently, when this sort of thing occurs it does not necessarily go the gamut of the legal process. Such matters can well be settled at the time. I am also aware of some actions taken by the AWU in inspecting for compliance with the award. I cannot be sure what the outcome of those actions are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth point I would make is that I think the anecdotal evidence is sufficient to establish a justifiable case. While there are fewer shearers because of a reduction in the flock and while graziers and family members sometimes do their own shearing because of the price of wool, nonetheless there has been a much greater reduction in the use of Australian shearers than one would expect because of those factors. When that is put alongside the anecdotal evidence, we are satisfied that there is a problem here. Whilst the dimensions are hard to define, it is nonetheless a real and significant problem. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I understand you to say that you had not had any requests to investigate any particular circumstances as far as shearing was concerned. Did I hear that right?</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not have any evidence that respondents to the national award are doing that.</PARA>
<PARA>I raise this matter because of the difficult position which currently exists in the Australian wool industry. Fortunately, it is not as difficult as it was 12 months ago and we can look forward to it improving once again this year. This is good news. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Figures have been quoted in the press that up to 42 per cent of the sheep shorn in Australia were shorn by New Zealand shearers. The only State about which I have been able to get information that I would regard as reliable is Victoria where the figure was 5 per cent and not 42 per cent. I think it is absolutely despicable, particularly in view of the answers I was given, that this matter has not been followed through further if this practice is as widespread as it is supposed to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Minister knows&mdash;and I declare an interest in this&mdash;the wool industry is a principal part of the operation of my family's farm, which is now run by my son. Some of the public utterances that have been made in recent times do not help the situation as far as the Australian wool industry is concerned. This is moving slightly off the mark, but a statement was made today that the Federal Labor Caucus has called on the Government to cancel arrangements which will allow New Zealanders to work freely in Australia. Once again, I find that situation alarming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a CER agreement between Australia and New Zealand. There have been some winners and some losers under that agreement. However, the bottom line is&mdash;and I think the Minister would have to agree&mdash;that Australia is better off because of that agreement. In my view, in recent years New Zealand shearers have made a very worthwhile contribution to the Australian shearing industry. Likewise, Australian shearers have made a very useful contribution to the New Zealand shearing industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These sorts of claims are not backed up by any hard evidence. They are backed by a Minister of the Crown, which gives them a public legitimacy but not a factual legitimacy. I can come very close to home on this&mdash;my son is currently working in New Zealand. A lot of Australians are actually working in New Zealand. I repeat that this attack has no hard evidence behind it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not personally have any argument with the situation outlined by the Minister in regard to complying with the occupational superannuation requirements.

In any event, I do not have any problem with that part of the award being upheld. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, if there is a problem with the award, I would request that the Minister and his Department should go out and investigate this matter properly. In fact, they should get hard evidence about what is occurring. I will not say that this practice is not occurring, but I can say that I have been unable to find any evidence of it, nor have I been given any information in that respect. I said at the last Estimates hearing that I had had contact with the National Farmers Federation and its affiliates with regard to whether or not they had been promoting this activity. I checked with the NFF&mdash;I did not go to the affiliates on this occasion. I was informed by the industrial officer of the NFF that the Federation had not been promoting it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for that explanation. He is technically correct that in some cases New Zealand shearers come here and are willing to shear for less than Australians. But that does not mean that they are shearing for less than the Australian award. There is no concrete evidence around that I or anyone else can find&mdash;unless the Minister can put it forward here&mdash;that they shear for less than the award. It is just as well that we had an influx of New Zealand shearers a few years ago to help us get over our shearing problems. The industry was having a problem getting the wool off the sheep at a time when it was producing over 1,000 million kilos a year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us get it quite straight: to my knowledge and to most people's knowledge, the New Zealand shearers are not shearing for less than the Australian award. The point is that they may be shearing for less than that which Australians want to shear. I believe that the New Zealand shearers have also introduced flexibility into shearing hours. If half a week, a couple of days or even a Friday is lost, I cannot see any reason why a shearer should not shear on the weekend to make up for it. New Zealand shearing teams also have no tendency to declare sheep wet that are dry. It is a good practice, especially about Friday lunchtime when there has been no rain for three weeks, to all of a sudden declare the sheep wet. The tendency of New Zealand shearers is not to do that. I am not saying that the majority of Australian shearers would do that, but quite a few would. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There could be many Australians shearing in New Zealand for part of the year. The Australian shearing season gets bogged down towards the autumn. It started spreading out the year round when sheep numbers were up around the 200 million mark and we were producing one million tonnes of wool. However, now that the numbers have been cut back, there is an Australian season and a New Zealand season, and shearers tend to flow backwards and forwards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose it is going overboard to say that there are just as many Australians in New Zealand as there are New Zealanders here. If the Department checked before it made any recommendation to cut out work visas for New Zealanders in Australia, it would be surprised to find how many Australians are working in New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New Zealand shearers have been blamed for the introduction of the wide comb into Australia. To many experienced shearers and experienced shearing contractors, if they do not already know, a good shearer does not shear with a wide comb any more. Senator Crane is an experienced shearer. He sheared for much longer than I did. He is also younger than me. He would have used the wide comb whereas I have not. More sheep cannot be sheared with a wide comb but can be sheared more easily. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A good Australian shearer or a good Kiwi shearer is only interested in shearing 200 sheep a day, and that is about it. The easier he can do that 200, the better it is for his health&mdash;and, for that matter, the sheep's health. The wide comb and the wider blows do it a lot easier. It has nothing to do with greedy shearers trying to do more than anyone else. Having listened to all these arguments on wide combs for about the last ten years, I thought I should put that on the record. </PARA>

It is my understanding that the Sydney centre had to do that by 30 June but the other centres, which started later, had to achieve self-sufficiency by their later dates, so they do not all uniformly come up to 30 June for self-sufficiency purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The boards of these centres make their own corporate decisions, and these boards have agreed among themselves to aggregate each of the centres and form a national centre&mdash;rather than have regional centres in each of the capital cities, plus the Hunter Valley&mdash;to obtain economies of scale, standardisation of training for their officers and a standardisation of service provision for their clients. In doing that, we have made provision for $500,000 which, as I understand it, just about sees out the appropriation that was made for all of the centres, if we took them altogether, in seeing through the terms of their original contract to complete self-sufficiency by their relevant dates. </PARA>

Subsequent inquiries from this officer revealed that he was referring to the termination, change and redundancy case, the decision in which was handed down on 2 August 1984.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to ask some questions in relation to Senator Macdonald's reservation with the TAAATS program. By way of introduction, I point out that TAAATS started off with the requirement for a proven off-the-shelf system with a minimum life cycle cost, to be supplied by a proven supplier of an air traffic control system. Those criteria were detailed in the ROI and repeated ad nauseam in the industry briefs that followed it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern relates to the unusual procedure that was followed for the selection of the preferred tenderer and the changes that took place along the way, because it seems that we ended up with the highest priced offer, the offer with the lowest Australian content based on a DITAC assessment, the only offering without a proven man-machine interface using current generation raster display technology. Based on the vendor's information that was supplied to the Public Works Committee on 21 May, we have accepted a new system, the EUROCAT 2000, which has not been commissioned anywhere. In justification for all of this we heard that the CAA management has asserted that it has selected the new system from Thomson over the recommendations of its selection panel of engineers and air traffic controllers because it represented lower risk. There are some questions that flow from that that I would like answered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the characteristics of the contract is the criticism that has come from the unsuccessful tenderers. The previous Minister for Shipping and Aviation said that there are always losers and losers always whinge, or words to that effect. I have been around here for a number of years and when contracts that were very much bigger&mdash;a whole magnitude beyond this $200m to $300m contract&mdash;were awarded. There was intense competition and there were some very disappointed losers. However, I have never heard the criticism that we are hearing now, both from within the industry and from the tenderers themselves who missed out. I draw attention to the series of letters which were written by the chairman of Siemens-Plessey when that company was eliminated in the early part of the contract selection procedure on grounds that are yet to be justified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hughes, a finalist in the program and a major company&mdash;a world giant with 63,000 employees&mdash;took the most unusual step of sending one of its senior vice-presidents, Mr Snyder, out here to appear before a Public Works Committee hearing. If one reads the transcripts of the Public Works Committee hearings, as I have, one comes to no other conclusion than that Hughes believed that it had been treated unfairly, and probably dishonestly, by the assessment process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence of the appearance by Mr Snyder before the Public Works Committee, a letter was written to Mr Butcher&mdash;a seven-page technical letter which I have in my possession&mdash;listing the shortcomings and difficulties in the program proposed by the successful tenderer. It is most unusual for contractors of the stature of Hughes and Siemens-Plessey to protest; but it is far worse than that because the chairman of Hughes in America, Mr Armstrong, actually wrote to the Prime Minister calling for an independent technical assessment of the tender bids. It is known that one of the three finalists, IBM, although it made no public protest, also had major reservations and protested to the CAA, both during the selection process and after it was over.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask: why was Siemens Plessey eliminated in the early part of the tender selection process considering that it made a bid of $103m, which was later reduced to $95m, and taking into account the technological expertise it possessed as a world leader in air traffic control systems?</PARA>

I am not sure whether it answers the honourable senator's question in the way in which he has put it, but I will just read this advice into the record:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following the evaluation of offers, the CAA advised Siemens Plessey that it did not wish to proceed with its offer and the remaining three companies&mdash;IBM, Hughes and Thomson&mdash;were invited to submit refined offers by 22 November 1991 with a view to the CAA selecting a preferred contractor and a runner-up by the end of that year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Siemens Plessey were fully debriefed on 9 October as to the reasons for the CAA decision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In brief, Siemens Plessey were advised that there was no single concern which caused their rejection but a set of concerns which, when put together, represented a risk that the CAA was not prepared to take.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The concerns advised were: flight data processing (FDP) development requirements and schedule; project management; systems design; elements of a technical systems offer; civil works.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Siemens Plessey made strong representations to the CAA expressing concern at the process and requested the project be cancelled. In essence, Siemens argued that the registration of interest procedure lacked any clear definition of the requirements involved and that the CAA should have used a `proper' tendering mechanism with a defined set of requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following a complete review of the evaluation process by a legal adviser to the CAA, the CAA board reconfirmed its decision to exclude Siemens from the process.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the advice that I have been given and I offer it as an answer to Senator MacGibbon's question. </PARA>

Surely, if the Minister was an experienced negotiator in contracting and had a tender from someone whose credentials are impeccable, in the way that Siemens-Plessey's are, at providing off the shelf, state of the art, air traffic control technology; and that company came in with a bid, as has happened, of $95m for the program; and the Minister had been publicly saying that the contract price he expected to receive was $300m&mdash;and the actual price he did receive from Thomson was somewhere around twice the bid of Siemens&mdash;would it not be prudent to keep Siemens-Plessey in the negotiations so that there was a financial benchmark against which to judge other tenderers? It seems to me to be the height of absurdity. Here was a bona fide tender from a company with all the credentials needed to fulfil the contract, which came in at a very competitive price.

Will the Minister ask his advisers to confirm that the Hughes bid was lower than the Thomson bid, the final bid, and will he ask them to confirm that the IBM bid was similarly lower than the Thomson bid?</PARA></TALK.START>

I treat with due gravity and seriousness the observations which Senator MacGibbon makes. While I have not yet dealt with this matter, I promise Senator MacGibbon that I will deal with it expeditiously and, I would hope, in a way in which all parties can say, whatever the outcome, the matter has been treated by the Government and by me in particular in the appropriate and proper way.

In that way it is not unproven or new technology; it is evolving technology based on earlier proven technology. Three of these systems will be delivered to different parts of the world before one is delivered to Australia. We will not be the first recipient of such a system. The FDP is based on a seventh generation Thomson FDP system, and again is evolving technology but evolving from a proven operational base. </PARA>

All of the documentation that came out from the CAA said that it had to be a proven off-the-shelf system, not a generation ahead or anything like that. It had to be off-the-shelf.

My understanding now is that the qualification was that the equipment would be based on systems as far as possible proven elsewhere. If I am right about that, we would not want to tie ourselves to a system that was an old model. We would want to be sure that we had a good, new model system, a system which was largely proven and developed and operational elsewhere. That is my understanding of that criteria. I will just ascertain whether my somewhat less than technical expression of the terms, nonetheless, conveys the true impression. I have just received a nod from an adviser who is sitting in the box; therefore, that is my advice, and I offer it to you as the explanation as to why the acceptance of the Thomson system was based on evolving technology but, nonetheless, a proven technological base.</PARA></TALK.START>

In 1988 Hughes lost a contract to do with air traffic control systems to IBM in the United States. It took the FAA to court over that and lost. What did the FAA decide? The parallels are quite extraordinary. It decided that in fact the Hughes system was technically either as good as, or superior to, the IBM product&mdash;there was a marginal difference. But, at the end of the day, the FAA decided that, on the question of developmental risk, it was safer to go with IBM than Hughes. Hughes lost the contract and the court upheld that decision.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not attribute it to Senator Calvert. Senator O'Chee made some quite extraordinary statements about the New Zealand air traffic control system. I have been in some dialogue with the New Zealand National Party Minister for Transport, Mr Storey, a person for whom I have great regard. I have found him to be a very reasonable person. He seemed to be very satisfied with the system that he is in charge of. It astonished me when the New Zealand air traffic control system was described as a `horrendous disaster' by Senator O'Chee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I went to New Zealand, had a look at it, and talked to every air traffic controller and technician that I wanted to talk to. They told me in some detail about the glitches that had occurred in the system when it was being commissioned and described them to me in detail. They said that they were delighted with the service Thomson had given. I think they said they had eight engineers present 24 hours a day while the system was being bedded in. Every problem that they had with the software&mdash;and no air traffic control system in the world does not have problems with the complicated software when these things are commissioned&mdash;was repaired. The controllers expressed themselves totally satisfied with the system. I was told that it had run glitch free for three months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I went to the Cairns tower. I spoke to the controllers at Cairns and the technicians at the Cairns tower. As I advised the Senate a few weeks ago, because of the tape recording equipment, they captured these incidents. They have analysed the data. They have in fact now prepared new software. All of the testing indicates&mdash;and it has been tested now for some three weeks&mdash;that they have actually fixed the problem. The new software is now in use in Cairns. It is not operational yet because it has got two more weeks of scrupulous testing to go before it is commissioned, but to this point in time I am happy to advise the Senate that it appears that the problem at Cairns has been fixed, as the controllers and technicians, I might add, told me they were confident it would be. </PARA>

I have just been there. If I am being snowed, do the country a service. Go over there and talk to your own colleagues about the system and come back and tell me, please, if there is a problem, because I will chase it up'. They did. Civil Air paid for one of its officers to go to New Zealand. Civil Air representatives came back to me three weeks ago, had a formal meeting with me, which was a meeting of record with departmental officers, and said, whilst expressing their continued personal preference for Hughes, `We went to New Zealand and what you were told is correct: the system is operating excellently; the controllers are happy with it; it is providing a very good air traffic control system for New Zealand'. All I am saying, with respect, is that that is a long way from the `horrendous disaster' that Senator O'Chee was quite happy to describe the New Zealand air traffic control system as being.

The New Zealand system is working and it is working well. However, the New Zealand system is old-fashioned and very small. It deals with a small geographic area. If one flies 60 miles in a light aircraft in New Zealand one goes a hell of a long way, and one flies at 3,000 feet. In Australia we have hundreds of light aircraft flying for four hours and six hours a day, getting up to 9,000 and 10,000 feet. The whole magnitude of what is involved in New Zealand is several times less than what is involved in Australia. The Minister should put it into perspective. If he is genuinely concerned about getting an air traffic control system into Australia in a hurry, why did he not select Hughes, Raytheon or Siemens Plessey&mdash;which would have come in years ahead of Thomson?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the argument that Senator MacGibbon has been so aptly and clearly making this evening ad infinitum, because it seems to be almost impossible to get it through the Minister's skull, is that, whilst a radar system is better than no radar system, we are seeking to have the best radar system. All Senator MacGibbon has been doing through the course of this very difficult debate, because the Minister has been deliberately uncooperative, is trying to get the best possible radar system. This Minister on the other side of the chamber is not interested in that. He wants to try to snow the Senate. Either he is trying to snow the Senate or he has been snowed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I regret the lateness of the hour. I welcome the opportunity afforded to me by Senator Knowles in her adjournment speech of last evening to respond to some of her concerns regarding the document I tabled on 27 May. I would first like to remind Senator Knowles of the context in which I tabled that document. My speech was supporting the ministerial motion on the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the referendum in which Aboriginal people gained the nominal rights of citizenship. I expressed a deep concern that 25 years have not achieved great progress for Aboriginal people. The racist basis on which this country was founded, namely, that of white supremacy and ownership of land regardless of the sovereignty of its indigenous people, has certainly not been eradicated from the attitudes and actions of our society to date.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The extremely serious problem of racist violence is still disturbingly active. I believe that racism is institutionalised in our society. It is reflected in our over-imprisonment of Aboriginal people; in the denial of adequate services in relation to health, housing and clothing; and, above all, in the failure to grant them rights of ownership over their own land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The responsibility for this does not lie at the doorstep of any one individual; each one of us must evaluate whether our actions contribute towards or attempt to challenge that institutionalised racism. In this context, I address the small component of this dysfunction in our community: the influence of talkback radio. The report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gambling on the First Race: A Comment on Racism and Talk-Back Radio&mdash;6PR, the TAB and the WA Government</EMPHASIS> was written by Steve Mickler, a PhD student at Murdoch University who has 10 years of involvement with Aboriginal affairs, both in Western Australia and the Northern Territory, and the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The study, which was done in conjunction with research associates Dr John Hartley, Dr Alec McHoul, Dr Alan Mansfield and Dr Tom O'Regan, emanated from the Centre for Research in Culture and Communication at Murdoch University. It was commissioned, published and paid for entirely by the Louis St John Johnson Memorial Trust Fund, set up by Mr Bill Johnson, whose son Louis was tragically killed in an act of racist violence. It has not taken one cent of taxpayers' money, which was a point about which Senator Knowles expressed concern last night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Mickler's report is a credible and legitimate critique of Howard Sattler's broadcasting style. It expresses in a clear and objective way the techniques and style of Mr Sattler's media performance, which have succeeded in alienating many Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal listeners. It is inappropriate for Mr Sattler to be outraged at his lack of right of reply when he has public access three hours per day, five days per week and a newspaper column. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In tabling the report, I believe I was fulfilling my democratic right to give voice to people's concerns and to endeavour to ensure Mr Sattler gives those views the attention they deserve. The fact that he is upset is a gratifying indication that he realises the seriousness of the criticisms. Mr Sattler's distress that, in his view he was being misunderstood, may give him an inkling of how many people who have been on the receiving end of his interviewing techniques have felt. In my opinion, the more positive attempts he makes to disprove accusations of inciting racism, the better it will be for public broadcasting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My radio interview on Howard Sattler's program on Friday, 28 May, which I believe Senator Knowles heard, represented a cameo performance which encapsulated all the criticisms contained in the Mickler report. Howard Sattler attempted to discredit me personally and devalue my views before, during and after my interview. References to the `unelected senator&mdash;nobody you voted for' need to be questioned not on their accuracy but on their motivation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A selective approach to the issues under discussion and an attempt to defend his own views led to a failure to listen or give a fair hearing to my opposing view. Cutting through and overplaying&mdash;the technology of having a separate channel so that he could interrupt halfway through my sentences&mdash;is also a technique that has been referred to in Mr Mickler's report; as was his continual interruption and arguing with me, in contrast to the non-interruption and positive feedback to callers with whom he usually does agree. Finally, he incited his supporters to ring my office and provided phone numbers for their benefit such that the phones rang constantly for a couple of hours. A tally of the calls revealed that 40 per cent of the callers he incited actually rang up in support of my position and to state a position for the people who could not otherwise be heard on his program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems of both racism and sexism is that very few people are consciously or deliberately racist or sexist. A common sign of racism or sexism is an angry, defensive response which refuses to acknowledge any validity to the criticism or to be concerned at any damage that may have occurred as a result of expressed views and behaviours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The notorious comment `Good riddance to bad rubbish' on the death of three young car thieves deserves some mention here. It is personally irrelevant to me whether Howard Sattler knew the race of the children or not. I find it outrageous that people speak that way of any human being, regardless of race. The Mickler report points out that it is a red herring for Howard Sattler to plead that he did not know that the race of the car thieves he referred to as `bad rubbish' was Aboriginal, for, according to Mickler, in Perth at this period the image of three kids in a stolen Commodore presumes them to be Aboriginal unless otherwise stated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if Howard Sattler did not understand it, the people in the public domain certainly did. A meeting of over 100 Aboriginal people two days later called on the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal to suspend Sattler from broadcasting and to carry out an inquiry into his comments. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SN5">Senator CHAMARETTE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am proceeding to that report and I would like to refer first to the complaints that were written in. These comments have distressed and outraged a great many Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people in our community. Some have commented that it is the worst breach of journalistic ethics ever, not to mention the callous absence of common decency. Apart from the enormous pain that these sort of statements caused family and friends of the children who died, they have the effect of inciting racial hatred, given that people in Perth were becoming aware that those who died were Aboriginal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reference to people as `bad rubbish' is strikingly similar to language used by racists to describe the ethnic minorities that are the objects of their hatred. For example, the Nazis called the Jews vermin. Although Howard Sattler did not identify the race of the children involved in the tragedy, the intent of his comments is no less deplorable and the effects no less dangerous and distressing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirty-one out of 40 complaints to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal between 1987 and 1991 concerned Sattler. None of these were upheld as breaching program standards. Mr Sattler may take refuge in these findings; nevertheless, the alternative view may also be expressed: that the test applied was at too high a level. I would like to quote from page 35 of this report. The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We find that each of the broadcasts in question was tasteless and likely to have been highly offensive to a significant number of listeners and, in particular, Aboriginal listeners. After careful consideration of the material available to us however, we find that the broadcasts do not satisfy the high test which we believe the word vilification imposes. Having found this, it was not necessary for us to consider the question of whether the vilification was gratuitous.</PARA>
<PARA>The report continues&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It appears to us that Mr Sattler has a controversial style of broadcasting which accounts for the regularity and frequency of the complaints elicited by the Sattler file.</PARA>
<PARA>Sattler is not the only Perth radio broadcaster to have attracted criticism for treatment of issues involving Aboriginal people. Peter Newman of 6PR, Eoin Cameron, Gary Shannon, John K. Watts and Barry Martin have also been the subjects of either complaints to the ABT or of critical analysis. Nor is the print media exempt. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> was unsuccessfully reported to the Press Council for the gang story mentioned earlier in this chapter. The report again states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my opinion, Sattler's comments were clearly made as part of a long history of widespread anti-Aboriginal media pressure against which the regulatory authorities have proved to be completely powerless.</PARA>
<PARA>I have no wish to cite many examples of concerns expressed in the Mickler report. Instead, I urge people to read and critique this document's validity for themselves. There is a need for the highest accountability possible in public broadcasting. Any attempt to offer a critique needs to be accepted in the spirit of freedom of speech and democracy, to which Senator Knowles made such frequent reference in her speech. Freedom of speech should weigh up the good of the community against the good of a few. Freedom of speech should not threaten the reality of a cohesive community. One should weigh up how divisive and how hurtful something is and whether it is an incitement to racial hatred. There are many examples in this report of how hurtful Mr Sattler's comments and style have been to members of our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I wish to state that there are other broadcasters who also receive criticism in this report. There are also those who have been commended, who have demonstrated greater objectivity and respect for diverse opinions. A 1984 study is cited on the different styles of the ABC's Des Guilfoyle and 6KY's Eoin Cameron. There are also broadcasters who do not receive a mention&mdash;some from 6PR, Mr Sattler's own station&mdash;who have actively tried to present a fair and compassionate hearing to their listeners. Two who are known to me and respected by me are Mr Graham Mabury and Miss Stephanie Woods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aim of the report and of my raising it in this Parliament is to encourage people with such a high responsibility of public broadcasting to ensure that their standards are at the highest possible level. For Senator Knowles to consider that a request for a non-racist, non-discriminatory policy in broadcasting constitutes a crude demand for political censorship is absolutely astounding to me. I make no apology to Howard Sattler, to 6PR or to Senator Knowles. If Howard Sattler and Senator Knowles have the right to express strong opinions, so do I and so do the people who find Howard Sattler's style highly objectionable and inciting fearfulness and racist attitudes. I am flattered that all the contents of the report are being attributed to me just because I agree with it and find it useful. The report speaks for itself and should be regarded as a valuable addition to a debate on constructive community attitudes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot let Senator Chamarette's further attack on freedom of speech go unanswered tonight. I cannot believe that Senator Chamarette can come in here and make a double-barrelled attack after the lack of foundation that she displayed last week when she admitted that she had never even listened to Mr Sattler's program. How can she be a judge of what he does or does not do? I would question Senator Chamarette's ability to judge a lot of things. She is a good judge about making the whole Senate sit here late at night&mdash;unfortunately she is not listening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should recall last Thursday evening when Senator Chamarette&mdash;again, she is not listening&mdash;voted at 10.32 p.m. for the whole of the Senate to remain in session and then promptly went home. She decided that she was going to absent herself from the Senate. There were four divisions&mdash;one at 12.04 a.m., one at 12.32 a.m., one at 1.08 a.m. and one at 1.36 a.m. Where was Senator Chamarette? She was tucked up in her cot at home, having voted for the Senate to remain here in session. If Senator Chamarette believes that that is a responsible attitude for a person who, as Mr Sattler quite rightly said last Friday, is an unelected senator in this chamber, then I'll go he. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, we have to look at Senator Chamarette's performance today. Given what she said last week in relation to the whole issue of racism, Radio 6PR and Mr Sattler and about wanting a clean and above-board structure on everything, it is interesting to look at the way she voted today&mdash;or yesterday afternoon, as it is now 1.15 a.m.&mdash;when there was a vote for a judicial inquiry into the Marshall Islands affair. An inquiry would get the whole thing out in the open so that the whole of Australia would know what happened in the Marshall Islands affair&mdash;the involvement of Senator Richardson, the involvement of Senator Evans, the involvement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and anybody else who might have been involved. What happened? We had a division. Where was Senator Chamarette? She lined up against the judicial inquiry because she does not want the truth to be exposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chamarette came in here again tonight and said, `We've got to enforce morality'&mdash;her kind of morality, whatever kind that is; I do not know and it is not up to me to judge. But what I do know is that her attack on a person who has the right to freedom of speech is just untenable. Yes, Mr Sattler does have a right of reply. Senator Chamarette has been here for only five minutes plus 30 seconds, in real terms; maybe she will find out one day that people who are attacked in this chamber have a right of reply and that maybe Mr Sattler will exercise that right of reply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I just want to put a few other things on the record because I alluded to them in general terms last night. I think it is important that the radio station in question is defended from the point of view of what it has done for Aboriginal people. These are but some of the things that Senator Chamarette has chosen willingly and intentionally to ignore, even though Mr Sattler pointed them out to her in the interview, the tape of which I had the misfortune to hear on Saturday. Radio 6PR's views on Aboriginal issues, I think, have been very high. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First and foremost, for the past 12 months 6PR has been conducting talks with the Western Australian Aboriginal Media Association, following its offer to that Association to train three of its cadets in year-long traineeships on all aspects of commercial radio. Following more recent negotiations, also involving the Department of Employment, Education and Training, this plan looks like coming to fruition within the next few weeks. This will mean that three Aboriginal media cadets will spend a year at the station learning all aspects of its operation. What a strange position for a racist radio station to take!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, 6PR was recently made aware of a young Aboriginal footballer, attached to one of the local Western Australian National Football League clubs, who cannot read or write. The station, after being approached by the club involved, agreed to assist with the young man's special education program. What a strange reaction for a radio station that Senator Chamarette alleges to be racist!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, Victor Patrick, a disabled Aboriginal health worker, was recently invited to attend a health conference in Canada for indigenous people, but was unable to gain funding from any Aboriginal body he approached for assistance. He then telephoned the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sattler File</EMPHASIS>. Within four hours the required funding of $2,000 had been raised to enable Victor to travel to Canada. What a strange reaction from a racist radio station and a racist broadcaster! In four hours of Mr Sattler's program, he had raised the money to enable Victor go to Canada. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, ongoing discussions have taken place with Phillip Moncrieff, Director of the Western Australian Aboriginal Media Association, regarding the possibility of setting up a group of Aboriginal spokespersons on whom 6PR's programs could call for informed comment when various Aboriginal issues were raised on air. Phillip has almost completed establishing a group of six spokespersons who would be prepared to participate, and a get-together with them is planned shortly. What a strange reaction for a racist radio station!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many other examples of what radio 6PR and Mr Sattler have been doing for the Aboriginal communities. What people like Senator Chamarette do is discredit the Aboriginal communities, which, as I said last night, do not associate themselves with the nonsense that Senator Chamarette has been going on about; they want to stand up and be counted and want to be judged for their own actions. They do not want some do-gooder saying, `Oh, because they did that and they are Aboriginal they must be forgiven'. The Aboriginal communities themselves do not want that sort of attitude. They want to be held responsible for their own actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The continued attack on both 6PR and Mr Sattler is amazing. Senator Chamarette said that it was amazing that Mr Sattler was upset. I think I would be pretty upset too if I were doing the things that Mr Sattler and Radio 6PR are doing and Senator Chamarette in the Senate under parliamentary privilege twice gave me a bagging for doing them and on neither occasion recognised the work that I was doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that is quite despicable. There was an opportunity tonight, if that had been overlooked by Senator Chamarette, for her to have recognised some of that good work, but she deliberately chose not to yet again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chamarette then said that, in the way in which Mr Sattler interviewed her on Friday, he attempted to discredit her; that he called her an unelected senator; and so forth and so on. That is quite right; that is just stating the fact. If there is something offensive about stating fact, if the honourable senator once again wants to gag freedom of speech by saying that he should not for some reason say she is unelected because she finds that hurtful or offensive, why not say so? It is absolutely amazing. Senator Chamarette felt she was not given a fair go on Friday. Is it any wonder? The evidence was actually stacked up against the nonsense she had spoken earlier in the week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chamarette fell into the trap yet again when referring to the `good riddance to bad rubbish' statement that Mr Sattler made. Of course, Senator Chamarette had to go one stage further tonight by saying it was irrelevant that Mr Sattler did not know at the time of making that statement that the people were Aboriginal. I do not think that that is irrelevant at all when subsequently Senator Chamarette and others have accused him of being racist by making the statement in the first place. Senator Chamarette knows that that was not known to Mr Sattler when he made that comment, yet once again tonight she has accused him of doing that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She then said that everyone presumed them to be Aboriginal. Obviously, Senator Chamarette's crystal ball is still in good working order because I cannot tell, and I do not believe anyone else can tell, what was in the minds of the people in radio land who listened to that comment as to whether they presumed that they were Aboriginal. I find that extraordinary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To substantiate that, Senator Chamarette said that there was a meeting of 100 Aboriginals the next day to protest at the fact that the statement was obviously directed towards Aboriginals. Of course, Senator Chamarette does not say that not long after that there was a meeting in Western Australia of not 100 citizens but 30,000 citizens who marched on the State Parliament House asking for tougher penalties for juvenile offenders. Whether they be black, white, blue or brindle mattered not. But here we have Senator Chamarette saying, `But 100 Aboriginals protested about the statement that Mr Sattler made because everyone presumed that he was referring to Aboriginals'. Senator Chamarette said that someone had said that Mr Sattler's comments were tasteless and perhaps were highly offensive&mdash;</PARA>

Having known Eoin Cameron for many years, I know for a fact that he is not a racist. We have a whole lot of other names such as Peter Newman and Gary Shannon. I could not write fast enough to get all the names down. They have all been drawn into the net. I suppose Senator Chamarette will turn around and say, `I do not listen to Eoin Cameron either' or `I do not listen to Gary Shannon either'. I suppose that is the reality of it.

If Senator Chamarette ever bothered to tune into 6PR or Mr Sattler, she would know full well that he is controversial. He is no real friend of the Liberal Party or the National Party at all, so I am not defending a friend in the political term; I am simply defending the right of a person to speak his mind and the right to freedom of speech, and not have some politician go into any parliament and seek to politically control what goes over the airwaves. That is entirely up to the listeners to decide. If they do not want him to be on air, or they do not want any other broadcaster to be on air, that broadcaster will be taken off. </PARA>
