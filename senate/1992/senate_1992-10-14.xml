<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of these instruments creates offences which may not provide the usual safeguards for those accused; another imposes fees for services by a public authority which are set at levels specifically designed to deter people from exercising their legal rights; while the third selectively withdraws financial concessions from users of a public service with no apparent recourse by those adversely affected. The Committee has asked for advice from the relevant Ministers. Mr President, as usual, I seek leave to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> a short summary of the Committee's concerns.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">EXPORT INSPECTION (CHARGES COLLECTION) REGULATIONS (AMENDMENT)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">STATUTORY RULES 1992 NO.251</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These regulations make all attendances by Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service officers chargeable, authorise requests for payment in advance, prescribe payment offices, amend particulars to be provided in returns and delete provisions relating to refund of charges.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Explanatory Statement advises that, with respect to payment of charges, payment in advance will be required from all but regular clients with a good record of payment on time. This may be reasonable in management terms, but it is a valuable financial concession and there is no reference in the Explanatory Statement as to whether there is a right of review of an administrative decision to the effect that a person does not have a good record of payment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, a regulation is omitted with the impact, noted in the Explanatory Statement, that AQIS will not refund charges in the future. No explanation is offered for this change to the rights of clients.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thirdly, there may be a problem with the drafting of the regulations. The Explanatory Statement, under the explanation of r.2B, advises that r.2B(2) provides that no refund of this charge is to be made regardless of the outcome of the application. However, there is no r.2B(2), nor is there any other provision to this effect. In addition, there is a regulation numbered r.2A(1) even though r.2A has only one subsection.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">EXPORT INSPECTION (SERVICE CHARGE) REGULATIONS (AMENDMENT)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">STATUTORY RULES 1992 NO.249</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Among other things, these regulations impose fees for applications for exemption from the Export Control Orders. The fees include a progressive increase in charges for services. Thus, a first service costs $75 a half hour or part thereof, with a minimum charge of $150; a second service costs $83.30 a half hour or part thereof, with a minimum charge of $250; and a third or subsequent service costs $83.30 a half hour or part thereof, with a minimum charge of $500.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Explanatory Statement advises that the progressive nature of the charge reflects the high costs in processing the applications from frequent users of the exemption provision, and acts as a deterrent to such use. There is no indication of whether any of the three levels reflects the actual cost of processing the applications. In any event, the charges are at least partially intended to deter users from exercising a legal right. In other words, the regulations impose a penalty for making use of a provision of the legislation. The Committee has asked the Minister for advice on this use of delegated legislation, which may breach personal rights.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">FEDERAL AIRPORTS (AMENDMENT) BY-LAWS No.1 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amending By-laws prohibit smoking in airport terminal buildings and create associated offences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The prohibition is largely enforced by smoking infringement notices. Anyone who is served with such a notice may elect either to pay an administrative fine within 14 days or else to have the matter dealt with by a court. However, one By-law provides that if an airport officer believes on reasonable grounds that a person has committed offences by not answering questions or complying with directions, then the officer may serve a smoking infringement fine upon that person. Upon being served with a smoking infringement fine a person must pay the fine immediately.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee believes that the smoking infringement fines may breach personal liberties. In the context of airports and flying out of jurisdiction, it may be reasonable for such fines to be paid immediately. However, the provisions appear not to include such safeguards as specifying the consequences if a person is unable or unwilling to pay the fine. The Committee assumes that these matters are dealt with elsewhere in the Act or other delegated legislation, and has asked the Minister for advice.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have great pleasure in introducing this Bill to the Senate. My particular pleasure derives from the fact that this Bill provides for further measures to assist frail older people in our community, and particularly their carers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Government's aged care policy pays particular attention to the needs of carers. The Home and Community Care Program lists carers as a special target group for the program. Our residential care program makes special provision for respite care to enable carers to have a break from time to time. This Budget proposes a package of assistance to carers amounting to $89 million over 4 years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of these measures concerns an increase to the Domiciliary Nursing Care Benefit (DNCB). This Bill contains provisions which, if passed, will enable implementation of that Budget announcement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The DNCB provides financial assistance to carers of people over the age of sixteen who have been assessed as needing nursing home level of care. Part 5 of this Bill includes amendments to support three changes to DNCB to take effect from 6 January 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first amendment will increase the level of the Benefit by $10 to $52 per fortnight from 6 January 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second amendment provides for the Minister to vary this amount from time to time. It is the Government's intention to index the Benefit annually on the basis of CPI changes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The third amendment will allow carers to continue to receive the benefit during periods of respite care of up to 42 days a year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The significant increase of the Benefit by approximately 25% and its subsequent indexation, demonstrates the Government's commitment to the recognition and support for carers of frail older people and people with disabilities living in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The continued payment of the Benefit while the person being cared for is in respite care will provide much needed support for carers and allow them to have short breaks from care without loss of benefit. This provision will bring DNCB into line with provisions applying to similar payments in the Social Security area. Respite care is the service most highly valued by carers.  The Bill also contains amendments concerning funding for new and rebuilt nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of a decision in the 1991 Budget, the Government already provides additional recurrent funding for some nursing homes that are newly built or completely rebuilt. The aim of this initiative was to improve the quality of nursing home buildings, and hence to improve the quality of care.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The nursing home industry took the view that this initiative would not efficiently meet its objective, since a proprietor could only apply for the additional funding after building the new home. They said that a proprietor considering rebuilding his or her home needed an assurance of the additional funding before construction commenced. Otherwise, he or she would not be able to borrow the money to rebuild.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendment overcomes this problem, and introduces a system of Approvals in Principle.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recent Budget provided funding for Approvals in Principle for 1992-93 and 1993-94. However, it is possible that many proprietors who do not intend to rebuild their home in the near future will nevertheless apply for an Approval in Principle, just in case they change their minds, or in case the State Health Authorities force them to rebuild. There is therefore a risk that the available Approvals in Principle will be wasted. To avoid this possibility, this legislative amendment allows the Approval in Principle to be revoked if no progress is made towards the rebuilding. The Approvals in Principle will then be able to be re-allocated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill makes provision for a change in date of effect of reviews of resident classifications.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the current funding arrangements for nursing homes, the proprietor applies for a classification for a new resident, or for a current resident whose classification is about to expire. This classification is based on the Resident Classification Instrument (RCI) which measures a resident's need for nursing and personal care. These classifications are used to determine the amount of funding for nursing and personal care that a home receives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In deciding whether to grant a classification, the Secretary of the Department is guided by Principles formulated by the Minister, known as the Nursing Home Classification Principles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Secretary of the Department may at any time review the classification of a resident. If, on the basis of this review, the Secretary decides that the resident has been wrongly classified, the Secretary may revoke the classification and substitute a higher or lower classification.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently, the Secretary is not required to have regard to the Nursing Home Classification Principles when reviewing a resident's classification. This is an anomaly, because the purpose of the Classification Principles is to ensure that all resident classifications are determined by classification principles which are universally applied, according to relative care need.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Therefore, this Bill proposes to amend the Act to require the Secretary to observe the Nursing Home Classification Principles, when reviewing a resident's classification.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There exists a further anomaly in regard to reviews of classifications. If the review classification is lower than the original classification, the review classification currently takes effect from the date of the review. This is despite the fact that the wrong classification has applied from the date of the original classification.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill proposes to amend the period of effect of a review by the Secretary so that the review classification is for the same period as the original classification.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This also means a nursing home will not have as long to wait for a further review of the classification. At present, in the case of a reduced classification, the nursing home has to wait until the review classification has been in force for twelve months. This can be up to one year after the original classification would have expired and delays the opportunity for the nursing home to seek a further classification in cases where the resident's care needs have changed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendment will mean that the nursing home will receive a positive or negative adjustment to future funding depending on whether the review classification is higher or lower than the original assessment by the nursing home. This will ensure an appropriate level of funding for the entire twelve month classification period. The nursing home will be able to apply for a further annual classification at the end of that time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill ensures that the new arrangements applying to the period of effect of a review classification, if that review lowers a category, will apply only to classifications determined on or after the date of assent to the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also makes amendments to the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act designed to increase equity with regard to hostel subsidies by providing higher subsidies for Financially Disadvantaged Persons (FDPs).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments provide for an increase in funding for each FDP hostel resident, offset by a reduction in funding for non-FDP hostel residents who have been assessed for Personal Care (PC). It is intended that at all levels of care within a hostel there will be a $3.20 a day subsidy difference between FDP and non-FDP residents. Hostels have a greater capacity to raise income from their non-FDP residents through avenues such as entry contributions and variable fees. These options are generally not available for hostels catering for FDPs.  This can present problems in ensuring access for this group and viability problems for hostels catering predominantly for FDPs. Thus the amendments will benefit hostels accommodating Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and other disadvantaged groups.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recently introduced hostel personal care arrangements are based on the assessment of the relative care need of each individual, not their financial status or capacity to pay&mdash;this principle is unchanged. Those with higher care needs will continue to get higher subsidies. However, the subsidy at each level will also reflect the financial status of the resident.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While some hostels will be disadvantaged in terms of subsidies available, the extent to which hostels will be affected will depend on the financial status of the residents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As already indicated, hostels with high levels of non-FDPs have access to higher levels of resident charges. The real impact on the resident and the hostel should be minimal, as the changes, in combination with forthcoming real increases in pensioner income through pension and rental assistance increases, largely offset each other.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The overall impact is that the income available to hostels from subsidies and resident payments will be better targeted to support those in need.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to amendments to the aged care area the Bill makes amendments to the arrangements regarding payment of Medicare Benefits in relation to R-Type Diagnostic Imaging Services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment of subsection 16B(11) of the Health Insurance Act provides for the extension by two years, to 1 January 1995, of the "sunset" provisions. Under the current "sunset" provision, from 1 January 1993, Medicare benefits will no longer be payable for diagnostic imaging services rendered by medical practitioners who were exempted by the "grandparent" provisions in the 1991 amendments dealing with "arms length" requesting of these services. An extension will allow for the continuation of the payment of Medicare benefits for R-type services in these circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments proposed will provide more time for the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners to develop accreditation guidelines for general practitioners who provide radiology services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also amends the Medicare Benefits referral arrangements by inserting a new section 20BA in the Health Insurance Act. The main purpose of the proposed amendment is to require that where a practitioner refers a patient, in writing, to a consultant physician or a specialist and where the physician or specialist renders a specialist medical service to that patient, the physician or specialist must retain the referral for a period of 18 months. The amendment also proposes that the physician or specialist be required, if requested by the Managing Director of the Health Insurance Commission, to produce to an officer of the Commission the referral or the patient's hospital records for verification of a referral.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following discussions between the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services and the medical profession, agreement was reached on revised referral arrangements. This included placing onus of proof that a valid referral took place on the specialist or the consultant physician (ie the practitioner to whom the patient was referred) rather than the referring practitioner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Precedents for the proposed amendment already exist in the Health Insurance Act in respect of requests for pathology and diagnostic imaging services including the requirement that the referral be retained for a period of 18 months.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill rectifies an error in subsection 129AAA(3) of the Health Insurance Act. The amendment to the subsection omits the second occurrence of the word "pathology" before "practitioner" so that the subsection prohibits an Approved Pathology Practitioner from providing nursing and other staff not only at the premises of the practitioner but also at premises made available to the practitioner by a medical entrepreneur.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also reinserts subsection 79(5) in the National Health Act to allow for the cancellation of registration of organisations where the business of all health benefits funds conducted by them have been transferred, in accordance with an approval by the Minister, to funds conducted by other organisations. Subsection 79(5) of the National Health Act was inadvertently repealed by the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Act 1989.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments of section 4 the National Health Act in Part five of this Bill relate to the payment of Medicare benefits for visits by participating optometrists to private patients in hospital and approved day hospital facilities. Currently where a visit is made by an optometrists to such patients the Medicare rebate is 75 per cent of the Schedule fee with the health insurance funds required to cover the remaining 25 per cent for insured patients.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the 75 per cent benefit rebate is contained in the Health Insurance Act it is linked to the professional service rendered to patients who are receiving hospital treatment as provided for in the National Health Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the Health Insurance Act was amended in 1987, to reduce the Medicare benefit for professional services rendered in a hospital, or approved day hospital facilities, to private patients from 85 per cent (maximum $20 gap) to 75 per cent flat, its unintended application to optometrical consultations was over looked.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Patients are not admitted to hospital for conditions requiring the services of an optometrist. An optometrist may visit a hospital as a social service to a patient who has broken his/her spectacles and requires a test for new spectacles. Such patients are most likely to be long stay nursing home type patients. The 75 per cent flat rate benefit provides a disincentive for optometrists to bulk bill such patients, the majority of whom would be aged persons. Currently some 87 per cent of optometrical services are direct billed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposal in this Bill is to amend subsection 4(1) of the National Health Act to exclude optometrical consultations from the definition of professional service for the purpose of that section and as a consequence from the application of the 75 per cent Medicare benefit level provided for in Section 10 of the Health Insurance Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also closes a loophole which would enable a child, in respect of whom family allowance is not being paid because of the income or assets test, to be declared a disadvantaged person and thus be issued with a Health Care Card and receive pharmaceutical benefits at the concessional rate of patient contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the Bill makes a number of minor changes and corrections to the legislation governing the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill seeks to remove sales tax exemption which was granted to certain recyclable papers in 1989. Some goods made of wholly recycled paper will now become subject to sales tax, while others will remain exempt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that when the exemption was introduced in 1989 I warned that the legislation then was distorting it and that it went against an Industry Commission interim report which established that recycling was not automatically environmentally friendly and that there were not clear definitions or measures. Unfortunately, this is still the position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, the coalition supports this Bill. In the Bill the Government acknowledges that the exemptions introduced by it in 1989 have failed to fulfil their stated purpose. I remind the Senate, as this is an appropriate occasion, that the Fightback proposal to abolish the wholesale sales tax and other taxes and replace it with a uniform goods and services tax also has the effect, as from 1 October 1994, of removing the exemption, because it will create a level playing field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1989, when the exemption was granted, the Government actually chose to ignore the interim report, coalition warnings and the subsequent full Industry Commission report on paper recycling. The predictions have proved to be correct and we now see the Government seeking to address the problems which it created. The previous decision to exempt certain 100 per cent recycled paper products from sales tax was taken largely from misplaced environmentalist ideals with no prior consultation with the mainstream industry. Mr Baldwin, the Minister Assisting the Treasurer, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following from the Industry Commission's report on recycling, the Government has decided that the sales tax exemption would remain but be narrowed to address the problems that have arisen and to direct better the measure to environmental concerns. For example high quality waste paper is used in the manufacture of tissues and paper bags which cannot be recycled again. This high quality waste paper could be used in other products such as writing papers, which can now be recycled several times.</PARA>
<PARA>This was the essence of the warning that we on this side of politics delivered in 1989 on the basis of the industry predictions in the interim report. But at the time the Government chose to ignore the interim report and has now fallen back on the full report which has come up with the same conclusion. The trouble is that, in the meantime, industries have actually grown up on the basis of the exemption which had existed. That is not surprising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For these reasons, which I shall detail in a moment, the coalition, while supporting the removal of the exemption&mdash;because that was our original contention&mdash;also supports the introduction of a bounty which will compensate the industries which have developed on the basis that the exemption was going to ensure their viability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the proposed legislation as it now stands, the following three items made from 100 per cent recyclable paper which were exempt will become subject to sales tax: books of blank, lined or graph paper used for writing or drawing; toilet tissue and facial tissue; and paper bags marketed for household purposes or for use in the marketing of goods sold by retail. However, the following products will remain exempt from sales tax&mdash;and I think it is important to note the distinction: writing and drawing paper, pads of writing and drawing paper, paper for use in accounting ledgers and  journals, and envelopes. The removal of the exemption is expected to result in a gain to revenue of $11m in 1992-93 and $12m in the next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Approximately 900,000 tonnes of paper are recycled in Australia annually. This is a not insignificant figure. It amounts to just under 33 per cent of the paper used each year. The general recovery rate of paper products for recycling was just under 31 per cent. I think this exposes as myth the theory that recycling is new and only a small component of the total paper usage in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission report indicated that, while no tissue products were recycled because there is not the length of fibre to give the required strength to the recyclable product, printing and writing papers made from recycled paper were often used again because of the strength of the tissue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The executive director of the Pulp and Paper Manufacturers Federation of Australia is reported as stating that in 1990-91 nearly 45 per cent of the fibre materials used to make paper came from waste paper. This figure is expected to rise to 53 per cent by 1994-95. Australia's performance in recycling is good by world standards and will be rated very good as recycling in general increases when the recycling of more newspapers and magazines is carried out in the new de-inking plant at Albury and Shoalhaven, currently the subject of an environmental impact statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's current recovery rate of waste paper is about 37 per cent; and it is expected to rise to 43 per cent in 1995 when the Albury plant is operating. For a country which has large imports of paper, this is a very good performance compared with countries such as the United States, Germany, the UK and Sweden. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A spokesman for the Australian Conservation Foundation has indicated that the use of recycled paper has increased since the introduction of the exemption from 3 per cent to 90 per cent in respect of exercise books and from one per cent to 9 per cent for toilet tissues. This must be seen as a good thing for our industry and our environment and it must not be taken away by changes in sales tax law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one would deny the desirability of the efficient use of resources and protecting the environment or the desirability of the theoretically economic and environmentally friendly use of recyclable products. However, the situation that we have before us at the moment is not all that simple. The Democrats are assuming, quite naively as they sometimes do, that any recycling must really be best for the environment. Unfortunately, in terms of priority, the concerns of industry and jobs for Australians are placed well down the agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can understand how many people of goodwill believe that an exemption such as the one we have before us will lead to increased recycling of waste paper. While there has undoubtedly been an influence in that direction, the outcome for Australia has not been economically favourable. Also, it is not clear whether the outcome of the exemption, if pursued to its popularly desired conclusion&mdash;that is, more recycling&mdash;is always environmentally sound or friendly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, the Government has discovered to its pain that it is not a simple matter of recycling paper and creating benefits for the environment, because there are some problems. A number of factors make some recycling economically and environmentally costly. The first of these, which is indicated in the Industry Commission report, is the de-inking process. This process itself creates salt problems, particularly in inland areas. Chemicals in waste paper become concentrated when recycled, and the process itself requires chemical usage. This matter of whether all recycling per se is ultimately best for the environment is an important consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A second important consideration is what I refer to as cost efficiency in pure dollar terms. When considering both the environmental cost and the dollar cost, it must be noted that the recycling of paper is also not necessarily energy efficient. Each operation must actually be examined on its merits. Because of collection and sorting costs and the attendant energy requirements, it is in some cases more efficient to use virgin paper or fibres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission report warned that the introduction of the discriminatory buying policies and tax concessions for recycling mandated targets purely to promote recycling would instead increase costs to traditional paper recyclers and increase imports of recycled paper to satisfy the regulations. This would be an unfortunate side effect. But that is exactly what has happened. For example, APM, which manufactures paper bags, used 40 per cent recyclable paper long before recycling became a trendy notion. But it has been undercut by imports which purport to be 100 per cent recycled paper to attract the sales tax exemption. The important words are `purport to be', because this is where the difficulty lies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to economics, the exemption has fostered a surge of imports of paper products claiming&mdash;this is difficult to identify because of the massive quantities of pulp&mdash;to be 100 per cent recycled. This is not necessarily the case. Unfortunately, the local production of some paper products has been adversely affected. The hard fact of life in this recessionary environment is that up to 400 jobs could be lost unless the Government's decision to remove the exemption is maintained. Naturally, we thank the Government for saving those jobs through this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To make matters worse, there is no known technical method of analysing the recyclable fibre content of paper and therefore no way of knowing whether these imports actually contain 100 per cent recyclable fibres. Even if they do, a principal outcome of the exemption has been to increase recycling in overseas countries and not in Australia. In the longer run, if regulation or taxing instruments force more recycling, the quality of many Australian-made paper products will decline because of the decreasing availability of good quality waste paper. This will lead to an even greater penetration of imports which are not similarly constrained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary on this point, there is a very significant problem in that there is no way to substantiate the claims and it is doubtful in some cases whether all of the 100 per cent recyclable material is fibre. We have a situation where imports of dubious status have been able to undercut Australian products. That is just not on. An added problem is that there is an anomaly in the definition of recyclable paper, which allows paper made from all virgin fibres to be defined as recyclable paper because of the normal breaking down process used in paper manufacturing. Paper mill broke, the technical term for paper that does not meet quality standards and never leaves the mill but which is then pulped, can be counted as recyclable paper and can even attract the exemption, under the definition we have. There is a problem with the definition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A final problem with the concept of the definition is that from an environmental perspective it is becoming clearer, as scientists examine the full environmental impact of recycling, that recycling for its own sake may not provide the best environmental outcome in terms of emissions of greenhouse gases. Recycling, like all other industrial processes, consumes non-renewable energy and generates carbon dioxide, both in its production and in the transport of waste paper to processing plants. The whole recycling process has to be compared with the production of paper from virgin fibres to determine which is the most favourable, taking into account life cycle considerations of all the environmental parameters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For these sorts of reasons, the exemption should never have been introduced in the way it was. The products that will continue to attract exemption are those that can be repeatedly recycled with environmental and economic efficiency. The problem that now remains, having identified that the exemption never should have been allowed and that there are complications with it, is that paper manufacturers are divided as to the effects the changes will have on their operations. A primary consideration for the coalition was the concern that a number of companies had relied on the exemption in making investment and management decisions. For them, the Government's withdrawal of the exemption without giving those companies any time to adjust is quite unreasonable. Investments have been made and operations commenced on the basis of the exemption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the best illustrative point is to quote an operator, Austissue Pty Ltd in Western Australia, which could have stood to lose a great deal unless its particular problems were addressed. For example, Austissue, which commenced operations in September 1989, is the company that introduced tissue made from 100 per cent high grade waste paper in Australia. That is very commendable. Subsequently, other manufacturers have started producing recyclable tissue products, but I believe Austissue remains the only manufacturer exclusively producing 100 per cent recyclable tissue products. Austissue's operation involves four stages: waste paper collecting and sorting; paper manufacture of jumbo rolls; conversion of jumbo rolls to finished product; and sales and marketing of both jumbo rolls and finished product&mdash;for example, toilet rolls and facial tissues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The particular needs of this company and any other in the same situation must be addressed with a great deal of consideration and care. In relation to the timetable for the granting of the exemption which is now to be removed, in July 1989 the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) announced that certain 100 per cent recycled paper products would be exempt from sales tax and the legislation was proclaimed in January 1990. Shortly after this time all State governments announced various measures in support of recycled products. In the main, these measures revolved around two key elements: firstly, the collection and re-manufacture of recyclables; and, secondly, government purchase of recycled products. Quite a number of the envelopes and pads used by senators in this Parliament come from recycled products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since that time, the Federal Government has made several pronouncements confirming its commitment to the environment and recycling. Recent examples were the Prime Minister's address at the launch of the waste minimisation and recycling strategy on 22 June 1992; the environment summit in Rio de Janeiro; and a letter from the then Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories to the Australian Conservation Foundation in September 1991 stating that she would oppose an amendment of this nature. There was then what is known as the `Be Smart' recycling campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The intention to lift the sales tax exemption on certain recycled products which has been set up on the basis of these moves is inconsistent with the Government's publicly stated position&mdash;unless there can be some additional measure, such as is proposed, to ensure continuing viability of these measures. The Government should continue to exempt, or in some way subsidise as we have proposed, all paper products made from 100 per cent recycled paper, providing it is post-consumer waste&mdash;that is, it has already been used for its primary purpose prior to being recycled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Typically, the waste paper used by Austissue to manufacture tissue already had sales tax paid on it in its original life. In line with the Government's policy, the directors of Austissue have committed the company and all of its resources to pursuing exclusively the manufacture of 100 per cent recycled tissue products. The imposition of what is effectively a 20 per cent price increase on its product naturally has very serious consequences for its viability and its future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When delivering his second reading speech, the Minister Assisting the Treasurer, Mr Baldwin, whom I quoted earlier, was not technically correct in saying that each time paper is recycled the paper is partially degraded. The contention that paper can be viably recycled only `several times' is not quite correct, as a certain content of new long fibres which have not been shortened in the recycling processes is needed. In addition, approximately 40 per cent of the waste paper used by Austissue is not considered suitable for the manufacture of printing and writing paper. To date, the manufacturers of recycled printing and writing paper have been reluctant to take previously recycled paper for re-manufacture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the reason why the Government seeks to lift the exemption on toilet and facial tissues is its concern that recycled products are being imported into Australia and there are strong reasons to believe that most of those products do not conform to any reasonable definition of recycled. The production of tissue from recycled materials is in its infancy in Australia. It has been said by the Prime Minister on talkback radio that a window of opportunity was provided and now, after two years, it has given the industry adequate time to establish itself. It should be noted that a majority of businesses fail in the first three years and it takes five years to achieve any reasonable level of maturity. It is also a fact that at the same time the window of opportunity was opened, the economy entered the most severe recession in 60 years and interest rates reached abnormally high levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the rationale for allowing the exemption, misplaced though it turned out to be, was to provide a domestic recycling industry and the attendant jobs and services it would require. Another significant reason was the Government's commitment to substantially reduce the amount of paper going to land-fill refuse sites. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Austissue has invested around $7m, or possibly more, to take advantage of the current sales tax exemption and claims it will lose that investment and need to lay off 40 staff in the event of the tax preferred arrangement being removed. Austissue and several other companies committed themselves only on the basis of the Government's policy of sales tax exemption for their products. These industries are not demanding subsidies but a set of rules which are predictable and workable under which they can operate, and that is not unreasonable. There will be a resultant increase in unemployment from the moving of the goalposts, and the coalition is recommending and supporting a bounty system which will encourage and enable the degree of recycling which is operative in these situations to continue and help to offset the effects of the rule change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to indications that the coalition may oppose the legislation, the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) approached the coalition suggesting that the Government could meet the concerns through a special purpose payment to the relevant State government&mdash;for passing on to the producer&mdash;equal to the estimated wholesales tax on the product of the producer in the year ending 30 June 1992 that would have been payable had it not been for the sales tax exemption. So it is expected that the Government will extend this arrangement to let it run down over a couple of years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, companies such as APM are requesting that the exemption be removed so that the 20 per cent tax on recycled brown paper bags will bring them into line with white paper production. The APM situation highlights the problems with the original legislation and demonstrates the need for the removal of the exemption. APM is the only manufacturer of these paper bags in Australia and contends that it is unable to manufacture 100 per cent white paper bags due to the technical properties of Australian white paper. APM has indicated that this business, amounting to $20m worth of sales per annum and involving the employment of between 44 and 60 Australians directly, has been put on hold pending the removal of the sales tax because of the so-called 100 per cent recycled paper bag imported from various overseas countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within the 570,000-plus tonnes of post-consumer wastepaper which APM uses in the manufacture of paper products in Australia, a considerable volume is white recycled paper. This waste grade, regardless of the sales tax situation, is in short supply and is used for the manufacture of folding carton boards, white lined corrugated boxes, envelope paper, photography paper, forms and listing paper. The high content of short eucalypt fibres makes the wastepaper unsuitable to give the manufactured bag its necessary tear strength. This means that the Australian white wastepaper cannot be used in this process. This contention by APM has been confirmed by the CSIRO Division of Forest Products, and it has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . mixed white wastepaper collected in Australia is not suitable for 100% recycling into bag papers. The strength results (in APM tests) are entirely reasonable, as mixed white wastepaper in Australia is dominated by writing and printing grades which have relatively low strength requirements.</PARA>
<PARA>The National Association of Forest Industries Ltd has expressed support for the Bill on the grounds that a number of Australian companies have lost a substantial share of the market for recycled paper products because of the surge of imports attracted by the sales tax exemption. This in turn has put at risk a number of jobs in the pulp and paper industry. Australian Paper Mills has indicated, as I mentioned previously, that it could shed up to 44 employees if the removal of the sales tax exemption as proposed in the Bill does not go ahead. But I believe that with the support of the Opposition it will now go ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, the sales tax exemption on recycled paper should never have come into existence, and naturally must go. But the industries which have developed on the basis of the measures which were introduced should not suddenly have the rug pulled out from under them and should be given some consideration. It is for this reason that the coalition is suggesting that a bounty be offered to offset the cost of the sales tax exemption, to be gradually phased down as the industry naturally becomes more established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes which the Government has introduced in this piece of legislation reflect its casting around for a mooring in the whole sales tax area. A climate of uncertainty and distortion has been created which will disappear, I remind the Senate, under the GST regime advocated by the coalition with the removal of a raft of taxes, including the notorious wholesale sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that, although there will be no exemption for these industries under the GST, the firms affected have no problems with this because they are well aware of the offsetting benefits in the Fightback package. These benefits will solve the dilemma which exists in the different areas of paper manufacturing with respect to sales tax, because there will be a climate of security and prosperity for all sections of the industry and its employees. Unlike the Government's vacillating actions, which will have a cascading, retrospective effect, the Fightback package is on the table and the industries have been able to calculate the gains for Australians ahead of time. I support the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As we have heard, this piece of legislation&mdash;the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill 1992&mdash;proposes to remove the sales tax exemption which currently exists for toilet and facial tissues, exercise books and some types of paper bags which are made from 100 per cent recycled paper. In removing that exemption, what it really means is that it will impose a 20 per cent tax on the wholesale value of these products.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This will wipe out the advantages which consumers have enjoyed by being able to purchase these goods at competitive prices. Indeed, I would argue that in some cases it will wipe out the market for some of these products, but I will return to that later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable senators will recall, we have recently passed a reform package of Bills which streamlined&mdash;in fact, totally rewrote&mdash;the sales tax system. This system will come into effect on 1 January. After that package was released in May, this separate Bill appeared, I would say, completely out of the blue&mdash;no warning, no consultation with the industries which would be affected and, I believe, no attempt by this Government to assess the effect of this Bill on those industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The contents of the Bill arise from the efforts of the Industry Commission&mdash;the good old economic, rationalist Industry Commission&mdash;to remove what it calls the distortion of preferential taxation for recycling. The Industry Commission recommended that the total concession for recycled paper products should be removed.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill removes some of the exemptions&mdash;that is, those which do not benefit the major paper manufacturers&mdash;but it keeps in place the concession in respect of certain writing papers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats support the other items remaining exempt. I simply make the point that this legislation is clearly favouring big manufacturers against smaller operators. I believe it has been tailor-made to fit the corporate objectives of some of the large firms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, let us look at the environmental arguments the Government has used to justify this decision. There are two categories of items. First, the termination of the exemption for exercise books is inexplicable. Writing papers made from 100 per cent recycled paper will continue to be exempt, but if the same paper has a piece of cardboard stapled to it and is bent to form an exercise book shape, it&mdash;the same paper&mdash;will be taxable. There is no consistent policy thread for that decision. I can only conclude that the Government is willing to deliberately advantage some producers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second group of affected products is the so-called single use items&mdash;facial and toilet tissues and paper bags. The rationale we have been given for opposing tax concessions for these single use products, I think, is completely spurious. The argument is that it is a waste of recycled paper to use it in an item that can be used only once. The Government says that writing papers can be recycled many times, so it is only these kinds of products that should obtain concessions. But the argument is flawed. I point to the evidence by Mr Dunne of the Paper Converting Company that, whilst papers can be recycled four or five times, they cannot be recycled into writing papers that many times. The multiple recycling that people speak of with praise is basically for cardboard. It is not possible to recycle writing papers into writing papers many times over. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it is a waste to use recycled paper, that is, paper which has previously been used at least once, on a single use item&mdash;and that is the justification the Industry Commission and the Government are giving us&mdash;then surely it must be a greater waste to use virgin fibre in a single use item. With recycled paper there has been at least one prior use. I think one could argue that, because of this particular Bill, there will be a switch to virgin fibre in these products. The Government says, `That's okay because we support sustainably managed plantation based virgin fibre production'. The Democrats also support sustainable paper production, but surely it is better to sustainably produce the paper, then use it once, then use it in a single use item, than simply to use it first in a non-recyclable, end of use product. The whole environmental argument mounted by the Government is plainly wrong&mdash;totally unconvincing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government said the problem is that the concession is being abused by some falsely labelled imports. During the hearings of the Select Committee on Sales Tax Legislation I asked a Tax Office official what the figures were for imports of recycled paper on which this assertion was based. I was told that the Government does not have any figures, that the figures are not actually disaggregated. What is the Government relying on? Is it relying on the claims of the major producers, those in competition with the small Australian owned producers in this case? If imports are the problem, why do we not look at the problem with imports? Why do we not introduce an accreditation scheme? It is possible to do that. It could be policed by Environmental Choice Australia. Why do we not do this to stop false advertising? We do not need to eliminate the concession. I do not believe the Government has explored this option seriously enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the political side, one of the real problems with this legislation is the way in which it was introduced out of the blue, late at night on 25 June. The concession was withdrawn from midnight that night and many small Australian firms found their whole market had been significantly altered. There is some case for making sales tax changes apply from the date of announcement in the Budget context, and I know that is the usual practice. One can justify it because the matter is well publicised, so the views of non-government members can be publicly known and the matter is then usually dealt with by the Parliament fairly promptly. But in this case it has been a totally different matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This announcement was made, the Bill was introduced, just before the long winter recess. It has been in the Parliament for almost four months. For four months these small operators have been operating in a climate of total uncertainty. They have had a market significantly altered by this proposal. To wait four months is very bad public policy. The Democrats opposed this legislation from the start because we believe sales tax should have the ability to discriminate and to bring about socially and environmentally just objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We successfully conducted some public hearings on this matter in the Senate Select Committee on Sales Tax. Mr John Pedlar from Austissue, Mr Dunne from the Paper Converting Company and Mr Felderbaum from Packmore Merchandising gave evidence of the effects of this proposal on their small businesses. Their main complaint was the timing of this proposal&mdash;quite rightly pointing out that they had made investment decisions committing themselves to millions of dollars, in some cases, following the Government's publicised intention to maximise the extent of recycling in Australia. The impact on their sales in the July and August months has been quite devastating&mdash;and all of this because of a Bill which was not even law at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition members on the Committee were, I think, quite persuaded by the evidence of these witnesses. I understood, and I am sure the Opposition members said, that they were going to oppose this Bill, and we were happy with that decision. We thought that the matter was over and so did the small business people. But then, of course, the lobbyists from the big companies went to work on the Opposition, not in the Senate but in the House of Representatives. And I am sorry to say that the Opposition crumbled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Reith went to see Mr Dawkins and then the Opposition made a deal&mdash;one of those things that, according to the Opposition, are done only between Democrats and the Government. Funny that, is it not? In this case the Opposition, I believe, sold out the interests of the Australian owned small businesses, and reversed its position completely. Although this did not get much publicity, it was certainly an education to the small businesses concerned. I know that they feel quite disillusioned about the Opposition's support for big business over small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats were in an isolated position in this. We had been confident that this legislation would be defeated.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The preceding speakers have quite clearly enunciated the business of the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill 1992. If passed, it will remove the sales tax exemption previously applicable to certain paper products made from 100 per cent recycled paper. The proposal is that the sales tax be applied retrospectively from 26 June. The motivation behind the Government's decision to introduce this Bill has already received discussion, and there seem to be two factors driving the action which have already been raised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, there appears to have been extensive lobbying, principally by foreign owned multinationals, regarding the removal of this sales tax from those people engaged in producing certain paper products. This is an inappropriate reason for the change to this tax. The firms that are likely to be putting pressure on both the Government and the Opposition are, naturally enough, those engaged in establishing a sustainable timber industry and timber products. While the Greens would certainly support such an approach to sustainable timber production and believe this is the way to go forward, we see it as utterly undesirable that it should come at the cost of penalising small Australian businesses that are also endeavouring to work in an environmentally friendly way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second factor that has been stated as underlying this decision is a well-founded concern that allegedly recycled products are being imported, mainly from Asia, in increasing numbers. There is doubt that the majority of these products conform to any reasonable definition of recycled paper and certainly do not comprise post-consumer waste paper. As Senator Kernot pointed out very clearly, the way to address that is to introduce quality controls and accreditation processes and to look very carefully at our import procedures. It is not, I say again, to penalise local Australian businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill can be seen only as an entirely retrograde step. Two and a half years ago the Government sponsored the development of recycled paper manufacturers by removing sales tax from their products and now is about to wind down one sector of the industry and thereby reduce the competition. This is a small niche market that does not really threaten the big players. It can be carried out locally, and it is very worthwhile for small businesses to be encouraged to go into this kind of venture, thereby broadening the manufacturing base of Australian industry in an environmentally sound direction. The Government is negating its undertaking to those companies that set themselves to fill the market niche. It is simply not good enough for the Government to walk away from these people and expect them to accept graciously offers of compensation. This switch away from supporting that part of the industry and throwing titbits to those who are severely penalised by this Bill does not look at the issue of future encouragement for similar businesses and local manufacturing projects bases on recycling.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As stated before, if the Government were serious about reducing the amount of allegedly recycled products that are being imported, it could use other methods of control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When demand for high quality recycled waste for recycling into writing paper outstrips the supply, then the Government's decision to narrow the sales tax exemption will make sense. We are far from that at the present time. As the managing director of Austissue, a Western Australian-based company, said in a briefing note to me:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . approximately 40% of the waste paper used to make tissue is not considered suitable for manufacture of printing and writing paper and to date the manufacturers of recycled printing and writing paper have been reluctant to take recycled paper for re manufacture.</PARA>
<PARA>There is thus a vast amount that can be taken up that offers a very useful manufacturing base. Since Austissue commenced operation in September 1989, it has produced only 100 per cent recycled product from post-consumer waste paper. This equates to a saving of approximately 200,000 trees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the Government's objective in exempting 100 per cent recycled products from sales tax was to stimulate a local industry. What has happened to that expressed objective? <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recent public actions, such as the Rio environment summit and the Be Smart recycling campaign, which has already been mentioned, are consistent with this theme. It is a double standard for the Government now to impose sales tax. It is a major contradictory signal being sent to businesses that are attempting to abide by the far-reaching aims and objectives of the environment summit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present it is not sensible to be shutting down a worthwhile sector of the industry, and I can only conclude that the Government is more interested in maintaining the domination of a few multinational companies. I applaud the moves made by Kimberly-Clark and others to shift to a fibre stock from plantation timber, and as a Green I would support any measures which add incentives to this. But penalising a small section of business is not the way to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The kind of rebalancing that seems to be holding weight with both the Government and Opposition is highly hypocritical. The availability of products which satisfy market demands while not relying on timber stock&mdash;rather, paper which would otherwise end up in landfill is used&mdash;must be seen as a positive step to making use of the oversupplied resource of once used paper. The process used is one that involves clean processes with little detrimental side effects. This is a shining example of the environmentally friendly and sound way in which employment can be created. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I feel very disappointed that this legislation, which severely penalises a section of Australian small business, is being supported by the Opposition. It puts the lie to the stance taken by members of the Opposition that they are supporting that sector. The Liberal Party in Western Australia indicated its support of this particular company, and the Opposition should be opposing this legislation. I can only express deep disappointment at the Opposition's support for the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am delighted that the Democrats are, appropriately, opposing this Government legislation. However, I am disappointed at the double standard shown by the Government in presenting this Bill, which I will be opposing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill 1992 seeks to remove the 20 per cent sales tax exemption on paper made from recycled fibre. I would remind the Senate that this approach to encourage recycling was initially made some years ago by the Democrats. When we first moved to remove that 20 per cent sales tax imposition on paper made from recycled fibre, we were opposed by both the Government and the Opposition. Only a short time afterwards the Government saw the political and electoral merit of supporting such a proposal, and it introduced legislation to differentiate between paper made from recycled fibre and paper made from virgin fibre.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As several speakers have already indicated, as a consequence of that differential several companies have established themselves in Australia. They have made very substantial investments, employ quite a considerable number of people and are making products made from recycled fibre. It is against that background that the Government has now chosen to introduce legislation to remove that differential with respect to certain products, and those products have already been enunciated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite apart from what the legislation seeks to do, the way in which the Government has chosen to introduce this legislation is also reprehensible. Changes to sales tax law, for very good reasons, become effective once they have been introduced into the Parliament and before they are debated. Given that process, it would only be fair that legislation of this sort to change sales tax should be introduced early in a session so that it can be dealt with expeditiously, any objections can be properly rehearsed and a decision can be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case the Government chose to introduce this legislation into the House of Representatives on essentially the last day of sitting. We did not see the legislation in the Senate. As a consequence, the removal of this 20 per cent sales tax exemption has been imposed on companies for quite some considerable period. During that time there has been no opportunity whatsoever to debate the issues and seek either a change in the law, an amelioration of the application of the law or the sorts of solutions that have now been put in place in relation to a bounty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Austissue in Western Australia, which employs some 40 people, has invested $7m&mdash;that is $7m of Australian investment&mdash;in making 100 per cent recycled tissue. There is also the paper converting company in Brisbane&mdash;again, making a large investment, employing people, and making a product everybody recognises as desirable. Those companies had that imposition placed upon them for a number of months before this legislation could be debated. Indeed, it is now October and we are now debating that legislation. I simply want to put on the record that if the Government is thinking in future of changing the sales tax laws in this way to severely embarrass and impact on companies that are operating in Australia, I ask it to do that early in a session so that the laws can be dealt with expeditiously and the matter sorted out once and for all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Watson made a considerable point about the increased percentage of recycling that has been going on in Australia. Some of that increased percentage is a direct consequence of the removal of that 20 per cent sales tax. That has been a significant inducement, particularly in the early days. I think everybody in this chamber will recall the considerable price differential, which discouraged even people of goodwill who wished to use recycled paper from using it because of the higher cost. The removal of the 20 per cent sales tax, which essentially brought recycled paper into line with paper made from virgin fibre, very significantly changed the pattern of use. As we all know, as increased amounts are used the unit costs come down, and that move, originally introduced by the Democrats, I believe has a lot to do with those increased percentages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, Senator Watson failed to mention that Australia, along with many other countries around the world, has very substantially increased its tonnage of paper used. Computers notoriously use enormous amounts of paper. So even though the percentage of fibre being recycled might be increasing, one needs to be aware of the absolute impact on forests, particularly native forests and old growth forests, an item Senator Chamarette referred to a few moments ago. That is where the point about ecologically sustainable development comes in. We simply cannot go on increasing indefinitely the impact in terms of tonnages. There is a point beyond which we cannot go, and that may equate with very high levels of recycling if the total tonnages become very large. One hopes that very shortly we will move in the other direction and will start reducing the tonnages as we get to the so-called paperless society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point that bears very much on this issue is the importing of tissue paper, particularly from Asia, and that paper being claimed to be 100 per cent recycled when, as Senator Watson said when raising it, there are serious doubts about that paper being made from recycled fibre. There is a perfectly adequate mechanism that could have been used to counter that because, clearly, that is a case of dumping. If a product comes in and is being sold on the Australian market at a price below the proper price or where it is not the product it claims to be, we do have, through the Customs legislation, mechanisms for going into other countries and investigating whether those products are as claimed and whether the prices being charged on the Australian market are fair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government chose not to invoke those mechanisms, so I believe that that is another black mark against it. It is prepared to do it in the commercial area, but it is evidently not prepared to do it for the protection of the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Watson was not quite correct when he talked about the difficulty of identifying whether fibre is recycled. My understanding is that it is simply impossible, for the reasons that Senator Watson mentioned, to satisfactorily make toilet tissue from totally recycled fibre unless there is sufficient fibre in the paper to give it the required strength, because the fibre tends to be short fibre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I also understand from Austissue in Western Australia, the toilet tissue which was being imported was of a weight&mdash;if I remember correctly, the figure is 9 grams per square metre&mdash;which would indicate that it simply could not have been 100 per cent recycled, because it would not have had the necessary burst strength. Austissue, with very modern technology&mdash;if I again recall the figure correctly&mdash;found it necessary to make toilet tissue of some 13 grams per square metre so that it would have the necessary strength. I certainly agree with Senator Chamarette in her claim that, in this respect also, there was very significant support for the larger multinational companies&mdash;Bowater Scott and Kimberly-Clark&mdash;whose profits substantially go overseas to the detriment of those smaller Australian companies that have really only recently entered the market as a direct consequence of the Government's legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amounts which were being put on the market by these companies were relatively small; we are really talking of less than 10,000 tonnes out of a total market of some 130,000 tonnes in the toilet tissue area. So neither of these companies, at least at this stage, could have seriously claimed that these Australian companies were a threat to their viability. Nonetheless, they sought through this Government a mechanism to seriously impede their development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Watson's next point related to an assessment of the total environmental impact of recycling. I can only agree entirely with what he said in this respect. In all aspects of industry, particularly in relation to recycling, we should be looking at the total environmental impacts. In detailing things like the transport costs involved in returning paper to factories, the de-inking process and the chemicals which are used, Senator Watson really told us only half the story. A comprehensive evaluation would look at the totality of paper making, paper use and paper recycling and would therefore have a very significant impact on the way in which paper is made in the first place, the sorts of products that are made and the sorts of inks that are used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the environmental imperative goes back into that initial manufacturing process under the incentive to reduce total impacts, one will see that the methods of manufacture in the first instance and the sorts of inks that are being used and so on will come under modification. I stress again that, in a comprehensive evaluation of total environmental impacts, we must bear in mind that there are limits on the total amount of paper that we can use, given the problems with the forests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to pick up on a couple of other points. A point made by Senator Kernot needs stressing. We strongly defend the use of the sales tax mechanism as a policy instrument. One of the clear advantages of the sales tax mechanism over the Fightback GST proposal is that, in one case, one can vary the wholesale sales tax to achieve certain desirable objectives, be they environmental or social. In the other case, one simply has a 15 per cent tax across the board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It simply does not wash, as Senator Watson tried to argue, that because there are other benefits associated with Fightback&mdash;we do not need to go into what those benefits are&mdash;there is no ability to differentiate between one product and another or one process and another so that we encourage one particular process and encourage industry to move in a particular direction. That is one of the fundamental defects of that across-the-board 15 per cent GST proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would argue very strongly that the wholesale sales tax regime, as complex as it is, is philosophically a far sounder way to go because it allows that differential. We believe that it should be used more widely. Honourable senators will recall, in relation to the reduction in sales tax on motor vehicles, that we argued very strongly that that reduction in sales tax again should be made dependent upon the fuel efficiency of the vehicles so that sales tax would become a very powerful instrument for moving our economy in desirable directions, whether that desirable direction is determined by environmental, social, economic or any other agreed objective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation before us removes this 20 per cent sales tax. We find it quite unsatisfactory. However, in view of the unwillingness of the Government to reverse its stance, as Senator Kernot has indicated, we negotiated with the Government. As a consequence, the Government has agreed&mdash;and the letter has already been tabled&mdash;that there remain in place a differential between paper made from recycled fibre and paper made from virgin fibre and that that differential be 20 per cent in the first year, 15 per cent in the second and 10 per cent in the third. In the meantime, there will be a review by the EPA in relation to the desirability of maintaining, in some more permanent way, some differential and, furthermore, that that bounty be paid to Australian companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While this process is less than satisfactory, nonetheless, in negotiating this agreement with the Government, we have achieved two desirable objectives. We have maintained that differential which will stay in place for at least three years during which there is a review and, at the same time, the bounty is targeted to Australian companies so that it overcomes the problem of the importation of paper claiming to be made from recycled fibre when there are very serious and legitimate doubts as to whether that is the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see this as second best but we are arguing that it is better than nothing and it is the best that could be negotiated under the circumstances with a government that was not prepared to use the other mechanisms which we believe could have been used under Customs legislation to stop dumping and to give a more permanent support to recycling. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not detain the Senate for very long. It is important for me to put on record my strong opposition to this extremely retrograde move by the Labor Government, a move which comes not so long after the progressive move that it made after pressure both from the Australian Democrats and from the environment movement to exempt in the first place recycled paper products from sales tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debate has outlined the pressures which have been brought to bear&mdash;those pressures which are coming from major multinational oligopolists in the paper industry and also the excuses which have been given for this move. The issue of products dumped from overseas is not even an excuse which can be used across the board as being a bad thing for Australian industry. I want to put on the record a letter from Castrol Australia which, I gather from the introductory section, was sent to other members of the Senate quite early in the discussion of this legislation on 27 August. It was also sent to me and it asked that this legislation be opposed. It made the point that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We introduced, albeit product imported from Sweden and Holland, "jumbo" toilet rolls and towels made from recycled paper, to the commercial and industrial markets in Australia. This initiative gave impetus to the development of the local industry, and now not only toilet rolls and hand wipes but industrial wipes made from recycled paper are providing significant benefits to all of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>The point is that, initially, this company used the advantage of the exemption to import</PARA>
<PARA>product but that led and gave impetus to the development of small business in this country, as has been outlined elsewhere in this debate. So even that excuse falls down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been pointed out, the Government had, and still has, other mechanisms available to it&mdash;mechanisms which it would have to use in the defence of these new Australian industries and environmentally sound small businesses which are providing products for an Australian community which wants to use them. It would have to use those mechanisms through trade and customs regulations and anti-dumping measures&mdash;and I would add labelling measures which are also necessary both for imported and Australian products&mdash;if indeed this legislation were to be defeated at this second reading stage, as I believe it should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The economic rationalism which we hear so often from the Industry Commission and which has been so rampant in this Parliament under this Government is with us again today in this iniquitous piece of legislation. If there is ever a level playing field&mdash;and that is probably the greatest myth of all&mdash;then it should be tilted in the interests of the survival of the planet. As Senator Coulter has said and as I have heard Senator McMullan, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, who is in charge here today, articulate very lucidly, one of the major advantages of the wholesale sales tax regime is the ability to tilt the playing field, whether it is level or not, in the interests of social, environmental or economic benefit to the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, the question of recycled paper products is one of those areas. I attended a meeting launching a recycled paper product at which Senator McMullan spoke, I think within a week of the release of the Fightback program. He made that point very strongly at that meeting and I wish he were making that point as strongly here today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This area of recycling, whether it is of paper or other products, is one of those areas where we must tilt the playing field. We are tilting it back in the wrong direction here and, what is worse, it is in the interests of oligopolists; it is not in the interests of Australian small business and it is not in the interests of Australian consumers because, in the end, the people who want to use recycled products are the ones who will be caught in the grip of the oligopolists who can then have a strong market influence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The initial measure to exempt recycled paper products across the board was one which we saw create a burgeoning industry; provide product for interested consumers; and generally have a positive benefit, except for those major companies.

I am opposed to this legislation and I do not think it should even be given a second reading. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Democrats will claim that they had a prior mortgage on that view; I shall not debate that issue. Suffice to say that the Labor Government was last to come on board. Somebody once said, `It is better to be in the last carriage than not be on the train at all'. Having now come on board, the sales tax has been off, then on and now some wishy-washy compromise which, quite frankly, falls between two stools. The decision in the first place by the Government to take off the 20 per cent tax was driven by circumstances of political expediency in a climate where the economy was not perceived to be in such a terrible, diabolical mess as it is now. The Government understood that for its own survival it had to garner up the Green vote and attract their second preferences, and so it continued to do these spiffy deals in an attempt to maintain its survival.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having done that and moved into a different environment, the Government has chosen now to change the rules. The sad thing about these decisions is that they totally disrupt business in Australia. When one talks about business, one is talking about the standard of living and jobs for ordinary workers&mdash;the people that the Government proclaims that it represents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Austissue has been referred to today and it is perhaps the most eloquent example that I can give. It is a company that understood and knew in its own mind the ground rules. It is a company that decided to set up a discrete business exclusively on the basis of the tax regime at the time to produce a product from recycled paper and enter into a very competitive environment. As a result of that decision, it  invested some $7m, $8m or $10m. It has a work force of some 40 people&mdash;a dedicated, efficient, effective and loyal group who are all good Western Australians. The company believed at the time that the ground rules would not be shifted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that when businesses make decisions about investment they make them on the basis of stability of government, probable stability of the economic environment and certainly of decisions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been observed by somebody else, sales tax is already paid on the product that the business is producing.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been a certain amount of rewriting of history going on in the most recent part of this debate on the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill 1992, and I would like to come back to comment on that before I conclude.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, I will go to the questions of general principle that are involved in the debate about this legislation which some other senators have referred to also.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are fundamentally two related questions that we need to answer. One is: should the tax system&mdash;and, in this case, the indirect tax system&mdash;be able to discriminate between products on the grounds of their environmental, social or other desirability? The second is: if the system has that capacity, should a government as a consequence be prepared to assess the merits of the matter and make a decision to exercise that right to discriminate?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My view is, clearly, that the answer is yes. That is why I oppose the goods and services tax which the Opposition is proposing to introduce, and the manner in which it is proposing to introduce it. That is why at least what Senator Watson said, with which I disagree, was consistent with the Opposition's policy, which is more than I can say for Senator Crichton-Browne. It is the case that the capacity to discriminate is an important distinction that the Australian people have before them in assessing the competing indirect tax systems that are being contemplated. It is a factor that they should take into account when they consider who they think should next govern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The environment is not the only element in which discrimination should be possible, but it is one. The goods and services tax claims as a virtue that it does not discriminate. It claims as a virtue that it will put the relative price of solar panels up compared with all other sources of household heating, and that it will do away with the exemption on other environmentally desirable products, including those aspects of recycled paper that will remain wholesale sales tax exempt after this amendment is passed. There will still be a substantial amount of recycled paper that will be wholesale sales tax exempt and on which the goods and services tax would apply which, on Senator Crichton-Browne's criteria, is called changing the rules after companies have made investments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not wish to debate that tangent. The substantial point is, yes, that right to discrimination should continue, and it does. That does not mean that every element that is put into a regime, on the basis of an assessment about what discrimination should exist, should be immutable.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The particular discriminations need continually to be assessed to look at their impact. It is a question of social, environment and economic cost benefit. It is not just, `We thought that this was the most appropriate route, therefore, we should inexorably continue down it, even if the evidence tends to point to the fact that it is not achieving its purpose.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wholesale sales tax is not, in very many circumstances, the most effective measure for these sorts of discriminations. It is appropriate on some occasions and it is used and its capacity to be used is desirable. It is similar to income tax: it is not, in the normal course, the best manner of providing assistance to industry or to other socially desirable objectives, but sometimes it is and it needs to be used. There is no particular argument about that. All sides of the Parliament, to a greater or lesser extent, support the use of tax concessions in the income tax area to, for example, encourage research and development. But we need to be selective, considered and specific about where and how we use that discrimination&mdash;which we should retain but which the Opposition proposes, should it be elected, to abolish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a question of social, environmental and economic cost-benefit. That therefore requires a very substantial targeting of the measures that are used. That is essentially what this amendment is about. It is about better directing the exemption to achieve the purposes for which the original exemption was put in place. The original broad exemption had no discernible effect on the recycling rates of Australian papers. There is nothing in the data that I have seen to indicate a major change in the rate of increase of utilisation, but it did divert waste paper from its previous uses into the manufacture of things such as tissues and toilet papers and it also led to a boom in imports of certain paper goods. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am going to talk in a moment about what could be done about it. I do not want to divert to that very much, because it is a very secondary question. However, it is relevant and I want to say something about it. The Government has mentioned it as an issue and several senators, in speaking in the debate, have mentioned it. So I will refer to it, but I do not think it is the core issue. It is a matter of concern because the imports had some potential economic impact in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point that has been made which has been accepted fairly broadly&mdash;I do not know about universally&mdash;in the debate is that, while recycling is essentially desirable and it is appropriate that we should be taking action as governments and as citizens to encourage recycling, not every recycling action is environmentally beneficial. It is a question of judgment to say, `Is the recycling that is involved here going to use more resources in the process of recycling than might otherwise be used in the production of this particular output with some other mechanism for so producing it?'. It is a question of judgment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We could recycle almost everything if we were prepared to use enough resources in the recycling process but, on a net basis, that may not be environmentally desirable. It is a flavour of the month issue, and that is desirable. It is very good that recycling is the flavour of the month issue, but it does not mean we should lower our rigorous standards of analysis about whether a particular initiative should be taken. That is why the Government is pursuing&mdash;which has been referred to by some senators&mdash;other recycling initiatives. There is a large number of them. I do not intend to recapitulate them because it diverts us from the debate. It is a matter on which I did quite a bit of speaking around Australia when I was on the back bench. It was an issue in which I had a particular concern and interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reiterate that after this legislation passes there will be significant remaining discrimination in the wholesale sales tax in favour of environmentally desirable products, including significant amounts of recycled paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me talk briefly about the imports argument. The evidence is that imports of exercise books and paper bags had more than doubled, while imports of tissues had trebled over the period 1989-90 to 1990-91, which corresponds very closely with the period the sales tax exemption was available for these products. Over that time imports of paper products overall fell significantly. It is clear that there was an upsurge in imports of these products. It is not possible, as I understand it, to disaggregate and say, `This was claimed to be recycled and this was not'. Looking at the categories, however, there is a remarkable compatibility between them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The primary purpose of the Government is not to introduce wholesale sales tax changes to encourage imports of papers so that those who are trying to set up recycling industries in Australia are subjected to substantial import competition. There was a problem with imports, although there is a lot of anecdotal debate about whether or not they were bona fide. I do not claim to have either the scientific knowledge to be able to assess it or the data to be able to reinforce it; that debate is being carried by others. But it is quite clear that there was a problem of substantial import competition, and we were creating a wholesale sales tax benefit the impact of which was to encourage recycling in other countries rather than here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was also some concern about the benefit that might have flowed to consumers from these reductions in wholesale sales tax. That is certainly what was intended because that is what changes the price signals and people's preparedness to buy different products. I do not want to put too much emphasis on this; I make the point for a reason which some honourable senators will understand: there is some concern&mdash;and it is one of the reasons why wholesale sales tax is not always the most effective mechanism&mdash;that there was no guarantee that the reduction in the tax was necessarily passed on to consumers. Some was, there is no doubt. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> That is a very heroic set of assumptions. They assume that every tax reduction will be passed on 100 per cent, except payroll tax which will be only 50 per cent passed on. The Opposition is trying to assume that it will have a jobs effect, but that nothing else will be absorbed by companies emerging from a recession. That is just another flaw which has been shown up by what has happened here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to be diverted too much into the industry bounty issue. I think that is one issue around this Parliament where we are in some agreement. So to me there does not seem to be a lot of virtue in speaking about it at great length. Whatever people think about how we should have proceeded, there is a general view that, if this measure proceeds, there should be some compensating payment made. So a lengthy speech about that would be one of those heated agreement exercises which only takes up the time of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, one part of the rewriting of history, as I am informed&mdash;this is not a matter of my direct personal information but it relates to information that has been made available to me&mdash;is that at least one of these companies, namely Austissue, set itself up to take advantage of the sales tax exemption announced by the Government. My understanding and advice is that Austissue was set up with a financial assistance grant of $200,000 from the Western Australian Government in 1988, and the sales tax exemption was announced in July of 1989. I do appreciate companies having foresight, but to make a decision 18 months before the Government had announced a policy on the basis that that policy would set up a desirable environment for the company to operate in is foresight above and beyond the call of duty; it is just not possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us not rewrite the history books and say that these people made a decision on the basis of announced government policy and therefore the change is grossly unfair. As I am advised, that is just not the case with regard to that particular example. That is not to say that taking away the exemption has no impact on that company. Obviously it does, and that is why there is some agreement about transitional measures&mdash;because Australians are employed there performing a socially desirable function in a way that we hope they can continue to do in an economically viable way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why there are some compensatory measures. So, for as long as the system is driven by wholesale sales tax, there will be some exemptions for recycled paper&mdash;which is more than the Opposition can say. But where we are trying to target them more successfully and there are consequences to particular industries, these sorts of measures are available to facilitate the continuance of that operation&mdash;not on the basis that we have changed the goalposts from where they were when the companies affected started because that, on the advice I have, is clearly not the case; but on the basis that, nevertheless, they are adversely affected and there ought properly to be an examination of the consequences of that. Austissue is not necessarily the only company involved but it is the one about which people have been speaking at length. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look forward to the passage of this legislation. I think it will more effectively target the proper discrimination in the wholesale sales tax system in favour of recycled paper; it will achieve the environmental purposes more effectively; and it will enable the Australian businesses that are proposing to set up major recycling operations, some of which are going ahead at this very time, to do so on a more successful economic basis. </PARA>

<PARA>I point out that, although I criticised the slow passage of this Bill, it has had one unintended beneficial side effect. I have had the chance to be informed of an anomaly, which I have attempted to rectify by way of this amendment. The amendment seeks to exempt the RSPCA, an Australian institution, from paying sales tax. Sales tax law has always recognised that public benevolent institutions, or PBIs, as they have come to be called, should be exempt. We know that those institutions provide valuable community service and we think it is proper that they are exempt from tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our recent select committee hearings on the rewriting of the sales tax law we discovered that the original legislation would have impacted on the operations of traditional public benevolent institutions, and there was a legitimate outcry. I accept that the Government did not intend to tax the charities and other public hospitals in the way that would have happened under this Bill, and it withdrew its proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time, I was not aware of the anomaly with respect to the RSPCA. It goes back to a decision in 1931 of the High Court which held that the term `public benevolent institution' is limited to those bodies which promote `the relief of poverty, suffering, distress or misfortune'. That test excludes the RSPCA because it does not include bodies that promote the relief of suffering and distress of animals, only humans. One could argue that that is a legal technicality and that at the time it involved a narrowing by the High Court of previous tax decisions concerning institutions that provide a public benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Queensland branch of the RSPCA recently decided to test this anomaly in the courts. Justice Shepherdson of the Supreme Court of Queensland, who heard the case, looked at the matter not in that narrow way but in the interests of the community in general and in the interests of justice. His Honour allowed the RSPCA's appeal. He held that the RSPCA was a public charity and that its object was to promote morality and to check man's innate tendency to cruelty. He said that the identity of the persons benefiting from the benevolence of the RSPCA was mankind generally. I agree with that; I think many of us would agree with it. Furthermore, he said that the legislature&mdash;that is, this Parliament&mdash;did not intend to penalise the RSPCA through sales tax because it specifically concerned animals. According to him, the RSPCA is a public benevolent institution and entitled to exemption from sales tax legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Taxation Office appealed against this decision and the Full Court upheld the appeal. The outcome is that the RSPCA still has to pay sales tax on what I believe is a technicality, despite the fact that it provides wonderful community service and has done since before Australia became a sovereign nation. The RSPCA has a branch in every State and Territory in Australia. Its work is well known and supported. As I said, it is an Australian institution. It operates as separate State-based institutions&mdash;formed in 1872 in Tasmania and 1892 in Western Australia. I have listed the various State organisations in my amendment to ensure that they are all covered. The Society has been assisting the community since long before Australia became a country and this Parliament came into existence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The combined budgets of the various State organisations of the RSPCA are approximately $10m. So the elimination of this tax burden by my amendment will provide an equivalent boost in resources of almost 10 per cent. Some State organisations are currently in debt, and having to pay this tax is worsening their situation. Because the RSPCA now has to pay sales tax, it cannot devote that portion of its money to its various programs. Its most well-known function is the animal shelters where stray pets are collected, nursed if necessary, and found a new home, if possible. I am told by the RSPCA that tight funding has meant that it has had to put down a lot more animals than would otherwise have been necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Society has been expanding its activities into the aged care arena. Everybody knows of the great love and companionship that aged people receive from their pets. Often that pet is the only `person' aged people talk to&mdash;and I call the pet a person because it becomes a person in people's lives. A lot of research is being done showing that pets can improve the emotional and physical health of aged people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the RSPCA conducts education programs which involve visits to schools and other places to promote awareness in the community. The programs are very popular and the RSPCA is called upon to exercise this function frequently. However, the Victorian branch of the RSPCA had to close its education office recently because of funding pressures&mdash;pressures that are exacerbated by the imposition of sales tax. Paying sales tax reduces the resources available to employ more inspectors and to assist distressed animals. The combination of the rural recession and drought in some areas has led to severe deterioration in the health and treatment of some stock, especially sheep. Many honourable senators will have seen distressing footage of this on television. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One final area I would like to cover relates to the Society's work on behalf of native Australian wildlife. Each State has plans to establish wildlife sanctuaries to care for sick and injured native animals. Many thousands of these animals are hurt and maimed on our roads each year. I find it hard to understand or anticipate what sort of justification the Government and the Opposition will put forward to oppose the kinds of measures that I am proposing to be assisted by the removal of the sales tax. I think the Australian people will be very interested to hear this justification as well. Surely governments should be doing everything in their power to assist community organisations which achieve desirable goals, as the RSPCA clearly does. Removing the tax burden from the RSPCA will not cost money. It does not have to cost money. If we extend the benefit of what it does at the community level, I think we can still argue that it would save money in the long term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the Commonwealth is not the sole carrier of blame because most taxes are paid to State and local governments&mdash;namely, payroll tax and land tax. I am glad that Treasurer Dawkins has said that he will take the matter up with various State Treasurers on behalf of the Society, but that is not good enough. It is not good enough to see the merit of the case being argued at the State level and yet, when we have the opportunity to do something at the Federal level, oppose removing the annual sales tax bill of approximately $800,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that Senator Brownhill is a patron of the RSPCA. On 7 October in this place he drew our attention, via a notice of motion, to the plight of the RSPCA with respect to having to pay that amount of sales tax. I am hoping that Senator Brownhill will vote for my amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that Mr Reith's office has been approached on this issue in the last couple of days by senior members of the RSPCA. I understand that the leadership of the Party has considered the issue and has decided to oppose this change. I think that is really regrettable. As I have said, it is very difficult to justify when in this place recently the Opposition voted for changes in classifications to assist the small Australian owned manufacturing company Voxson Sales Pty Ltd in Brisbane. I would like to understand its selectivity in these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition proposes to zero rate the RSPCA for GST purposes. I guess it thinks it can make a political point in showing how GST is fairer than wholesale sales tax. We have heard it all 100 times already. It concedes the point that it is wrong not to exempt the RSPCA&mdash;because it is going to zero rate it&mdash;but it says, `Heavens no, we can't take the opportunity to do it now because, first, the Democrats are proposing this amendment and, secondly, we never improve legislation; we wait until we get into government and then we will start again'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The RSPCA touches so many Australians. They will not understand that fine philosophical distinction about how we should approach legislation. The coalition has no qualms about taxing food, weddings and funerals, but will it assist to free a great Australian institution from an anomalous tax burden? Unfortunately the answer is no but, as Senator Watson usually appeals to me during the course of debate, in the same courtesy I will appeal to him to judge the merit of this argument. Given that it is going to zero rate the RSPCA under a GST, what possible justification can the Opposition put forward for opposing my amendment which would achieve exactly the same outcome here and now?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The genesis of the amendment proposed by the Australian Democrats was the unsuccessful court action whereby it was sought to change the law in terms of seeking the status, under the sales tax provisions, of a public benevolent institution. That is the issue. I think it is appropriate that the Liberal-National Party coalition should place on record its public appreciation of the important community service work carried out by the RSPCA. In fact, under the coalition's Fightback proposals as enunciated in relation to the GST regime, the RSPCA would not carry a tax burden because it is deemed to be a non-profit organisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But whether it is a non-profit organisation is not the issue before us today. The issue before us today is not about profit, but about a public benevolent institution, which is quite different. Senator Kernot mentioned an aspect of courtesy and I would like to put on the record the blatant display of lack of courtesy on this occasion. Literally within minutes of the scheduled end of this debate, we were given a page of amendments in this chamber. This is not the usual way in which the Democrats deal with me in relation to tax matters. It amounts to the hijacking of a proposal&mdash;in other words, a blatant attempt to put the Democrats on a higher rung of the social welfare-type ladder, albeit temporarily. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we win the next election this issue will not be a problem under the GST proposals. But the real issue is that the Senate did not provide the courtesy of giving adequate notice to all members of this chamber. As I have said, this is most unusual. The major parties in this chamber assess the merits of the matter and also examine the precedents which would flow from an amendment such as the Australian Democrats have introduced at the present time. This amendment would not go without notice by other similar bodies which are not currently recognised as benevolent institutions under this or any other Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, the amendment was introduced without warning and distributed only minutes before the scheduled list of speakers was to conclude. So, prima facie, this has all of the hallmarks of a minority party's opportunistic approach to hijacking issues. It uses a technique which is known as `tacking'&mdash;adding completely unrelated issues to Bills which pass through the Senate to try to distract attention from one issue to another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind you, Mr Chairman, that the major parties require a careful evaluation of amendments&mdash;involving the shadow ministry, back bench consultation and evaluation, and party room discussion&mdash;so that everybody within the parties has an opportunity to assess the merits and consequences of legislation. The Democrats, through the technique they have applied today, have denied both of the major parties that opportunity of evaluation and care. If we go down this track we are bound to get bad legislation, no matter how sincere and needy a cause may be. The framing words always need care, particularly in the case of tax legislation which is a very precise science. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The short notice is not only discourteous but also a cheap political point-scoring technique using a very respected organisation in society. It demeans the role and practices of the Senate&mdash;and that is unusual for the Democrats&mdash;and I hope it will not be seen as a precedent for further attacks in the Senate and misuse of the Senate procedures in the manner in which they have misused them today. Evaluation and cooperation are essential ingredients for the successful passage of such an amendment. The Democrats have to apply a more cooperative, reasoned and practical approach if they wish to have success with their amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kernot drew attention to other amendments which the Opposition has agreed to. I put to Senator Kernot that consultation and evaluation were present on that occasion; they are missing on this. I hope Senator Kernot will set her house in order for future occasions. Because of the manner in which the amendment has been introduced, the lack of evaluation of the court's decision and other issues, I regret to say that on this occasion we will not be agreeing to the amendment. </PARA>

The opportunity is here and now to remove a $800,000 tax burden from the RSPCA and to free those resources for the wonderful community work which it does to the great benefit of the whole of Australian society.

This is picking an isolated organisation&mdash;not by category, like public benevolent institutions for which the court has developed over a long period of time a set of criteria, and everybody who meets those criteria get the same benefit&mdash;and saying, `We like this one'. Why?  Because it has come to attention because it challenged the prevailing ruling in the  court. </PARA>

They have not gone to court; they have not been in the newspapers; they have not been to see democrats so they do not qualify. </PARA>

We have here an attempt just to pick the immediately controversial, the currently attractive, without any framework. What about all the other organisations that provide animal welfare assistance in Australia? What about them? What about a lot of organisations that provide other worthwhile social assistance? I get hundreds of letters, and Senator Watson must get hundreds of letters, from people seeking wholesale sales tax exemption, but they do not fit the category of public benevolent institutions.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to consider each of these within the broader context of the framework of tax legislation. </PARA>

There are a lot of bodies which do very worthwhile work which are not public benevolent institutions and which pay wholesale sales tax. If we are to say that they are not to do so, then we have to say where we are going to get the revenue from.

If one mentions the RSPCA, people will say, `What about the cat haven and all the other people who do the same sort of work around the community'&mdash;very worth while work&mdash;`and get a lot of assistance from government and individual citizens?'. The RSPCA, for example, gets a lot of assistance through the wholesale sales tax system. But let us be clear about something else because people who listen to or read this debate may misunderstand and think there has been some recent change to the wholesale sales tax situation with regard to the RSPCA. That is just not the case. The RSPCA has been operating under the wholesale sales tax legislation since it was introduced in the 1930s and the circumstances it faces now are the same as the circumstances it has always faced. This is not an attempt to relieve the RSPCA of some new burden. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is nobody in Australia who would argue that the RSPCA is not a worthwhile body.

Senator McMullan has asked why I have chosen the RSPCA. I have chosen it because it is inherently worthy in itself. There is nothing similar to the RSPCA in Australia. There is nothing of its size and nothing of its national scope. In any case, I would ask Senator McMullan to consider the view that laws should keep pace with community values. I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to tell me how he could explain to Australians in 1992 that we should make a distinction between the alleviation of human suffering and the alleviation of animal suffering.

I can be just as selective as Senator McMullan about what taxpayers might be happy or unhappy about the Government spending their money on. If I am given a choice between the RSPCA and non-productive speculative takeovers, then I will take the RSPCA any day. This amendment deserves the Government's support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I refer to the appalling social wreckage of the Government's economic policies, which have left more than 1 1/2 million people in the situation where they are out of work, have given up looking for work or are seriously under-employed; as well as 700,000 children living in families without a breadwinner and some 200,000 young unemployed. In these circumstances, does the Minister have the gall to endorse the Prime Minister's arrogant assertions that the recession was over a long time ago and that this Government saved Australia? Given the doubts that the Minister expressed last Sunday about Australia achieving even a miserable 3 per cent growth rate, will he now give an assurance that, if necessary, the Government will hand down a further economic statement?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not accepting many of the assumptions and figures with which Senator Alston prefaced his question. When he comes to the issue of the Prime Minister's remarks about the recession, I make this point: the Prime Minister said that the recession was over in terms of the technical definition of a recession. That is correct. The recession in Australia is over, as distinct from the recession in the United Kingdom, for example. The UK has had nine quarters of negative growth and we have now had several quarters of positive growth. The economy is growing at 2 1/2 per cent a year, on the best extrapolation of the existing figures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a difference between saying that in relation to the technical definition of a recession and saying that the consequences of the recession are over. Everybody who knows anything about it knows that, in terms of a recovery in an economy such as this, employment is the last indicator and the last area in which recovery is demonstrated. That has always been so, and it is so in terms of this recession as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because we recognised that the consequences of the recession were not over, we put in the Budget some very large expenditure on job creation programs, particularly in the hands of local and regional government. We recognised that the consequences of the recession in terms of employment were still very much present in Australia. Those opposite opposed that fiscal stimulus. Their Leader opposed it. Their Leader said we should not have that fiscal stimulus. When interest rates were being reduced, their Leader said that interest rates should not be reduced. In each of those cases&mdash;</PARA>

I am grateful to the Minister for acknowledging that his Government did indeed cause the recession and is prepared to wear the blame for it. But I again refer to his statements of last Sunday, both early morning and late morning, the end result of which seems to be that he now expects the 3 per cent growth target to be met, but he also currently has doubts, given the figure for the last quarter.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since I spoke in the Senate last night, the UN Security Council has adopted Resolution 783 on Cambodia, which is the product of a substantial series of talks which have taken place in New York over the last couple of weeks in which Australia has been very closely involved, first through myself a couple of weeks ago and subsequently with officials.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That UN resolution does a number of things. It confirms the existing timetable for the implementation of the peace settlement, including that elections be held no later than May 1993. It deplores the Khmer Rouge's non-compliance, and demands that they fulfil their obligations under the Paris agreements. It invites the governments of Japan and Thailand to continue the efforts in which they have been engaged for the last few weeks to find a formula for the question of the Khmer Rouge's non-compliance and to report back to the UN Secretary-General and the co-chairmen of the Paris conference by the end of this month on the success or otherwise of those efforts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The resolution goes on to invite the UN Secretary-General to ask the Paris co-chairmen, that is to say, Indonesia and France, to then undertake consultations pursuant to, in effect, article 29 of the Paris settlement, and that is an important new step. It requests the Secretary-General to report back to the Security Council by 15 November, if the present difficulties have not been overcome by then, with the Security Council then to consider what further steps are necessary to ensure the realisation of the fundamental objectives of the Paris agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The resolution does, I think, demonstrate the continuing very firm resolve of the international community to implement the settlement. It offers the Khmer Rouge in effect the full benefits of the settlement if they are ready to comply with it. But it denies them the power of veto by confirming that the implementation of the settlement should continue according to the agreed timetable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The exercise under way by Japan and Thailand is one designed to secure the return of the Khmer Rouge to the peace process on the basis of the creation of a so-called administrative consultative body which would coordinate requests made by the various Cambodian factions on administrative matters relating to the Paris agreements. Whether or not that exercise is successful remains to be seen. But, if it is unsuccessful, it is likely that the Paris conference co-chairmen will convene a ministerial meeting, which I expect to be attending, in early November as part of that continuing consultative process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A likely next step to emerge then, if it is still the case that the Khmer Rouge are not cooperating, would be, I guess, a formal decision to proceed with the election, with it being understood that it would remain open to the Khmer Rouge to rejoin the settlement at least within certain time constraints if they did finally decide to comply fully with the terms of the settlement. But it would be clearly understood that the Khmer Rouge, by their continued non-compliance, would be consciously excluding themselves from the settlement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do want to emphasise that, notwithstanding the continuing comments one is hearing from the egregious Mr Pilger and others of that ilk that the Paris settlement does in fact involve the vesting of some kind of veto power in the Khmer Rouge, it is not the mood in any way of the international community at the moment to allow the Khmer Rouge to exercise such a veto power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all continue to take the view that the comprehensive settlement, as negotiated and signed last November, remains far and away the best means of achieving a genuinely durable, lasting peace in Cambodia, with other solutions involving the quarantining or exclusion of them from that process being less satisfactory. Nonetheless, there is a belief that, in the prevailing situation and given the very substantial achievements of the UN forces so far, which I spelt out in more detail last night in the Senate, there is ground for optimism for believing that one way or another some kind of effective, durable peace can be secured and most, if not all, of the UN peace plan can be implemented.</PARA>

The day before yesterday, from my recollection, the honourable senator's question related to correspondence I had received in the last six or seven weeks. I am sorry to disappoint Senator Campbell, but I have received letters as recently as 6 October which have gone to my Department; they were of the kind which we normally receive. That letter of 6 October was not from a manufacturer, as I told the honourable senator privately yesterday; it was from an importer. Prior to that, I had not, I think, received any letters supporting a change to the present tariff in the last six or seven weeks. Certainly, some have come in over the years. As I said to the honourable senator in my answer the other day, at the time the One Nation statement was put together we received representations about this from people in the automotive industry.

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1786" SPEAKER="Button Sen The Hon J.N." NAMEID="4F4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, TECHNOLOGY AND COMMERCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Maguire for this question. It is very thoughtful. I am aware of concern about the possible imposition of new taxes on the tourist industry. Since the mid-1980s Australian tourism has gone ahead very successfully and in 1991 2.4 million people visited Australia, an increase of 156 per cent on the figures of eight years earlier.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government has worked closely with the tourist industry, as it does with all industries. It is not content to rely on economic models worked out by academics. It works with industries on these matters and it has worked with the tourist industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The strategy the Government has developed recognises the growth potential of the tourist industry and its high employment potential. I have to say, though, that some parts of the tourist industry are very concerned about, in what is a blue sky, the dark cloud of additional taxes being imposed on this industry if, for example, an alternative government were elected. For example, Mr John Dart, the President of the Australian Federation of Travel Agents, after examining a proposal for a consumption tax, a GST, said recently:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But with Fightback, there are no offsets. There are no offsets in terms of the Fightback package because there is no payroll tax offset, and in many cases there is nothing else. So in essence the price of their product is going up.</PARA>
<PARA>Many tourist operators would be hit hard, of course, by a 15 per cent GST, as would thousands of other small business people. The fact is that there are 700,000 businesses in Australia and only 100,000 of them pay payroll tax. Small tourist operators are not in that group that pays payroll tax.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Short is interjecting. He understands the point very well because in the 1970s, when he was the member for Ballarat for a brief period, he argued very much against the abolition of a payroll tax because he understood the point in respect of small businesses. He did that very regularly, as did the Premier of Tasmania recently. In relation to the payroll tax issue he said that the abolition of payroll tax would not necessarily create jobs. His energy Minister, Mr Robin Gray, said that he believes the Hewson Fightback pledge to abolish payroll tax will not create employment in Tasmania. Senator Short, when he was the member for Ballarat, really understood the small business point. He said, `This is discriminatory against businesses in Ballarat which do not pay payroll tax'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. Does the Minister accept that Arnotts Ltd is a profitable company with strong export prospects and that the proposed takeover by Campbell's Soup Company could therefore have a negative impact on the Australian economy as profits go off-shore? Secondly, will the Government introduce pro-Australian foreign investment controls to prevent takeovers which would result in a net loss to the national economy and, if not, why not?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question of the proposed takeover of Arnotts by Campbell's is one which has to be dealt with by the Foreign Investment Review Board. It will look at it in terms of net benefits to the Australian economy and so on. Arnotts has been a successful company, but one which predominantly has satisfied the domestic market in Australia. If Arnotts is to become a truly international company&mdash;that is to say, one exporting to the Asia-Pacific region, which it has the capacity to do&mdash;one of the things which would greatly help it in that process is international marketing strength, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. It is possible&mdash;I do not know, but it is possible&mdash;that that could well be supplied by a company such as Campbell's, if the takeover bid were successful.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not proper for me to comment on the merits of a takeover bid. I think that is a matter for the shareholders of Arnotts and, in so far as it involves government administration and policy, it is a matter for the Foreign Investment Review Board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that a large proportion of Australian industry in significant sectors is foreign owned. Ten years ago the issue of foreign ownership simply meant that many Australian companies that were subsidiaries of foreign companies operated with a branch office mentality in Australia. There are one or two that still do. The majority of Australian companies that are foreign owned are not operating with a branch office mentality any more and are significant contributors to exports from Australia. IBM is a classic example, exporting last year $360m worth of computers and associated equipment from Australia. A few years ago it had certainly not done that. There are many other companies in that category.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In relation to the second part of the question, it is a matter that is registrable in respect of FIRB; it has to consider it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to whether Arnotts is a buoyant company, I have already answered that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Will the Minister for Justice advise the Senate of the level of cooperation between the Australian Federal Police and other law enforcement agencies, especially Customs, in relation to drug trafficking into Australia? What success are these agencies having, and has there been any recent change in the trend of the illicit drug trade into Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1790" SPEAKER="Tate Sen The Hon M.C." NAMEID="NJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="TAS" MINISTERIAL="JUSTICE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In fact, there is a success story to be told about the cooperation of the Federal Police and the Customs Service in trying to stem the flow of drugs being trafficked into Australia. Since January of this year, 29 kilograms of heroin have been seized, worth $35m on the streets of Australia; 200 kilograms of cocaine have been seized, worth some $160m; and 7 tonnes of cannabis resin have been seized, worth some $105m. One can see there that some $300m worth of drugs have been seized through the cooperative efforts of these agencies, depending very largely on intelligence gathering abroad by Customs contacts and by the Federal Police liaison officers in embassies such as Manila and Bangkok&mdash;in fact, in, I think, 12 embassies throughout the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This effort should be applauded. I believe it demonstrates the very high competence and integrity of those organisations. What it has done, of course, is stop the cash flow and criminal profits accruing to those criminal organisations&mdash;whether within Australia in the distribution of these drugs or in the remitting of funds to the overseas suppliers, who in Central America, for example, use the funds to pay their private armies and get their arms in order to fight against the governments of the countries they inhabit. So we have prevented $300m being made available to those organisations&mdash;criminal syndicates, and drug traffickers and collaborators within Australia&mdash;which would have been either laundered into legitimate business enterprises or perhaps used to foster more criminal activity. So the exercise has been extremely successful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Foreman asked whether any new trend was apparent. Quite clearly, the seizure of 200 kilograms of cocaine worth $160m is extremely worrying. It seems to indicate that what I prophesied some years ago&mdash;namely, that the drug barons and the warlords of Central America, having saturated the North American and European markets, would target Australia&mdash;is the case or, and perhaps additionally, that Australia is being used as a transit country from Central and South America across to Australia and then up into south-east and north Asia and perhaps even into Europe. If a cargo or passenger movement out of Australia is looked at by Customs in one of those countries, it thinks its origin is Australia and perhaps does not think in terms of cocaine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe we are at a new stage. We have to make it very clear, as I believe these seizures do, to those involved in the trade in cocaine that they will not succeed in their attempts to flood the Australian market, and I believe that message must be getting through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must be said that 70 per cent of Australian police seizures of drugs now come from intelligence gathered abroad through our embassy network and through cooperation with overseas law enforcement agencies. That shows the great wisdom of this particular network being established. I believe honourable senators would wish to acknowledge how good that has been. The cooperation of the Customs Service particularly has led to very remarkable inroads into drug trafficking into Australia. It means that we can say that, whilst we may not have won entirely, as I said to Senator Reid yesterday, the law enforcement agencies are working well in their attempts to stop supply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other part of the story in Australia must be to convince young Australians, through education and other programs such as the drug offensive program and through using sports heroes as drug offensive ambassadors, not to indulge in drug abuse. That is the other part of the strategy of the Australian Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy. Health and police Ministers are all agreed in a way which is unique in the world and which gives us great strength in the fight against drug abuse.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for Senator Boswell's allegation that this is a multi-million dollar business, this has been an effort by Senator Baume, amongst others, to make the point that the Prime Minister was a 50 per cent shareholder in a company called Euphron valued at $8.6m at 30 June 1991. The fact of the matter is that as at 30 June 1991 the company was owned by a number of shareholders, not just two as it now is. Under standing accounting practice, shareholders' equity, including the funds of all shareholders, was taken into account and a note in relation to subordinated capital was put into the accounts. Senator Baume understands these facts, but has chosen to ignore them.</PARA>

I also draw his attention to a media release from the responsible Minister, Mr Baldwin, dated 31 July, with the headline `Government pays under 21 year olds backdated training assistance allowance'. Given that it is well over four months since the Minister's assurance, and two and a half months since Minister Baldwin's media release, why is it that there are still 300 or more applications from young unemployed South Australians waiting to be processed in Adelaide because of a lack of cooperation from the Department of Employment, Education and Training?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Resources.

Why were these new higher inspection charges introduced at a time when the economy is still suffering from the devastating effects of the recession we had to have and when all encouragement should be given to the increase in exports? What is the justification for the daily inspection rate of $745 and the hourly rate of $172 when, for total cost recovery, applying a staff-expenditure multiplier of 1.92 gives an hourly rate of only $55.88? Can the Minister confirm that the $55.88 hourly rate would roughly equate to the New Zealand charge for these services?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is my understanding that AQIS is moving to a situation of full cost recovery in terms of the provision of its services and that this has been a phased move towards full cost recovery. The basis of establishing the principle of full cost recovery is that those who use the services of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service should pay for them and that all other taxpayers who do not use that service should not have to pay for them. In other words, there should be no cross-subsidisation and the users of the service should meet the cost of delivering the service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other principle here is that one of the reasons many Australian companies succeed in penetrating foreign markets with Australian exports of quarantinable materials is the very high standard that Australian products enjoy because of the work of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. If we had a lesser quality service our reputation abroad would be less impressive. We have a high quality service; our reputation abroad is good, and that is a very important selling point in marketing Australian products and produce abroad.</PARA>

Instead of pouring cold water on the coalition's proposals, the Treasury document, on the contrary, severely embarrasses the Government, and that is why it has been kept under wraps.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) this day, in response to a question asked by Senator Bishop on 12 October 1992, relating to certain allegations of tax avoidance.</PARA>
<PARA>On many occasions senators have risen and, under the provisions of chapter 11 of the Standing Orders and standing order 193, have taken objection to a question or an answer. Mr President, you have said, in my view quite properly, that if you were to apply that chapter and that standing order, very few questions would be admissible and many answers would similarly not be admissible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That chapter and that rule were put into the Standing Orders, I think very sensibly, by our predecessors in this place. When one looks at these orders one realises just how sensible our predecessors were. These standing orders have the purpose of ensuring that questions are asked in an orderly manner and that some sense of fairness is brought into debates&mdash;fairness not only to senators but also to others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I submit to you, Mr President, that there is a high risk that the question that was asked of Senator Button greatly ridiculed and brought into contempt the Taxation Office and members of the parliamentary Labor Party in New South Wales. It is not the first time that that sort of question has been asked; it is not the first time that an answer has been elicited and matters have been addressed. Senator Watson is in the chamber. He is a man of, I think, high repute who exemplifies to a great degree the sorts of people we have in this chamber. But at times matters are put forward that I think bring us all into disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The High Court has recently brought down a judgment in the political advertisements case. There has been much discussion about that decision. In the course of that discussion the point was made that Parliament does not conduct itself as it should, that it does not protect the liberties of people as it should, and that it does not do what it ought to do. I think there is much merit in those propositions. The only way we are going to rid ourselves of that reputation and the only way we are going to get around to acting as we ought is, given the general thrust that goes on in debate, to be fair and reasonable in the sorts of questions we ask and to be fair and reasonable in how we go about denigrating other people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question asked by Senator Bishop is, unfortunately, an example of what I am talking about. The question was handled with great drama. It was brought across in an envelope. I must say that I thought there was great concern to be felt about what was in that envelope; that there was great concern to be entertained in terms of the parliamentary Labor Party in New South Wales; and that there was great concern to be entertained in terms of members of the Tax Office. It appears from the answer that Senator Button gave today that there is just no merit in that proposition.</PARA>

I was intending to move to take note of the same answer because I found it utterly unacceptable, as indeed I found the letter from the Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, yesterday, which I tabled and of which presumably Senator Button has a copy but which he failed to table.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am interested today that Senator Button chose to quote from the gratuitous information the Commissioner of Taxation set out in a submission to the Public Accounts Committee dealing with a particular class of taxpayers whom he has chosen to investigate. He gratuitously did that. Mr President, I put to you that the Commissioner of Taxation has created an enormous precedent for himself and one we will be pursuing with regard to other categories. Whereas he admitted to investigating a large number of parliamentarians, what Senator Button failed to point out was that only three of those parliamentarians have been prosecuted, and&mdash;surprise, surprise!&mdash;they are all Liberal Party people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next surprise is this: I have placed on the record from time to time&mdash;and I have been assiduous in saying it&mdash;my concern about matters that are on the public record. The only things we have on the public record are the preferential treatment the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) received when he failed to lodge not one but two tax returns, and when he got a nice letter saying, `Please, would you mind awfully dropping it in'. There was no threat of legal proceedings; no threats at all, just a nice pleasant letter. Mr Keating is the man who was the Commissioner's boss. There were 10,781 Australians prosecuted last year for not lodging a tax return, but not the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I compare that with what happened to Mr Phillip Smiles, done for political purposes. The transcripts of the judgment are now on the record and can be dealt with without breaching the sub judice rule. We will go through that judgment later line by line. Mr Smiles was hounded, and he was prosecuted under the Crimes Act instead of under the Taxation Administration Act, which, on the Australian Taxation Office's own admission, is the normal way it is done. It is the first time it has ever done that, the reason being that Mr Smiles will lose his seat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I compared the two cases and asked a question, in full knowledge of the fact that the Commissioner is investigating this Labor Party politician. I have a copy of the record of interview of three witnesses&mdash;not one, not two, but three&mdash;which has been in existence for six months. Furthermore, three months ago it was put on the public record. Further, I want to compare the time that was taken in the investigation and prosecution of Mr Smiles and the time taken in dealing with this case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern is that we have fair and even-handed actions. We have seen evidence of politicisation of the Public Service. We saw it again today with the use of this Treasury report, which the Government tried to heavy the Treasury into preparing. It then tried to hide it, until the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> got it out under an FOI. Senator Short brought that to the attention of the Senate today.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join with Senator Macdonald in supporting Senator Cooney's remarks because I have a very serious concern also about the way this Parliament is being misused. I also share Senator Faulkner's concern about the pattern of consistent misuse to cast slurs upon the reputations of individuals and to smear individuals. There is a consistent and persistent pattern. It occurs not only in here but in committees, and it is of notoriety in Estimates committees. However, I want to refer particularly to the matter that was responded to on this occasion by Senator Button, the question and the answer which it elicited. The matter cast a very broad slur on an enormous number of people who work in the Australian Taxation Office&mdash;good citizens who work very hard in the interests of Australia&mdash;and the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, because that is where the decisions are made about whether prosecutions will proceed, not by the Commissioner of Taxation.</PARA></TALK.START>

The decision to prosecute those people was made by the Director of Public Prosecutions, who has already pointed out in a letter to Senator Bishop&mdash;which she apparently has not made apparent to her colleagues, who still think she is getting the facts right about the Smiles case&mdash;that the Crimes Act charge was laid in the Smiles case because no equivalent offence exists under the Taxation Administration Act. Senator Bishop has said that this is the first time someone has been charged with an apportionment matter under the Crimes Act. </PARA>

They are not the equivalent of making a late return, about which many people have had letters, and Senator Bishop knows&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While it is true that there are other shareholders, let me read from these other documents what these other shareholders were that were misrepresented in this place as somehow having some significant interest in the $8.4m of shareholders' funds that Mr Keating half owns. On 10 August 1991 Euphron Pty Ltd gave notice that 200 redeemable preference shares of the nominal value of $200 were redeemed out of `* profits/*the proceeds of a fresh issue of shares',  neither of which has been crossed out&mdash;another example of the most incredibly sloppy accounting I have ever seen in my life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shares redeemed were simply 100 fully paid `J' class redeemable preference shares in the name of John Joseph Brown and 100 in the name of Vincent Francis Hatton. The fact is that within six weeks a $430,000 investment became, by 30 June, represented by shareholders' funds of $4.2m for the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) minus the $200 redeemable preferences that were redeemed. Because of the continual interruptions from Senator Tate, I give him notice that I intend to raise on the adjournment debate tonight other matters about false returns, inaccurate returns and hopelessly incompetent returns&mdash;and perhaps misleading and mischievous returns&mdash;from this group. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support Senator Baume's motion to take note of Senator Button's answer. I refer particularly to the rather vicious attack that Senator Button chose to make on Senator Boswell. Senator Button attempted to say that Senator Boswell had deliberately tabled, on a previous occasion, only part of a document, thereby implying that, had the rest of it been tabled, we would have been told something else. In fact, Senator Boswell tabled the remainder of the document which he had partially tabled before. Indeed, despite the fact that it was made available to Senator Button, he was in no way able to say that it made the position any different. He continued to try to denigrate Senator Boswell by saying that it had only been a deliberately partial tabling.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The position got to the ludicrous stage when Senator Button read what was obviously a response that had been dictated to him by someone else and he clearly did not understand what he was reading. When Senator Hill very properly asked Senator Button to table the document from which he was reading, because it purported to tell us about additional shareholders and to change the input of what Senator Baume had been saying, surprise, surprise, he refused. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Button stood up and accused somebody else of partially tabling. Indeed, people on the other side have chosen to do this this afternoon. I will deal with a couple of those points when I come to my personal explanation as to the way in which both Senator Faulkner and Senator Schacht&mdash;and I am not surprised that they should do so&mdash;both chose deliberately to misrepresent the facts and my position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Macdonald very clearly and ably pointed out that the demeanour of the Parliament and the respect in which the Parliament is held has been denigrated by the actions and the behaviour of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)&mdash;the Prime Minister who was deliberately picked because he could head kick and use bad language. As he very often does, Senator Cooney came into the debate with good intentions. But he, too, tended to get a bit muddled with the issues that were at hand&mdash;and, again, I will deal with those when I point out how I was misrepresented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Baume has made out a case and shown that the Prime Minister is probably the richest Prime Minister that this country has ever had. Not only that, the Prime Minister then has the hide to try to turn around and denigrate somebody who has made his fortune, or good fortune, through dint of personal effort and acumen. At the same time, the Prime Minister's filed returns simply do not show how it was possible for an investment of $430,000 to suddenly turn into something worth $4.2m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other day when Senator Baume asked Senator Tate to investigate the matter or have the Australian Securities Commission investigate the matter, he did the usual thing of answering, `Can't possibly do that; it wouldn't be proper', when it is quite clearly in the interests of the people to have those questions answered.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On two occasions today I have foreshadowed that I had been misrepresented both by Senator Faulkner and Senator Schacht. I have noted on one or two occasions that, when Senator Faulkner becomes agitated, he tends to become a little intemperate in his language. So when he chose to use words that others might not use and tried to insult me, he got his facts wrong too.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would firstly point out that on Monday I asked Senator Button whether he would ascertain if an inquiry concerning a Labor Party member in the New South Wales Parliament was to be pursued with the same Smiles-like vigour, or whether it was to be treated with the same preferential treatment as the Prime Minister has had&mdash;this time with regard to his personal tax returns. That was a completely proper question to ask. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had made the case, and made it clearly, that there is great concern in the general public at the manner in which the Australian Taxation Office persecutes ordinary Australians. From time to time I am going to bring into this chamber examples of exactly how that has been done. Indeed, the lady from Bass Hill, who I cited earlier, is just one of those cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Faulkner said that I had handed over an envelope which contained a press release or a press transcript. Wrong! I handed over a letter which contained the name of the Labor member of parliament concerned because on previous occasions when I have sought information from the Australian Tax Office, I have not got an accurate answer; I have got a clever answer where the Commissioner has chosen to be a bit confused about precisely what I wanted. I did not want that to occur on this occasion, so I gave the name. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the second point, the following day when I received the letter from Mr Dawkins, which was totally unsatisfactory, I came into the chamber and I said for four very particular reasons that I was tabling a document which was a transcript of a news item on the ABC because there was now beginning to be some speculation as to which member of parliament it was. That was precisely the point that Senator Faulkner had made&mdash;that innocent people or people who were not involved were being discussed. For precisely that reason I put into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> what was already on the public record in another area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, Senator Schacht chose to make the same errors. Of course, he probably was not present. He is quite often away from the chamber and does not choose to come in very often, so he probably was not here when it occurred. Again, he is a man who seems to be concerned about everybody's human rights as long as it is the collective. But it is a different matter when we get down to the rights of an individual Australian&mdash;somebody who is being oppressed and has nowhere to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, great numbers of ordinary Australians are writing to me and seeking help because they are helpless and have nowhere else to go. Last night, for instance, I had one phone call from a lady who was living on Central Station. She has nowhere else to go, no-one else to ask for help. I have yet to investigate what I can do to help her. But there are thousands upon thousands of ordinary Australians out there who feel that in a competition with the bureaucracy they come stone dead last. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we raise questions in this Parliament about every Australian being entitled to an even go and a fair go, it means they have to be assured that we are not seeing a politicised Public Service operating in a way which is not fair and even-handed, let alone competent.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to put the record straight in regard to the accusation that I am not often in the chamber. That is true. I, like all senators, have many commitments outside this chamber with committees and so on.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This means that I am not in the chamber perhaps as often as Senator Bishop or some other senators are.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable senator also made some remarks about my being more interested in the collective than the individual. I must say that on every parliamentary delegation I have been involved in representing this Parliament overseas, and on private visits to various countries overseas, I have, almost without exception, raised individual human rights on behalf of individual cases that I am aware of. Names are supplied by Amnesty International, Asia Watch and the human rights section of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and other names are raised by members of the Australian community. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Student Assistance Amendment Bill seeks to amend the Student Assistance Act 1973. The Act provides the statutory basis for the AUSTUDY scheme, which since its introduction in 1987 has been a purely grants-based scheme. It also provides a debt management regime for ABSTUDY and the Assistance for Isolated Children Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has one of the world's best student financial support schemes, which is one reason we have one of the world's most equitable higher education systems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since 1983</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the number of secondary students in receipt of income support has increased by 350%</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the number of tertiary recipients has increased by 125%</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the real value of maximum benefits has increased by 11% for tertiary students and 115% for secondary students.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is committed to building on these achievements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill, and other improvements announced in the Budget, will make a good scheme even better.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AUSTUDY/ABSTUDY Supplement</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The major provision in the Bill is to provide for the introduction in 1993 of a Supplement to AUSTUDY and ABSTUDY which will give students greater flexibility in meeting their financial needs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Supplement will be repayable under very favourable conditions, which I will describe shortly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As announced by the Treasurer in his Budget speech, the Supplement will be available to tertiary students who are eligible for grants through AUSTUDY or ABSTUDY. The Supplement will not be available to secondary students. Students will gain access to the Supplement by "trading in" $1 of their grant to secure $2 of the Supplement. In each year, the amount of Supplement available to a student will be between $500 and $4000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Supplement will also extend to tertiary students who would otherwise be eligible for a grant except that their parental income is too high, where that income is less than $50 000. This group of students will need to satisfy all other eligibility criteria for either AUSTUDY or ABSTUDY, and will have access to between $500 and $2000 each year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Voluntary nature of the Supplement</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A major point to note about the Supplement is that it is voluntary. The Bill provides that the real value of grants under AUSTUDY will be maintained by the continuation of indexation of maximum living allowances. The Supplement will, therefore, provide an opportunity for students to gain access to additional financial resources if they so choose.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is aware that students' financial needs vary considerably. For example, rents in Sydney are far higher than in many parts of Australia; the availability of part-time or vacation work differs significantly from one region to another; some courses have significantly higher costs for books and materials than others; parents with the same incomes may differ in their willingness and ability to support their student children.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not possible to design a grant scheme which takes into account all these significant differences. The Supplement will give students access to more resources at their own choice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Provision of the Supplement</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill provides for the Government to undertake a competitive process for the Supplement to be provided to eligible students by the private financial sector. It is envisaged that an initial contract will be signed with a financial corporation for a five-year period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth will pay interest on each Supplement for five years. At the end of five years, the Commonwealth will assume responsibility for un-repaid Supplements from the financial institution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Employment, Education and Training will continue to assess students' eligibility for AUSTUDY or ABSTUDY, and will provide students with an Application for Supplement Form if they are eligible. Students can then enter an agreement with the financial institution if they wish to take up the Supplement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Supplement will be paid to students on a fortnightly basis, in tandem with their AUSTUDY or ABSTUDY grants where these are also being received.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Repayment conditions</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supplement recipients will be able to choose to make repayments during the five year period leading up to the Commonwealth taking over outstanding amounts. Such repayments will attract a discount of 15%.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After the Commonwealth has taken over the liability, former recipients of the Supplement will be required to make repayments through the Australian Taxation Office in a similar manner to the repayment of Higher Education Contributions (HECS) through the taxation system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, in the 1992-93 income year repayments are set at 2% of taxable income from $27 748 to $31 532, 3% of taxable income from $31 533 to $44 146 and 4% of taxable income of $44 147 or more. Those taxable income thresholds are indexed annually to movements in the Consumer Price Index so that, when the first Supplement repayments are made through the taxation system in 1997-98, the Supplement repayment thresholds will be the same as for HECS. Appropriate amendments are being made to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Supplement recipient whose taxable income does not reach the first threshold in a particular year will not be required to make a repayment in that year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No interest on repayments</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recipients of the Supplement will not be charged a real interest rate. Outstanding balances will, however, be indexed on an annual basis to movements in the Consumer Price Index to maintain their real value. Even taking into account the up-front cost to those students required to trade-in all or part of their grant to gain access to the Supplement, these conditions compare very favourably with commercial loans.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the likely earnings of students after they complete their studies, and taking into account the 15% discount offered for repayments in the first five years, the Supplement will be an attractive proposition for many students. In most cases, it will be much more favourable than any commercial loan available to students.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indexation provisions</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Student groups who have demonstrated against the introduction of student loans have not been able to put forward any convincing argument against the details of the Supplement which the Government is to introduce. However, there is genuine concern among students that the introduction of the Supplement could be used to subsequently reduce access to student grants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For this reason, the Bill seeks to legislate the indexation procedures which have been followed since the introduction of AUSTUDY in 1987.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To achieve this, the Bill includes provision to index maximum allowances under AUSTUDY to movements in the Consumer Price Index.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Data-Matching </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Data-Matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990, student assistance is included in the Data Matching Program. The Bill will amend the Data-Matching Act to include the AUSTUDY/ ABSTUDY Supplement in the student assistance provisions covered by that Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Financial impact</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government expects that more than 100,000 students will take up the Supplement in 1993, rising to about 150,000 in 1994 and more than 180,000 in 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only early-year Commonwealth outlays will be contractual obligations, primarily comprising interest payments to the financial institution and compensation to that institution for discounts provided for early repayments. Significant savings will be generated to the Budget as students "trade in" all or part of their AUSTUDY/ABSTUDY grant to gain access to the Supplement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In real terms, the Supplement is estimated to produce Budget savings in all years except for a short period following the commencement of the Commonwealth purchase of outstanding amounts. Savings will rise to over $150 million per year by 2002-03, as repayments through the taxation system increase.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Budget savings are estimated to be $42 million in 1992-93, rising to almost $115 million in 1993-94 and $138 million in 1994-95.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill introduces major reforms to financial assistance for students in Australia. Students' access to financial support at the time it is needed will be greatly enhanced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I note that two other enhancements to AUSTUDY were announced in the Budget speech, and will be introduced by way of amendments to the AUSTUDY Regulations. These are, firstly, a progressive reduction in the age of independence&mdash;that is, the age at which the parental income test no longer applies&mdash;from 25 now to 22 in 1995. The second enhancement is an increase in the personal income test threshold from $5000 now to $6000 in 1993.</PARA>

In addition, it attracted a delegation from the House of Lords led by Lord Thurlow. This indicates the level and also the breadth of interest in the work of the Committee. The seminar was addressed by an impressive array of speakers, including the President. Others to address the seminar included the Committee's first legal adviser, Professor Dennis Pearce, former members of the Committee Senator Robert Hill and the Hon.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">TABLING STATEMENT&mdash;PRESENTATION OF COMMITTEE REPORT&mdash;SENATOR JOHN DEVEREUX</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">OFFICE CONSTRUCTION AT SECTION 45, BELCONNEN, ACT </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's Ninth report for 1992 deals with the construction of a five-storey office building in the Canberra suburb of Belconnen. The building will be occupied by the ACT regional office of the Australian Taxation Office.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will have a gross floor area of 22,000 square metres of which 14,100 square metres will be for offices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ground floor of the building will contain public access areas and an automatic document dispatch centre. The four upper storeys will contain office areas and staff amenities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated completed cost of the building will not exceed $40.9 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report recommends that the work should proceed, and also recommends a number of features being incorporated in the design. These involve the installation of a gas cogeneration plant to provide electrical power to the building, the installation of a dimmed lighting, as opposed to a switched control lighting system, the removal of fill from the site and landscaping.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of arguments were advanced which purported to demonstrated that the use of a gas cogeneration plant in the building would not be practical or economic. The Committee remains unconvinced about the weight of these arguments and has recommended that a gas cogeneration plant be installed. A gas cogeneration plant has a number of environmental benefits and its installation in a building owned by the Commonwealth will be a reflection of the Government's commitment to energy conservation and to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has recommended that the building be provided with an automatic light dimming system. The system adjusts light levels automatically to compensate for the amount of daylight reaching the inside of the building. On bright sunny days, the lights are automatically dimmed, and on overcast days or during darkness, the light intensity is automatically increased. The Committee believes this method of lighting control is far superior to a switched control system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The site contains a large amount of fill which will need to be removed before excavation can commence. The Committee has recommended that the contract for the removal of the fill should not preclude its sale by the successful tenderer. Nevertheless, the final destination of the fill should be determined and if it is offered for sale, the cost of its removal should be adjusted accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee questioned the extent and cost of landscaping proposed and has recommended that the scope of landscaping be reduced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In view of its current heavy workload, the Committee has decided to table a short report recommending that the work proceed and enabling Australian Estate Management to adhere to its construction timetable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It must nevertheless be made clear that the Committee is seriously concerned about being placed in this situation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I make the following points in this regard lest there is any subsequent comment about the Committee's processes causing delays to the commencement of public works.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In late January Australian Estate Management requested the Committee to approve the commencement of design and documentation and preliminary tender negotiations. The Committee agreed with this in late February. AEM was hoping for an early hearing into the proposal and for the Committee's report to be tabled before the winter recess.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposal was not referred to the Committee until 25 June too late for the Committee to conduct its public hearing and present its report before the winter adjournment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 15 July Australian Estate Management sought the Committee's approval to call tenders for the excavation and foundation works in advance of the report being tabled in Parliament. The Committee's approval to do this was given on 28 July. The Committee at this time was optimistic that its report could be tabled by mid-October.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, because of the large number of references which had been received by the Committee in the intervening months, which tended to rearrange the timetable of hearings and report preparation, and over which the Committee has very little control, the Committee was unable to meet this deadline.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 28 September Australian Estate Management sought the Committee's approval to award the earth works contract in advance of the tabling of the Committee's report. The provisions of the Public Works Committee Act do not permit this course of action being followed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This highlights the need for all departments and agencies to adhere closely to planned milestones during the development of a proposal. In this instance, AEM was planning proceeded on the basis of a favourable report from the Committee before the winter adjournment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee believes the time has come to give the strongest possible signal to all departments and agencies that, in future, it will not have imposed on it unreasonable and unrealistic schedules which presuppose peremptory inquiries and approval of works.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the report to the Senate.</PARA>

As a member of the Joint Committee on Public Works, I would like to make the point that over the last few weeks&mdash;in fact over the last couple of months&mdash;there has been a tremendous amount of pressure on the Public Works Committee to push through projects that have been in the pipeline for some time. No doubt government departments and the like want to clear the decks before the election next year, and I wish to pay a compliment to the staff who have gone out of their way to accommodate the extra pressures that have been put on them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, the matter of the Belconnen Tax Office should have come before us earlier. It is through no fault of the Public Works Committee that we have had to go out of our way to approve this building. We have had sittings outside normal times and do all sorts of things that we normally do not do in order to accommodate the Tax Office. This interim report, if it can be called that, had to be rushed through to allow work to start on this building. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been quite a few reservations about certain parts of the building. My colleague Senator Devereux has raised matters relating to the electrical aspects of the building; Senator Burns has raised questions about the tremendous cost of landscaping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A fair amount of evidence&mdash;I think Senator Reid would be interested in this, although she is not in the chamber&mdash;was given to us by the national planning body and the ACT planning body with regard to some concerns about whether Belconnen was the right location for the ACT Tax Office. They suggested that it might have been more appropriate to put the national Tax Office in Belconnen and the ACT Tax Office in Civic. One would have thought that the headquarters of a Tax Office that is providing a service to the ACT would be located in what is acknowledged as the centre of the ACT, that is, Civic, rather than all the way out at Belconnen. But the powers that be decided that that was where it was to go. They even went to the trouble of conducting a poll to justify their locating this particular building at Belconnen. </PARA>

I suppose that, further down the track, if the national office gets bigger or vice versa they could swap buildings, but it just seems to me that there has been an awful rush and tear to get this particular building approved.

We have had considerable debate on policy issues and the matters of detail flowing from the Budget decisions until now, but this is the first time the Senate has commenced debating the Appropriation Bills which comprise the Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These Bills should be renamed the Bankcard Bills because they are Bills that seek to spend now and pay later. It is a clear indication of the way in which the Government sees the operation of fiscal policy. This Government has worked continually over recent years to attempt to buy our way out of trouble. Of course, the opposite will actually happen because one cannot buy one's way out of trouble. By attempting to do that, one simply buys one's way into still deeper problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These Bills constitute no more than an election bribe. These Bills were formulated on the basis that the Government may wish to run to an early election before Christmas this year. But even if that were not the case, it would engage in a big spending binge that would continue through the year and which, in the Government's own analysis, would attempt to pork barrel and pump prime the economy to try to get, at least temporarily, some of the one million unemployed Australians off the official lists and attempt to make the economy look vastly better than it is. We all know, as history has shown, that that leads to more and more intractable problems and a more difficult set of circumstances for our nation to try to work its way out of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These Bills signal the misguided use of fiscal policy which, as I said, has been the hallmark of recent Labor Budgets. The only thing we can breathe easy about with this Budget by this Labor Government is that it will be its last. </PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) knows that this is a false and totally wrong use of fiscal policy. Just look at what he said in earlier Budget Speeches when he was the Treasurer. In his Budget Speech in 1986-87 he stated:</PARA>

<PARA>What a joke those statements have proved to be. What absolute falsehoods they have proved to be, because the Government has never at any time followed the edicts that are implied in those Budget Speeches. Those sentiments, very proper sentiments, very correct sentiments, sentiments of fiscal responsibility and prudence in government management, were never intended by this Government to be followed by performance. Instead, they have been thrown out of the window. It has all become far too hard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government has run out of steam. This Government is in disarray. This Government does not know where it is going on policy, and that has been reflected in the latest Budget&mdash;in the Bills we are debating now&mdash;and it has been all too evident over the last couple of years. That is why, two days before the 1990 election just 2 1/2 years ago, the then Treasurer Keating and then Prime Minister Hawke both said to the Australian people, `There won't be a recession'. Indeed, the then Treasurer said, `We will not let there be a recession'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Less than nine months after that, we were plunged into a very deep recession indeed. It was a recession that, for a long period of time, Mr Keating, as Treasurer, refused to acknowledge. He kept trying to talk the economy up at a time when the economy was obviously plunging down very rapidly. At the end of several months he was forced to say, because reality dictated that he could not do otherwise, that, yes, we did have a recession, yes, it was a recession we had to have and, `yes, it was a recession that I, Paul Keating, engineered'. But, he said, `I pulled the levers that got this nation into the recession. I'll pull the levers and we'll pull the nation out of recession'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two years later we are still in a very deep recession. Prime Minister Keating tried to tell us last week that the recession was long gone. That is absolute nonsense, as he well knows. If the one million unemployed people and the further one million Australians who are either underemployed or who have simply dropped out of the work force in despair at ever finding a job are asked whether this recession is long behind us and long gone, they will tell the truth. They will say that of course that is not true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, jobs are still being lost and unemployment is still as high as it ever was. Employment is continuing to fall, as are the living standards of all Australians. We now have 700,000 children who live in families where neither parent has a job. Last night I heard Julian Disney say on ABC's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS>&mdash;honourable senators may have heard it&mdash;that to have a full time job in Australia today is to be a privileged Australian. No more stark indictment than that statement could be made of the policies of the Hawke and Keating Labor governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should not be a privilege to have a full time job in Australia; it should be a right. We have the talents, resources, skills and geographic location in the world&mdash;we have everything going for us that we need to be a vibrant, growing, healthy nation where unemployment is not a scourge at all. Yet we are amongst those countries in the Western world with the highest unemployment rate, and that has been the case now for almost two years. We still have almost the highest real interest rates in the Western world. We also have the slowest and worst growth performance of virtually any country in the Western world&mdash;indeed, for much of the last couple of years we have had negative growth&mdash;let alone all those other countries that are newly developing, such as the tigers of Asia and elsewhere, where the growth rates outstrip those in our nation several times over. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are still almost at the bottom of the list in terms of the increase in productivity of our work force and resources as a whole. While we are in that situation we continue to become increasingly uncompetitive internationally. The longer we remain uncompetitive internationally, the more intractable our problems become. Yet we have a government which knows that the path to international competitiveness can only be the path of massive and major change in this country&mdash;of great reform of our institutions and of the way that we go about doing things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Button&mdash;the third most senior Minister in the Government&mdash;said recently that the amount of micro-economic reform that has been achieved by this Government is such that there is a limit to the further capacity of the Australian people to cope with or to absorb further reform. What absolute nonsense! What a cruel joke that is on the people of Australia, particularly those two million people who, as I said before, are officially unemployed, underemployed or who have dropped out of the work force in despair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been said by many commentators, the way out of our problems is not to try to pump up the economy through wild spending increases for which there is not the money to pay. That is what the Government has done in this Budget and that is what these appropriation Bills are about. Although they deal only with the expenditure side of government, equally, they can only be looked at alongside the measures to raise revenue. The bottom line is that, this year, the Government is proposing to spend $13.4 billion more than it is able to raise. That is more than it forecasts it is able to raise. Even that revenue estimate relies on a rate of growth of the economy as a whole that most commentators would say is very unlikely to be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had admissions to this effect from Senator Button and others in recent days. Senator Button's classic, honest admission on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program on Channel 9 last Sunday was that the prospect of achieving the growth forecasts for this year is not all that bright. No matter how he has tried to use weasel words to change what he really said last Sunday, there is no way that he can get out of that admission. And he is quite right. If he is correct in the outcome and growth for this year is less than is forecast in the Budget, revenue will be even less than is forecast and the Budget deficit of $13.4 billion will be even greater. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That deficit, which is the published deficit, is absolutely huge. Being a published deficit, it really understates the true deficit, because it is struck after taking account of certain one-off, unusual, extraordinary items. Those items, such as the proceeds of asset sales, are increasingly, day by day, unlikely to be realised. If the proceeds of assets sales, the extraordinary profits that the Reserve Bank has made on foreign exchange and other dealings and a couple of other similar one-off items are set aside, the true Budget deficit this year, on the Government's own figures, is not $13.4 billion but $20.5 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That means that, to meet the hole in its Budget this year, the Government will have to borrow something in the order of $25,000m. That is an enormous amount of money that has to be found. If the Government follows its pattern of the most recent years and attempts to find that money on the domestic capital markets, it will simply crowd out all the other private sector borrowers who, hopefully, might be looking for some funds in the course of 1992-93 if and when there is any recovery. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment, there is no sign of light at the end of the tunnel as far as the economy is concerned. Labour shedding continues in large degree and investment continues to fall, particularly private sector productive investment. Consumer demand is very flat, as we have seen from recent retail sales figures. In the economies of the major nations&mdash;the United States, Japan and some of the European nations&mdash;the outlook economically is very bleak. The OECD is in the process of revising downwards its forecast of economic growth in the world economy over the next 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at all the factors&mdash;our increasingly low level of productivity, the Government having given up completely on micro-economic reform and the fiscal irresponsibility contained in this Budget&mdash;we would have to say that the prospects of any discernible recovery in the Australian economy over this financial year are very bleak indeed. One cannot pump prime and expect to get results. Max Walsh very correctly pointed out recently:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact is that the harder we try to pump up the economy, the more it droops. We cannot rely on discredited Keynesian pump priming techniques to grow faster than the rest of the world.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a hard lesson which Treasurer Dawkins has not yet learnt. Senator Button, in his recent admissions on growth, is closer to the mark, but nobody in the Government wants to hear the truth about their failed policies. The Government cannot ignore the signals from the market forever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already mentioned some of the indicators of the state of the economy. Foreign investors, for example, have marked down the dollar since the Budget. Since the 1991 Budget, just 14 months ago, the Australian dollar has been marked down by a massive 14 per cent. As I said before, long term interest rates are at the highest real level in the OECD. Recently reported survey results show that many private and academic economists are slicing their economic growth forecasts and taking Senator Button's view that growth could undercut Federal Government predictions, with all the consequences that I have already outlined for revenue, the Government's borrowing requirements and the like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite every indication to the contrary, the Government is trying to make the best of its fiscal ineptitude by sweeping such unpleasant signals under the carpet. The Prime Minister is interested only in the populist route until the next election. Gone are the days when he is even prepared to say that he is going to govern responsibly and that he is prepared to try to outline policies which demonstrate a possibility and a capacity to govern and show leadership. In the past all those fond words have been swept away in the actuality of performance. There has always been the rhetoric, but the performance has never followed through. Now even the rhetoric is starting to look as tattered as it rightly should. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the real problems and the real circumstances facing Australia, the need for a whole new budgetary fiscal policy is undeniable. The Prime Minister underestimates the extent to which people can see through the bribe smokescreen contained in this Budget. One of the biggest bribes was made in grants to local governments this year, with Victoria, my own State, getting over 40 per cent of the total of those grants to local governments in 1992-93. There was only one reason why it got a proportion of that magnitude. It was a desperate attempt by the Keating Government to try to save the Kirner Government in Victoria. But the Kirner Government was totally unsavable. The election results in Victoria were as clear an indication as one could get of how people are not hoodwinked by such shonky politicking and the rest of Australia is unlikely to be impressed by being asked to fund the policy errors of the Kirner Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at some of the startlingly irresponsible facts of the present financial position in Australia. As I said before, if we look at the Budget outcome after adjustments for all the one-off fiddles so that comparisons can be made on a comparable basis, we see that the underlying Budget deficit this year is in excess of $20,000m. That is 5 per cent or more of our total national income. That figure, as a proportion of our national income&mdash;that deficit, that hole in the Budget&mdash;is twice as large as the deficit that was there at the start of the Labor years. It even exceeds the figure in the worst of the Whitlam years. The Senate may recall that the financial sins of the Whitlam years caused many of the problems with which Australia is still grappling today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Panizza says, one can argue that we are in the twentieth year of the Whitlam Government. The point I want to make is that we thought the Whitlam Government was a highly profligate government. In fact, when it comes to looking at these figures, the Keating Government is the most profligate government in the history of this nation. In many respects, it makes the Whitlam Government look positively good.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said before, as a result of this gross mismanagement and policy failures, we have a financing requirement which will involve the largest bond issuing program in Australia's history. That represents a massive drain on national savings because it means that the Government is putting its sticky fingers in the cookie jar of Australia's savings and drawing those savings out for its own use because of its own irresponsibilities and leaving that jar of savings so much more depleted for the private sector&mdash;the productive sector, the job creating sector&mdash;to draw from. That will put a major upward thrust on interest rates and a millstone around taxpayers' necks for years and years through the increase that that causes in the interest bill on our public debt. That millstone would continue to grow if Labor was around long enough to implement its multitude of unfunded promises which were a purely political attempt to match the fully funded, very responsibly financed promises and commitments contained in the coalition's package of policy reforms and proposals collectively known as Fightback. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The essential difference between the policy proposals of the coalition and those of the Government are that all of our proposals involve some major tax cuts. They involve a 30 per cent reduction in personal income tax and the abolition of seven major taxes on the cost of producing goods and services in this nation. Wholesale sales tax in particular will be abolished under the coalition's proposals. Payroll tax, which is no more than a tax on jobs, will be totally abolished. The tax on fuel will be totally abolished. That means that businesses will pay 25c a litre less for their fuel and private motorists will pay 19c a litre less for their fuel.

That is a document which has sunk without trace. It was not a statement about one nation; it was really a statement about one job.

That is certainly correct, because the Government could not even write the Budget Bills which came into the Parliament properly. Incidentally, we were supposed to debate these Bills yesterday. Why are we debating them today? It is because the Government could not even put them down properly in black and white. This is an example of sloppy drafting on the part of the Government and it shows the disarray the Government is in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to what the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) in the other place used as an excuse. Mr Rocher told the House of Representatives that there had been a complete stuff-up in what was the most important legislation introduced into Parliament in any one year&mdash;the Government could not even get the Budget Papers right. By way of explanation, the Minister said that Appropriation Bill (No. 1) was meant to authorise expenditure from Consolidated Revenue of $14,761m and Appropriation Bill (No. 2) was meant to appropriate about $6 billion. In defending the situation, Mr Brown said that the Department of Finance had advised that the amount to be appropriated in the Supply Bills Nos 3 and 4 had been `inadvertently transposed'. In other words, the figure of one was confused with the figure of the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Brown went on to say, `I should emphasise that these amendments are of a technical nature'. The Government mistook $14 billion for $6 billion and then the Minister said that the amendments were of a `technical nature'. That is how this Government is operating these days. It is in total disarray and its Budget is in total disarray. I am interpreting your smile, Mr Acting Deputy President, as accentuating what I am saying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Budget comes down in any year, the first thing I look for is how it treats rural and remote areas and what is in it for those people. Even more importantly, I look at what is not in the Budget for those people. I am afraid that this year I have not found very much of importance for them. This year, with farm viability at probably its lowest level ever, I thought that the Budget would contain some measures which would improve viability, employment and the quality of life of country people so that they could enjoy the same quality of life which is expected and demanded anywhere else in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we find that, especially in the eastern States, we have come through the worst financial year ever. In the eastern States, broad acre farms have had a net loss of some $44,000 in the financial year just ended. An improvement is expected in this financial year when we will hopefully get over the drought in the eastern States which has so badly affected western New South Wales and some parts of Queensland. But even allowing for that improvement, the average broad acre farm, in the eastern States at least, has a longstanding debt of $400,000. That is unbearable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the western side of the continent, at least, we have had a far better season. In fact, it is probably the best season we have experienced for 30 years. But of course the glow from that is diminished by other things. At present, there is nothing in this Budget for those rural and remote areas and there is very little for the mining sector, which I will come to a little later in my remarks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year we had a Budget deficit of $9.9 billion, after an estimate of $4.7 billion. This year we have an estimated deficit of $13.4 billion&mdash;and this Bill will fund that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there is very little in this Budget for primary industry. It has been the worst year on record for the eastern States. Expenditure on the primary industry part of the Budget is down by $97.8m. If one has a cursory read of the primary industry section of the Budget, one will see that spending of some $1.76 billion has been allocated to that area, but $774m of that is farmers' own research levies which have been recirculated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other $438m, which is the diesel fuel rebate, is considered by the Government to be a handout to primary industry. It is forgone receipts. The point is that the excise on diesel fuel is for fuel used on roads. If fuel is used on a farm, the excise is not collected. How can anyone sit there and say that this is an allocation to primary industry? It is not; so it should not be considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Putting that aside&mdash;that is not an allocation to primary industry&mdash;what is allocated out of the Government Budget is $551.7m which is, as I said, down $97.8m on last year.

We are starting to get the stockpile down. The price, especially of the broader wools, is starting to go up. I can see a future there. I can also see a better future for the beef industry and for horticulture, especially with the expanded output. We are presently having problems with the GATT Round, or the failure of the GATT Round, and with the activities of the European Community and the United States, leading up to the election, concerning the trade subsidies that have been put on wheat and other grain products which are depressing the price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fortunately, I suppose, for Australian growers&mdash;very unfortunately for Canadian and European growers of grain&mdash;there has been one of the worst finishes to the season in most of Europe, including Britain, and in Canada caused by late rains. The damage has caused a reduction in a lot of their better quality wheat, although their better quality wheat is not as good as our feed wheat. That will enable Australian wheat growers to receive a better price than was expected when the European and United States subsidies came into full effect. The election in the United States will be over before very long and things will settle down and President Bush's $US1.5 billion will have been expended, at which time I hope the wheat industry will turn around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) announced the other day that the Australian Wheat Board is to remain as it is until 1999. I never quite knew where Mr Crean was going with the Wheat Board. I did not know whether he had an agenda to destroy the Wheat Board or the Grains Council of Australia, which is supposed to represent the wheat growers of Australia. I did not know what sort of agenda its peak body had. The Export Grains Association of Australia and the Export Grain Sellers of Australia in the private sector certainly did have an agenda. But Mr Crean, to his credit, has seen the problems being experienced with the trade subsidy around the world and has decided to leave the Wheat Board as it is until 1999. </PARA>

Mr Crean accused the coalition of a sham policy on wheat, saying that wheat would receive special treatment. There is no special treatment. The deal with the coalition, supported by both parties, is exactly the same as that which the Government has decided upon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The confusion seems to be that Mr Crean and Mr Harry Woods do not know the difference between price underwriting and guaranteed minimum price.

However, he says there is division in the Opposition because we are trying to bring in a guaranteed minimum price. We are not doing anything of the sort.

The same obstacles are being placed in the way of any new mining venture that is trying to get off the ground in the Kimberleys, for the same reasons as in the Pilbara. This Government and some Labor State governments around Australia are looking at the endangered species legislation. No doubt the legislation will be supported by radical groups. In legislation such as taxation legislation, there is what is called a catch-all clause; that is, if part of the legislation does not catch someone there is a catch-all clause. I am afraid that is what will happen with this endangered species legislation. If the mining industry cannot develop some deposit of gold or iron ore, that clause will be used. We had the charade at Marandoo. That project was held up for two years. That was supposed to be in a national park. That was as appealing as a national park as is the Sahara Desert. </PARA>

All of a sudden, after this briefing, he has been converted. In fact, he asked me whether I was going to support it. I have been supporting it for five years, since they got the idea going. Obviously, he did not find the endangered species down there that he has been trying to find everywhere else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appreciate the $1m that the Government has allocated for Compact Steel. Not only will it provide export income from a million tonnes of steel to South East Asia, but it will also provide 300 to 500 permanent jobs a year in the long term. There is Italian involvement in it, German involvement and Chinese, and there will probably be others by the time it is finished. I commend the Government for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now move to land transport. The basic budget has always been from this Government, static as it may be, about $1.4 billion.

We are really looking at an ongoing situation of around that figure until it is improved by our Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sum of $7 billion is dragged from road transport in fuel levies, as I have said before, yet road funding is stagnant while the collection from levies is always increasing.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now turn to the other side of land transport, and that is the National Rail Corporation. In the Budget last year $40m was allocated. Rail is a mode of transport that has tended to be neglected and it has to get back on the rails, if I may say so. What does the Government do? It allocated $40m and only $8.9m was spent. That was because of the late start of the National Rail Corporation because the Government and the unions could not get their act together. They reckoned they were going to get it together later and get it moving. This year there was an allocation of $162m. I am wondering how it will be spent and whether it is just put in the Budget as a figure that can be used somewhere else with the excuse, again, that the National Rail Corporation, because of union problems between union members, cannot really get going. </PARA>

But the cry that comes from Western Australia is, `Okay, this money has been allocated, but where is it?'.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rail can do with improvement.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Budget has certainly done nothing for small business. The only thing small business has is plenty of disincentives. Anyone in small business who employs labour knows what has to be done and that by the time you do your PAYE, by the time you do your FBT and by the time you do all those other statutory things you have to, free on behalf of the Government, there is very little time for everything else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has been foisted on business this year through legislation in this place are things like the contractors legislation, and the superannuation levy legislation which brought everyone under an umbrella at 3 per cent, 4 per cent and later 5 per cent of wages. There is the training levy that has to be adhered to. Incidentally, most of that training levy is spent on travelling rather than training.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we can't do four per cent, we ought to pack it in, the lot of us. What sort of country do we want to live in? You need about three per cent a year just to take the school leavers up.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What a statement: `If we can't do 4 per cent we ought to pack it in'. I would invite the Government to do so. Give a go to people who have a plan to see the economy turn around, to see individual Australians prosper again and to see our international debt stabilised. Give us a go. One of the reasons that Mr Keating has been trying to  talk up the growth forecasts after the Budget&mdash;and why Senator Button obviously had pangs of guilt and came out with the truth&mdash;is that he has to some how substantiate that statement he made back in February. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One could say that the growth predictions that this Government has come out with since One Nation, the Budget and subsequent statements by Ministers, is probably the shortest life of any financial forecasting we have ever seen. It is truly amazing to see that between February and August the Government, of its own volition, read down its forecasts from 4.75 per cent to 3 per cent. I repeat the Prime Minister's comments: `What sort of a country do we want to live in? If we can't do 4 per cent we ought to pack it in'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us go on to look at the outcome. Mr Dawkins's Budget made no genuine attempt to face up to Australia's real economic problems such as unemployment, an inefficient tax system, low levels of national savings and poor productivity. Instead, this Budget has been a crude exercise in Keynesian pump-priming in the hope that an expansion in government expenditure will hide a few unemployment statistics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the Budget Papers, the Government has anticipated a Budget deficit of $13.4 billion. For weeks the Government was trying to prepare the market for such a figure, but even this number fails to accurately represent the true Budget deficit. Presumably the $1.6 billion in proceeds from asset sales included the sale of shares in AIDC Ltd. Again, within two weeks of being announced in the Budget, Senator Button denied that the sale would take place simply because AIDC Ltd made a $99m loss. In addition to that, there is $1.1 billion in abnormal profits of the Reserve Bank. So, the published $13.4 billion deficit inflates, probably, to an underlying deficit of around $16.1 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has abandoned its previous commitments to return the Budget to surplus by the end of the decade. Even with indications of increased taxation, the Budget will remain in deficit by 1995-96 and total deficits for 1991-92 to 1995-96 will be over $50 billion, compared to the One Nation estimate of $18 billion for deficits over that period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Either the Government in February in the One Nation statement lied to us, and deliberately did so, or it was so incompetent that Mr Keating ought to heed his words that he gave at the Press Club, `We ought to pack it in'. Quite clearly, the choice is that the Government is either lying or incompetent. Either option is not very attractive and does not give any comfort to the one million unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The turnaround in the Budget deficit in the last two years is bigger than the disastrous Budgets of the Whitlam years and double that during the last recession in 1982-83. This turnaround could prove to be even larger if the Government's estimates of assets sales prove to be unrealistic, and I have already cited one example. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the Government has consistently failed to meet its privatisation targets. Since 1988-89, the Government has made shortfalls on its privatisation targets ranging from $132m to $927m in the last financial year. And not only that, it has managed to screw up the legal rights of Australian citizens along the way, and we remember the pipeline case. This year, the Treasury anticipates $1.6 billion in proceeds from the sale of assets but that includes the sale of Qantas and Australian Airlines. And we have yet to see any evidence of those targets being met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has spent an additional $9 billion this year. This represents a 6 per cent increase in expenditure and signals a massive unfunded spending binge which will have a negligible impact on the one million unemployed. So we are having pain and no gain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Budget is designed to engineer an artificial reduction in unemployment in time for an election. Its aim is not to find jobs for the unemployed but to hide them from the official statistics. It will spend $3.5 billion to create 27,000 jobs and it will hide 43,000 unemployed in training places. Training for what? What is the expectation that this Government offers?  One could say it will mean that Australia will have the best trained dole queues in the world. The Government has forecast that the unemployment figure will fall to 10.5 per cent by July 1993 but at a cost of over $3 billion in additional spending, and we have no guarantee that that figure will be met in any event. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> If returned, Labor would have to impose a massive increase in government taxes and charges to pay for this year's and last year's unfunded spending, not to mention what is in the pipeline. Instead of a sound fiscal blueprint, the Budget is founded upon debt. The gross Commonwealth public debt interest increased by 26 per cent in 1992-93 and 33 per cent in the following year. The interest on public debt will rise by $1 billion this financial year and about $1.5 billion in the following year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Public debt interest will be the largest contributor to the real growth in Budget outlays between now and 1995-96. What a foundation&mdash;debt! This will inevitably lead to a raid on private savings, meagre as they are, and it will not be too long before interest rates will be on the rise so as to further depress investment activity and frustrate any chance of sustainable recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The announced tax increases are only a fraction of what will be required to fund the spending spree and will have little or no effect until 1993-94. The increase in the Medicare levy will yield $300m. Car parking benefits provided to employees will become taxable as fringe benefits from 1 April 1993 and will yield a whole $120m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The immediate increase in excise on tobacco products of $5 a kilogram translates into a rise of 15c to 20c on a packet of cigarettes and provides a whole $80m for the Government in this financial year. New measures for the collection of tax on royalty payments to non-residents will raise $50m in 1993-94; while $115m in the same year will be gained from limiting research and development tax concessions to tax exempt syndicates. These figures are puny. They are puny when contrasted with the Government's spending binge and have caused the need for the announcement of future taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly question the timing of the rise of excise on tobacco products. Within days of that announcement retrenchments by Rothmans in Sydney were announced. The Government does not seem to care about the impact its policies will have on job losses in industry. We saw another example of this in the imposition of the compulsory superannuation levy where we saw jobs disappear immediately. And, of course, subsequently it has had to revise some of the impositions it made with regard to contractors and its tax rulings in that area, realising that all the things that we said in the debate about how unworkable it was and how unfair it was were quite true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to turn to the statement on tax policy which flowed from that Budget and flowed from the exposure by the Opposition that the Government was planning an implementation of new taxes. So I turn to this statement on tax policy and some of the really fascinating things that it says. Accompanying that statement was the Australian Taxation Office income tax compliance enforcement strategy. There was also a so-called confidential minute that accompanied those documents signed by the Commissioner of Taxation. I think what it says is worth putting on the record. It is dated 15 September 1992 and it is to the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins). It says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You have asked for my advice about the extent to which there might be an enhancement or improvement in measures to achieve better compliance with the income tax laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As you know, the income tax system is founded on voluntary compliance principles and is administered on a self assessment basis. Supporting mechanisms are found in systematic approaches (principally the PAYE and TFN systems), and a variety of help and enforcement techniques.</PARA>
<PARA>It is well to point out that over 50 per cent of all taxation revenue collected by the Taxation Office is in fact personal income tax. The minute continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier this year, when addressing the question of a domestic withholding tax on interest I made the general point that it is a tenet of income tax administration that the most efficient and effective means of gathering tax is to have it deducted at source. I indicated that in moving from the general to the particular a range of matters would need to be worked through. Solutions to them involve varying degrees of difficulty, of administration and otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA>It is interesting to note on the question of withholding tax that, in giving evidence to a hearing of the Joint Committee on Public Accounts in Brisbane in the last several weeks, there was an admission by the Taxation Office that a concession given for the payment of withholding tax in respect of people who are bringing in capital for development purposes was simply unenforceable by the Taxation Office and so it did not bother about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Tax Office does bother, however, to persecute&mdash;and I mean persecute&mdash;ordinary small insignificant Australians who have no power to fight back. The Commissioner went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now do not recommend any extension of deduction-at-source systems, either by way of a domestic interest withholding tax or extension of the prescribed payments system. Alternative information reporting procedures, such as the highly successful TFN arrangements, can be very valuable in securing compliance and can obviate the need for further deduction-at-source arrangements. I therefore am recommending some extension of TFN reporting processes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My report on the situation and my recommendations for action, including also our estimates of the resulting gains in revenue, additional to what has been factored into current estimates of revenue receipts, is attached.</PARA>
<PARA>One of the interesting figures that Mr Boucher advised upon, and which the Government has acted upon, is the provision of a so-called $114m to $115m for more staff to bring about greater compliance. The only problem with that statement is that the Taxation Commissioner entered into an agreement with the Public Sector Union&mdash;an agreement which precludes anyone being sacked, with nobody becoming redundant. This is despite the fact that the Tax Office entered into an agreement with the Department of Finance that it would in fact require 3,000 fewer people to collect the revenue once the modernisation system went in. Despite that agreement with the Finance Department, the Commissioner entered into an agreement with the Public Sector Union which says, `Nobody can be made redundant'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, to start with, we have the spectacle of the 1,000 people who are now no longer needed to collect the revenue being transferred to do PR work for the Tax Office. The Tax Office needs that $115m not to employ extra people to do extra audits to get in that little extra bit of tax but to pay the salaries of the people who, under the agreement with the Department of Finance, were to be declared redundant. But under the Public Sector Union agreement, they cannot be made redundant. So the taxpayer is being fooled. The taxpayer is being told that an extra $115m is going to be made available to enable the Tax Office to put on more staff to collect more revenue when, in fact, it is a fudge to pay for the union agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I referred that agreement to the Department of Finance to have it costed. Among other things, this agreement&mdash;a marvellous looking, very glossy document that is registered under section 115&mdash;provides that a trade union advisory unit will be established; that the unit has to have researchers that are funded by the Tax Office; that it has to be provided with a budget for travel and consultants; and that it has to be independent. It also provides that the Taxation Commissioner may not question people on how they spend their time. If they spend all day every day doing union business, they are not allowed to be disciplined or, indeed, queried. Every branch of the Tax Office has to have an office set aside for the union with a locked filing cabinet and a telephone with no bar on it, including ISD for overseas phone calls. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had a preliminary costing back from the Department of Finance which, quite frankly, I find unacceptable. No figure has been put against clause after clause after clause because the Department says it cannot ascertain how much this will cost the taxpayer. But the preliminary finding is that the Commissioner of Taxation has handed over to the Public Sector Union $2 1/2m of taxpayers' money&mdash;and that is for starters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the same Tax Commissioner who wrote to the lady I talked about earlier in the day whose husband had died. He could not tell her or her solicitors what money was owing for the purposes of putting in a return. But the Tax Office was going to sue her for $290. She said, `All I have got in the bank is $2,000 and I cannot even pay for my own funeral'. The same man who writes to ordinary Australians like that has given to the Public Sector Union at least a minimum of $2 1/2m of taxpayers' money. One could say that he wants to get blood out of a stone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to understand that the Labor Party is merely the political wing of the trade union movement and that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) is a good trade union supporter.

I can understand why those opposite think it is fine that the trade union movement should be given taxpayers' money and that ordinary Australians should be penalised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This just highlights, does it not, the ends to which this Government has politicised the Public Service. We have the Commissioner recommending and saying that this money will be made available for additional staff to recoup $1.7 billion worth of additional revenue&mdash;and, quite frankly, if they can identify it now, why are they not collecting it now&mdash;when in fact this is money that is needed to pay the salaries of people who should have been made redundant but will not be because of this Public Sector Union agreement. How can we believe any of the statistics that come from this Government?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said right at the beginning of my speech, this Budget has been `discredited'&mdash;and that is a kind word.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, when we look at the Fightback document we see that here is a plan to bring hope back into the Australian community. When I argue about the reforms that this country needs, I argue from a basis of a belief in free enterprise&mdash;free enterprise which guarantees individuals freedom and prosperity. Three of the imperatives that we need to ensure that are, firstly, a stimulus to encourage indigenous savings so that we can pay for our own development; secondly, incentive to become more productive; and, thirdly, reward for effort. Those are the sorts of things that the Fightback package will allow to occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, for me, the fundamental reason I came to this place was to ensure that future generations will enjoy the freedom and the prosperity that I was able to enjoy as I grew up in the Menzies years.

That is what the Government is intending to do. It does not take a great deal of skill to work out that $63.8m is a lot less than $82.9m, about $19m less.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will tell honourable senators about the current year's increase, that is, from the previous year's $67.8m to this year's $82.9m. Let us see how phoney this present figure is. This so-called increase of $13.3m in the current financial year will not go to any sporting organisations, or indeed to the Australian Sports Commission. In fact, the funding of the Australian Sports Commission&mdash;and this is the body that funds Australian sport&mdash;will go up by $300,000. It will go up from $59.3m to $59.6m which, after one accounts for inflation, represents a fall in real terms. A $300,000 rise from $59.3m is a fall in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That fall in real terms is hidden in this substantial increase in the Department's own expenditures, which jumped from $6m to $14m. The real reason for this big increase in the Department's expenditure is very simple. As I said, none of this money will go to the Australian Sports Commission or to Australian sporting organisations, whose funding will have to be cut. In fact, it will spread over additional programs announced by the Minister, because $7.8m of this one-off increase this year is only a carry-over of unspent funds from last year's political stunt, which was called the facilities program. That program does not relate entirely to sport. Quite an amount of that program relates to facilities of a totally different nature. This facilities program is awarded mainly to Labor marginal seats, without reference to the Sports Commission or national sporting organisations. In fact, this is allocated out of the Minister's office on the basis of the nature of the electorate to which it relates. </PARA>

We hope it is successful. Another $300,000 is to pay the legal costs of the Australian Sports Drug Agency, particularly in the Martin Vinnicombe affair. Mr Acting Deputy President, you are well aware of the extraordinary way the Australian taxpayer has had to suffer in financial terms&mdash;and Australian sport has had to suffer in financial terms&mdash;because Mr Vinnicombe, who was caught cheating by taking performance enhancing drugs and who admitted to taking these drugs, has been able to maintain a continual legal pressure because of some legal technicalities relating to the nature of the drug testing by the Canadian authorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is where this big so-called increase has occurred in sports funding&mdash;none of it going to Australian sporting organisations. This is simply the base point from which we find this dishonest attack on the coalition. We see these claims, for example, that we will massively cut funding. I notice that Mr Johns, from the depths of his ignorance about sport, says how ridiculous it is for us to be talking about reducing some of the bureaucracy at the Australian Sports Commission and cutting out some of its remarkable increase in capital spending. He says how ridiculous it is that we are talking about limiting this capital spending by $3m when in fact the capital expenditure in 1992-93 is estimated to be just $1.2m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have news for him. In fact, the Senate Estimates hearing held last week revealed that in 1992-93 the total for capital works and services for the Australian Sports Commission for the current financial year is $2.3m. What the coalition will cut it from&mdash;and we said this clearly in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document&mdash;was the 1991-92 base which was $4.2m.

We are saying it should slow down a bit faster than the Government says it should slow down, but both of us are saying it. For Mr Johns to pretend that that is not happening is simply ludicrous and part of a Labor Party campaign of clear deception about the sports policy of the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unfortunate that sport is now being dragged into the Keating Government's political campaign against the coalition's Fightback plan to rescue Australia from the recession Mr Keating said we had to have. The Keating Government's strategy is to mount a campaign of fear and falsehood against Fightback, even issuing dishonest ministerial documents, paid for by taxpayers, that contain totally untrue allegations about what the coalition's policy is and what its effect on sport and sports funding would be. This then gets repeated by such people as Mr Martin and Mr Johns in the other place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is incredible. We hear Mr Johns, for example, making this sort of totally false statement. He says:</PARA>

<PARA>I have news for him. This Government imposes a 20 per cent sales tax on sporting equipment, and that is to be wiped out under the Fightback policy. But Mr Johns does not have the decency to mention that. In fact, he says exactly the opposite in what can only be either gross ignorance or gross deception. There is no excuse for him not knowing what is in it because he refers to it repeatedly. He can make his choice about which it is, but the facts on funding under a coalition government are that, contrary to Government propaganda,<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">there will be no cuts whatsoever in the total of Federal funding through the Australian Sports Commission to Australian sporting organisations. As Fightback clearly states, funding will be maintained in real terms. This, of course, is in contrast to the Keating Government's cut in real terms to the Sports Commission's program funds in the latest Budget. As I said, the minute increase of $300,000 in its total funding in fact means a reduction in real terms. The Government is actually cutting the Sports Commission's real funding while we of course will not do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge that the coalition does plan cuts to the blatantly political $10m a year community recreation sporting facilities program, which is administered by the Minister herself, on the basis of the political status of the electorate involved without reference to or advice from the Sports Commission or national sporting bodies. And, as I said earlier, much of the resources under that program are now going to things other than sporting facilities. It is true that we will also be cutting further ASC capital works. Such works will not be undertaken after the completion of the present capital works program until the economy improves sufficiently to afford it. I then added an important element which the Government never acknowledges: `or unless private fundraising provides for it'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government has been monumentally incompetent in getting private sector support for the Australian Sports Commission apart from a few ads. One can see exactly what the revenue situation is. The forecast for this year is about $4.9m overall; last year $4.4m was raised. One would have thought that after such a successful Olympics there would have been many organisations wishing to be associated with the Australian Institute of Sport to provide considerable increases in the private sector funding. Under a coalition government, we would be seeking to encourage exactly that so that there could be capital expenditure which would proceed without diminishing the funds available to other elements of the sporting program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking also about reducing by $4m what was then classified as the $27m running costs of the Australian Sports Commission Institute of Sport either by improved cost recoveries or reducing the booming $10m salaries bill.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contrary to the Government's dishonest claim that very few sporting organisations will benefit from the taxes to be removed by the Opposition in the Fightback package, wiping out these seven taxes will considerably reduce the cost of running sporting organisations.

In other words, this Government collects $240m out of sport and gives back about one-third, a proportion which will be diminishing over the next three years under the Government's forward sports program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, under the coalition's plan, sales tax will be totally removed and any 15 per cent GST that replaces this 20 per cent sales tax will be fully refunded to any sporting club or deducted from whatever GST the clubs themselves may collect. So it will in fact be cheaper to run sporting clubs, but, in some instances, it may be dearer to belong to them. Let us get this exactly, honestly right. Sporting clubs, for example, buying advertising space will have whatever GST they pay fully refunded to them. If they sell advertising, media or catering rights or accept sponsorships there will be no net cost difference at all as the GST they charge will be totally refunded to the buyer or the sponsor. So sponsorships will not be adversely affected by the GST, but that is not what the Government tells people. The Government has simply been spreading falsehoods to try to terrorise sports people about the alleged disastrous impact of the Fightback package on sport when the facts are that the Fightback package reduces the costs of running sporting organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the cut of 26c a litre in fuel prices to sporting clubs and transport companies, along with the 19c a litre price cut to private motorists, will mean a major reduction in costs of attending competition for clubs, members and spectators. Any GST on accommodation or transport that is paid for by a sporting club will be totally refundable to that club, and the Government knows it. Government members knew that when they got up and said exactly the opposite in the other place. It is just a disgrace that there can be such deliberate distortion of what the facts really are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This 20 per cent sales tax that the Government imposes on sporting equipment is not only on clear sporting equipment such as hockey sticks and so on but also on paper, printing and so on involved in sporting programs. Soaps that sports people use after their games, detergents, antiseptics, Dencorub, sponges, buckets, toilet paper, writing and wrapping paper, mowers and tractors are all subject to 20 per cent sales tax under this Government. All of that sales tax will be removed and any GST that is imposed will be refundable to the sporting club. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess most sporting clubs do not realise that, at the moment, this Government collects a sales tax of 10 per cent on soft drink, fruit juices, ice cream and snack foods at their canteens. By the way, there is also a sales tax on sports trophies. But this Government does not admit that. It is going around saying that a new tax that has never existed before will hit all these items. That is simply and deliberately false, deceptive and dishonest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that all sporting clubs which have to meet any of these costs will have their GST refunded and any sales tax that exists now will be totally wiped out. They will be cheaper to run because these sales taxes will be removed. The costs of many things that do not appear to have a sales tax directly on them will be reduced because of the removal of those seven taxes. Even items that do not have a sales tax on them at the moment, such as sports uniforms, involve the payment of all those seven taxes, including payroll tax, in their production and transportation. For example, transport costs include a fuel excise at 26c a litre, a 20 per cent tax on spare parts and tyres and a tax on trucks, et cetera. All of that massive infrastructure of taxes is to be wiped out under the Fightback program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a shame that so many Australians do not realise the hidden level of tax this Government has imposed on them&mdash;and has inherited, I must say, as well&mdash;particularly in areas like sport and food, which have a massive impact on the cost of living. Those who say, `It is a bit of a worry that the Opposition has a GST as part of the Fightback campaign' appear to have forgotten that the Fightback campaign wipes out all of these massive taxes&mdash;for example, these 20 per cent taxes on sporting equipment and the 10 per cent taxes on soft drinks, fruit juices and so on at sporting canteens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, there will be some increases in the costs of participating in or watching sport. As I said, while it will be cheaper to run sporting organisations, memberships will carry a GST and being a spectator will involve paying a GST. However, if there are any net increases in that cost&mdash;remembering all the things that have offset the cost; the removal of all those other taxes&mdash;any such increased cost will be massively compensated by the 30 per cent cut in Australians' income taxes and the 8 per cent rise in pensions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole reason for introducing the GST is to get rid of those taxes and to reduce income tax so that people can make their own decisions about how to spend their money. So it is clear that sport will prosper under a Hewson government, particularly as the generation of two million extra jobs under the Hewson Fightback program will provide significantly increased opportunities for those Australians who are presently too hobbled by unemployment and the recession to participate in the sport of their choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people are saying, `This is terrible because it will be hard to handle it. How will sporting clubs' treasurers handle it?'. The fact is that it will take no greater administrative burden than already exists. A treasurer already has to keep records of how much money is spent and how much money is brought in. All that would happen is that, instead of once a year having to add up the total, he or she will have to do it every six months and will then be able to deduct whatever GST the club has paid from whatever GST it has received and send in the difference to the Australian Taxation Office. These sporting clubs or organisations will be able to keep in their hands for six months whatever tax they have collected to either reduce their overdraft or put on deposit to earn income for the benefit of the club. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sporting organisations with an annual turnover of less than $50,000&mdash;and most will probably be in this category&mdash;need not even register under the GST, collect GST or put GST on anything they do. Many such clubs may choose to be in the GST system in order to obtain the benefits of refunds on their purchases, such as on sports equipment and so on. Only clubs that have a turnover of between $50,000 and $250,000 will have to register with the Tax Office. They will then have to put in returns only once every six months. Clubs with higher turnovers, of up to $2m, need make returns only every three months. Any really big clubs, such as major football clubs, will put in monthly returns. They will also get the benefit of having the use of the surplus funds they get in GST before they have to pay it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">GST will have to be collected by a club on gate money and other receipts, including playing fees, membership and affiliation fees and merchandising, but not on donations or government grants. Many clubs survive very heavily on donations, government grants or sponsorships from the private sector. As I said, sponsorships will not be adversely affected whatsoever by the GST arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There seems to me to have been a deliberate and disgraceful campaign again the GST to try to terrorise sports people. I draw attention to those sports people who travel large distances to participate in their sport. Obviously the abolition of fuel excise, which adds 26c a litre to petrol prices, will be of major benefit to people who drive many kilometres, particularly those in the bush, to get in a game of cricket, football, netball or whatever sport it is that they play. Fuel for the average car will be about $11 a tankful cheaper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bus and charter companies will also be able to charge less because of their lower fuel costs and lower operating costs caused by the abolition of the other taxes, such as the removal of the sales tax on vehicles which seat less than 12 passengers, the removal of the tax of 20 per cent on parts and the end of payroll tax. Any GST that a sporting company has to pay a bus company will be totally refunded to that club. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now deal with the question of how much extra work sporting organisations would have to face. Research in New Zealand, which introduced a GST not so long ago, has indicated that there is little extra work for club treasurers as the return is a simple, one-page form. I mention by way of comparison that businesses in New Zealand with an annual turnover of around $2m have indicated in surveys that their returns each two months involve a maximum of 10 to 15 minutes extra work. That means that, for most clubs, all that will be needed is for the treasurer to maintain exactly the same sorts of records of revenue and expenditure as now but to add up the total once every six months rather than once every 12 months in order to establish the GST paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This campaign of dishonesty deserves to fail. It is an absolute nonsense. I restate that the coalition intends to maintain real funding to Australian sporting organisations through the Australian Sports Commission. We are committed to that under Fightback. By the way, we will make certain that there is much fairer allocation under that program than presently exists, whereby special elite sports funding is limited only to Olympic sports. That is unfair on many sports such as netball, for example, which are national sports. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most important thing that needs to be said about the GST relates to all those people for whom Senator Baume seemed to have a concern. Those people who are at the lower end of the income scale will spend a very large percentage of their income, if not all of it, on food, clothing and the sorts of services that he mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If people currently enjoy going to a game of football because that is their weekly entertainment, the Opposition will whack a 15 per cent goods and services tax on that. If they are at the lower end of the income scale that will make a difference to their very tight budget. The Opposition fails to say&mdash;this must be recognised by the community&mdash;that the Fightback package is massively and wickedly regressive. This means that people on low incomes who spend most of their money on the necessities of life&mdash;food and clothing and possibly some modest entertainment&mdash;will suffer a 15 per cent increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, people at the top end of the scale, who have a large amount of what is called disposable income&mdash;income that they do not have to spend on food and clothing&mdash;will enjoy increased amounts of that money because they will have their tax rates reduced and all the benefits of a goods and services tax, that is, income tax reductions, more disposable income and other savings to offset the increase of 15 per cent on food and clothing. But people at the other end of the scale on low and modest incomes, particularly people with fixed incomes, will spend most of their money on services and food and clothing and they will be considerably hurt by the GST. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the most important thing that I can say after listening to Senator Baume's contribution is that I hope none of the people who play sport get an injury. That would require a massive change because at the moment one of the big concerns I have relates to the number of people who are injured in sport and then have to use our health care services for treatment for those injuries. During a meeting I was at not too long ago evidence was put that the sporting injuries which are often defined as acute or emergency get to queue jump on people waiting for elective surgery, very often properly so because they are emergencies, but they are one of the reasons that contribute to the waiting lists that we have and which seem to be so often misrepresented by the Opposition. I want to come to them in a moment. Under the Opposition, if people get sick they can expect that what is a manageable system now will be replaced by an appalling one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, under the GST the Opposition intends to make everybody pay more to go and see the doctor. At the moment the majority of services&mdash;something like 70 per cent&mdash;are bulkbilled, which means that when a person goes to see the doctor there is no extra outlay. When people see a doctor they do not have the worry about whether or not they can afford that visit to the doctor; the same applies to their families, their children and elderly relatives. The doctor is bulkbilling. Something between 70 to 76 per cent of services are bulkbilled. There is no extra cost when a person goes to see the doctor. Under the Opposition that outlay will be $31, an increase to the AMA's schedule of fees from 20 per cent to 30 per cent on cost. Bulkbilling will be restricted only to pensioners and card holders provided the doctor bulkbills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole pressure that exists in the system at the moment to encourage doctors to bulkbill&mdash;we see that they have been encouraged and are bulkbilling in such a large part&mdash;will be removed and the visit to the doctor will be increased from 20 per cent to 30 per cent to the AMA's schedule of fees, up from just over $23 to $31. People will have to find that $31 per visit per person when they go to the doctor. That will be the first horrible shock if the Opposition should ever get in and implement its health system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, people will be encouraged to take out private insurance. Encouraged is a nice way of saying it; forced is a better way of saying it. If a family is on an income of $50,000 the Opposition will require that if they do not have private health insurance, they will pay the assessed value of the cost of that private health insurance of $800 a year on top of their Medicare levy, and that is for a family with an income of $50,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is hard for me to discover in reading the Fightback package whether, if people's incomes are above $50,000, they will pay even more than that. I understand that they will not. I understand that the cost of $800 for private health insurance, as estimated by the Opposition, will not rise for families with incomes above $50,000. So people on $50,000 will have to pay $800 extra, as will people with an income of $100,000. That is a regressive step. Eight hundred dollars will be paid out of $50,000 and the same $800 extra will be paid if one is on $100,000, $150,000 or $200,000. That is a point that the Opposition is not rushing around telling people, but they are the facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because the Opposition's Fightback package is called `Medicare is hopeless, Medicare does not work, Medicare shows that we are in crisis, our health system is failing all around the country', I ask the Opposition: why is it maintaining Medicare? If Medicare is so bad, why is the Opposition maintaining it? It is maintaining Medicare for three principal reasons. The first reason is that it wants the money. In its health package it is absolutely desperate that it keeps that money as it intends to remove something like $2 billion out of public expenditure on health. It would certainly like to make sure that it got the dollars that come to it from the Medicare levy. I would also like to know whether the Opposition will implement the Medicare levy at 1.25 per cent or whether it will move it up to 1.4 per cent. That is a matter about which it remains silent. It is certainly keeping Medicare because it wants the money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the Opposition knows it has to keep Medicare because it gives universal coverage. That means that every Australian is covered because of the Medicare principles. The Opposition does not dare remove them. It knows that if it removed them we would go back to how it was in the years of the Fraser Government with at least two million people without insurance. It is a situation like the American system. The Opposition knows it dare not go to the people with the prospect of two million people becoming uninsured. We know that is what would happen under its policies because of the cost it will put on people. It has kept Medicare for universal coverage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition members are a very sly lot. They keep Medicare, which they say is bad, because they want the money, they want universal coverage and they want the goodwill that goes with the name. They do not like to say that but it is true. Medicare is known, liked and dramatically appreciated by Australians around this country, and the Opposition would not dare to remove it. That is why it is keeping the name. It is keeping Medicare for the money, it is keeping Medicare for the insurance it will have with everybody covered universally and it is keeping it because it wants the goodwill from the name. It is very difficult for the Opposition to say out of one side of its mouth that Medicare is in crisis and out of the other side of its mouth that it will keep it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition does not like to tell people that under its health policy they will have to pay more to see the doctor. It will be a dramatic increase&mdash;up to $31 every time they go to see the doctor. What is more, those opposite will introduce the terrible co-payment. They will say to people, `You will not get insurance for more than 85 per cent of the cost of going to see your doctor'. Under the Fightback package, the arrangements will return to people 75 per cent of the fee from Medicare and allow them to buy private insurance against the gap from 75 to 85 per cent. But then they will pay from 85 per cent to 100 per cent themselves any time, every time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is about $5. Sometimes it may be a bit more than that, but Dr Bob Woods, who is the Opposition spokesperson on health, has settled on $5 so I will not dispute it. It is at least $5 which people will be left to pay after they get their bill for $31, after they claim from Medicare to get back their 75 per cent, and after they go to their private insurance company for the gap between 75 and 85 per cent. If they are still hanging in there, trying to recover from the paperwork, they will still have a bill of $5 per head, per time. One would not want to take two or three kids to the doctor at any one time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this system, we will have a return to the awful old days when people made decisions about going to the doctor not in terms of their need for health care but in terms of whether they could afford it. It is an outrage when we have a system in place which is of such benefit to people in general practice that it should be replaced in the way in which the Opposition is proposing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why are those opposite proposing to do this? I can assure honourable senators that the Government is not proposing it. They are proposing to do it because, in this case, they are beholden to the AMA. They are also linked very closely to implementing the agenda of the private insurance industry. This means that they have sold out the Australian people in favour of the vested interests they want to support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now turn to private insurance. The Opposition says that if one's family income is about $30,000, one will neither benefit nor be disadvantaged. Of course, that really means that people will have to pay for their health insurance themselves, but they will not get any rebate. If one's income is below $30,000, one will get a rebate on a sliding scale under the Opposition's policy. If the family income is $20,000 the Opposition will give a rebate of $200, but people will have to find the other $600 themselves.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one happens to be over 65 years of age and one's family income is below $12,500, the Government will pay the whole $800 itself. The Opposition is planning to rebate people $800, but we now hear Dr Woods saying that the Opposition will probably pay that $800 directly to the private insurance companies on people's behalf. What kind of system is that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most people do not realise that with private insurance all they will be getting is a licence for the specialists to charge like wounded bulls. Private insurance is no longer an assurance against medical bills; in fact, it is exactly the opposite. One of the principal reasons why people are leaving private insurance at the moment is that it does not provide that assurance or that comfort, but it does provide the likelihood of a very large bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any number of people have written or spoken to me about their own story. They tell me, `I have been buying private insurance for the last 25 years, 30 years or whatever. I want to make my contribution and I know that if I ever get sick I would like to be able to say that I have private insurance to back up my bills'. What has happened is that these people have had to use it. When they have gone into hospital and had an operation under their private insurance, they have found themselves saying, `What am I going to do, Senator, I've got a bill for $3,000 over and above what my insurance paid?  I'm on a fixed income; how on earth am I going to find it?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not a one-off case. Many people, when they finally go to use their private insurance, are shocked to find that they have a big bill. Under the Opposition we can be sure that the bill will be bigger, because the Opposition is moving to the AMA schedule of fees not only for general practice but also across the board. For specialists, that means a 25 to 30 per cent increase in costs. Those opposite say that the insurance will cost $800 per person. That has to be laughable because, at the moment, if people are lucky that would buy basic table cover, which will get them a private bed in a public hospital and nothing else. That is what the Opposition is offering&mdash;an $800 outlay and the prospect of a very significant increase in bills as the Opposition moves to the AMA schedule of fees, directly underwriting the specialists with an increase in costs. People will pay more, they will be hurting more and they will be charged more. Where is the money going? It is going straight through to the specialists and the private insurance industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our Budget this year we will move $1.3 billion&mdash;I welcome Senator Herron; I thought he might join us&mdash;to the public hospital system over six years. The Opposition has a policy which says it will remove that and more from the public hospital system by underwriting private insurance and encouraging people to take the opportunity to go private and cop the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that those opposite are not telling us is that the impact of the increased charges under the AMA schedule of fees will be directly inflationary. The cost of going to the doctor will get into the basket of goods which contributes to the CPI. Those opposite will raise inflation with a deliberate health policy which will increase the cost of going to the doctor and increase the cost of private insurance. Those opposite are claiming that it may reduce the cost of private insurance, but many more people will be forced to take it out. Bracketing those two things together, this means that the cost of private insurance will rise and it will be directly inflationary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the Opposition's own modest estimates put the inflationary effect at 0.7 per cent. That is a very modest assessment of the inflationary effect of its health policies. It will no doubt be more. What is more, it is only able to be introduced under cover of the GST. It is a very sneaky policy. Those opposite do not want to tell people that while they say we should maintain low inflation they are directly putting it up. They do not want to tell people that. They are saying that the inflationary effect of the GST will wash out very quickly, but the health contribution will stay and stay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what the Opposition would do if it were in government&mdash;it would whack up the cost to the individual, whack up the cost of private insurance, benefit the specialist doctors, and make a wonderful inflationary contribution which would maintain forever and make everything more expensive again. As well as the 15 per cent GST, those opposite would add their own little inflationary contribution. This move is particularly regressive and unfair for those people on low and fixed incomes. Those opposite are a sneaky lot&mdash;particularly with regard to their health costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important things to remember about the Opposition's health policy are the hidden extra costs in it. This is not obvious when one reads through <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> and sees the headlines which make it look as though everything will be much better. As I said at the beginning of my contribution when I followed Senator Michael Baume, we would have to cop the GST on food and on the clothing we would use if we were to take up a sport. But should we be interested in things such as preventive health and promoting health through a better diet, mineral intakes, vitamin intakes, sport and exercise, and self-treatments of that sort, then the GST would be added to all of those things too. Many of the things which are classed as `lifestyle matters' or are part of the contribution to preventive health would have a GST applied to them as well. This lot opposite is pretty good: every time you stick your head up, whack, they will increase the costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having made one sick, the Opposition will then make it impossible for anyone to cope when they have to get into the health system. The Opposition is a tough lot. It has all these clever stories about how 10 per cent will come off, but 15 per cent will be going on. By anybody's equation, that is an increase in costs. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am enormously assisted by the Chair. The other point that needs to be spelt out is that currently, under the Medicare arrangement with this Government, Australia spends 8 per cent of its total income, its GDP, on health. That level has been maintained over the years we have been in government, and it compares very well with other countries. In the United States, which is the way the Opposition wants us to go, 12 per cent of GDP is spent on health. That is estimated to rise to 15 or 16 per cent by the year 2000. Indeed, if the United States continues the way it is going now, it will be spending 25 per cent of GDP by the year 2030. I suspect that it is not without relevance that Mr Clinton is doing so well in the US presidential race, because one of the things that he is arguing for is a dramatic change in health care and the way it is funded and insured against. The Americans know that they cannot continue that way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in this country we have an Opposition which says, `We will go back and go that way'. The Opposition wants to remove bulkbilling, the constraints of Medicare and bulkbilling that are now in the system, which we see are working at restraining costs and which are so acceptable to the community. If we take the figures, we can see that the medical profession is also accommodating what is required under Medicare. We can see that it is very much liked. Any poll will show that the Australian community is clear in liking Medicare; they want Medicare and they can see no reason for it to change. It is simple and fair, cuts down the cost of going to the doctor or the hospital, and it provides health care for all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I want to deal with some of the better fibs told by the Opposition about waiting lists. In this Budget the Government has allocated the expenditure of $70m over the next two years to deal directly with reducing waiting lists. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have done it before. Senator Kemp is either ignorant or does not know his history; otherwise he is deliberately not knowing his history. The Government, in an arrangement with the States, allocated once before a specific extra funding to reduce waiting lists and it worked.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts about waiting lists are very hard to assess. We do not have accurate or reliable data. However, we have Peter Shack saying in 1990 that 100,000 people were on waiting lists around the country and the Fightback package last year saying that it was 60,000. That could be because the Labor Government had reduced it by 40,000 in two years, but it is more likely to be that it is just a best guess. The Opposition bid it way up because that is the message that it wants to tell people and the Government is trying to bid it fair. It is trying to obtain the data on waiting lists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Waiting lists are State matters. It is very difficult to get the States to pass that information over to the Commonwealth. That is one of the things that would be up for negotiation in the current round of Commonwealth-State agreements for Medicare. We cannot go on not having access to that data. If the States want a fair allocation of funding to deal with the health care that they are providing for their citizens&mdash;and this Government strongly supports that&mdash;then it is also important that the States provide sufficient, accurate, reliable and timely data to enable the Government to assist the States. It is not a matter of being at war; it is a matter of trying to assess, with the help of the data, the best way of providing funding to the States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition runs on fear and smear. It is always its tactic&mdash;it has done it with waiting lists&mdash;because it trades on human misery. It is a disgusting campaign. The stories put around by the Opposition about waiting lists are of no assistance to government or to the people in the community who are dealing with the difficulties that they have to confront. The Opposition has the view that there would be no such thing as waiting lists if it ever got into office because everyone would be forced to take out private health insurance and would retreat to the private hospitals. We know that they will not. I say that for many reasons, particularly clinical reasons&mdash;that is, the nature of the illness. People will continue to attend public hospitals because that is where the state-of-the-art health care is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is of remarkable relevance to ask where Kerry Packer went after he suffered his heart attack. I do not think he was in too much of a position to say at the time where he went. He went into the public hospital system. He was treated and assisted to recover. After he had made his recovery, he went on to convalesce in the private hospital system. People who suffer heart attacks and have heart problems will continue to go to public hospitals from whatever part of Australia they come and whatever their insurance status. That is where those conditions are best and most often treated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One does not go to a private hospital to receive acute care for cardiac problems. We do not go to a private hospital for major brain surgery. We do not go to a private hospital for intensive care. One will not under the Opposition's health policy. We will continue, as clinical condition dictates and as the medical profession sees best, to send people into the public hospital system. People will also choose to go into the public hospital system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What people are facing, coming up to the next election when they consider their health prospects, is the simple, fair, accessible universal system we have at the moment called Medicare which they understand, which they like and which they want to see continue. The alternative is the gobbledegook and mess that the Opposition intends to put in its place. The Opposition will increase individual costs of visits to the doctor, force private health insurance on to people, increase dramatically the cost of treatment in hospitals, increase inflation and blow out the GDP percentage of expenditure allocated to health. It is a very easy debate to take to the public. I am certainly going to do it, as I have been again and again. The Opposition wants people to pay more; we want them to have Medicare, which is fair and universal. There is no way that the health policy of the Opposition can win votes. </PARA>

The few honourable senators who are in this chamber and heard the remarks of Senator Crowley&mdash;there may be more who have tuned in to listen&mdash;may be interested to be reminded that Senator Crowley used the phrase `fear and smear' about the coalition's policy. I suggest that for half an hour we have had what can only be termed as fear and smear.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People who are listening tonight will be interested to know that this is an example&mdash;although not a particularly good example&mdash;of the sort of scare campaign which the Australian Labor Party will run between now and the next election. Senator Crowley has had her marching orders. Mr Keating has told her, `What we have to do is scare the hell out of people. You go into that Parliament and say anything at all which will cause fear amongst ordinary Australian citizens'. Senator Crowley does not do this all that well, but she came in here and ran the Labor line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will just put a few facts on the record for people who may have felt concerned about some of the remarks that Senator Crowley made. I urge people who have further concerns to speak to my colleague Senator Herron who will be speaking in this debate probably tomorrow or the next week that Parliament sits. They will be interested to learn in detail just how wrong Senator Crowley was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The health system of this country is strained for lack of funds. One only has to ask any health Minister, Labor or Liberal, around the States. That is the reason why we have mounting hospital queues. Senator Crowley conceded in her remarks that she did not have a clue what the hospital queues are. Why would Senator Crowley know what the waiting times are for people to get treatment in hospitals, because the Labor Government simply does not want to find out these facts. The facts are very damaging to the Labor Government. They affect many people in its own constituency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that there are many Labor people out there who are waiting for treatment in hospitals, who are surprised that Senator Crowley did not seem to know, or evince any interest in finding out, what are the elementary facts: what are the waiting lists in hospitals&mdash;all of us know that they are very substantial; and what can be done about them. Senator Crowley made no commitments to cut back the growing waiting lists which we are seeing in hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Medicare levy itself, as we know, only supplies a minor part of the funds which are needed for health care in this country. The vast bulk, of course, comes from taxation&mdash;Consolidated Revenue. The Government's answer to the health crisis is what economists term rationing. Rationing essentially means that if you will not provide enough services, the queues form, and that is precisely what we are now seeing in the hospital system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have set out in great detail an excellent health policy in the Fightback program which will take the pressure off the public health system by subsidising, and this is the point that the Labor Party really detests. Under the John Hewson plan we will be subsidising lower income earners to take out private health insurance. These are the very people, often members of the Labor constituency, who are at the end of the queue. The only freedom they have at the moment is to join the queue. If the particular treatment they require is not acute, they have the freedom now to join the queue. This is another of these lengthening queues which has expanded under the Labor Government. We have the expanding health queues and the expanding dole queues. As I said, Senator Herron will be explaining in detail the excellent health policy that the Liberal and National parties have put together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Often, when I go around and speak to people and they raise the scare tactics that Senator Crowley has raised today&mdash;and Senator McMullan occasionally gets up here and fulfils his marching orders and tries to raise a few shock horrors&mdash;I find the most effective thing to say when they repeat what Labor people have been saying to me is, `Why would you believe anything that Mr Keating says?'. Why would they? The man has an incredible, I suspect absolutely unparalleled, record of breaking his commitments to the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating, we know, believes in the shock horror politics, the politics of the big scare, the politics of the big lie. We probably have not had a Prime Minister like that in this country, certainly not in my own memory. These Appropriation Bills before us clearly outline an important part of the election strategy of the Labor Government which Mr Keating has laid down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On reflecting on the debates in this Parliament today and previously, it is clear that Mr Keating has managed to convince at least enough of the Labor Party to overthrow their elected leader, Mr Hawke, and put him in office in the hope that somehow he can, shall I say, save the Labor bacon. In recent months we have seen a somewhat unique man in terms of what we have seen in Australian politics before. Many Prime Ministers have led this country, but Mr Keating in many ways has unique characteristics which I happen to believe make him somewhat ill-suited to lead this country&mdash;certainly to lead this country in a time of great crisis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have set down seven features of Mr Keating which I believe the public will want to focus on as we go to the next election. Firstly, he is, arguably, probably the richest Prime Minister in Australian history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Government senators interjecting</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Labor Party gets embarrassed by that. There is nothing wrong with being rich, but it is a bit difficult to play the class war line if you are a multi-millionaire like Mr Keating. He is arguably the richest Prime Minister in Australian history. Secondly, he is the only Prime Minister in our history who is not proud to fly our flag. John Curtin certainly was very proud to fly our flag, as was the greatly esteemed Ben Chifley. These men were not embarrassed about flying our flag and Dr Evatt, of course, is on the record as describing our flag as the most beautiful flag in the world. There are not many things that I agree with Dr Evatt on, but I think he was absolutely spot on on that issue. As I said, one of the characteristics of Mr Keating is that he is the only Prime Minister who is not proud of our flag and will not fly it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly&mdash;and I think this cannot be argued against&mdash;he is the only Prime Minister who has ever attacked our national institutions while overseas. You, Mr Acting Deputy President, would undoubtedly have felt the horror that many Australians felt about the trip to Jakarta where Mr Keating felt it was appropriate to bag our Constitution in a foreign country. I think that marks him off as having another unique characteristic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, I believe that Mr Keating holds the record for demeaning Parliament and lowering parliamentary standards. Many tens of thousands of people watch our Question Time, and Question Time in the House of Representatives, and can see day after day the accuracy of that statement. The fifth characteristic that I believe makes Mr Keating somewhat unique is that he has probably chalked up a record second to none in terms of broken promises and policy failures. This will be an issue that I will be expanding on later in my remarks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sixth characteristic of Mr Keating is that he is, I suspect&mdash;and there will be debates on this&mdash;the most cynical of Prime Ministers. He will do anything, say anything and attack any institution to advance his own narrow interests and those of the Labor Party. The seventh characteristic that I think is worth bringing to the attention of the public is that he has certainly led the country to its worst recession since the 1930s. I put all of those characteristics down on the record. There may be other ones which people might like to highlight, but it is interesting that this Prime Minister has marked himself out as a unique Prime Minister in a number of ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to Senator Crowley's remarks, I raise the issue: who would believe Mr Keating after what he has said? I remind people that in the period before the last election quite a number of issues were debated. I think the most memorable was the promise by Mr Keating&mdash;made almost on a daily basis&mdash;that there would not be a recession in this country. All of us can recall that Mr Keating, being constantly pressed on this matter, assured the Australian public time and time again that there would not be a recession. Of course, as we know, not only did we have a recession but we had the worst recession in 60 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Parliament resumed after the March election in 1990, Mr Keating continued to pretend that there was no recession in this country, despite the mounting evidence and the concerns of people in big business and small business alike. Mr Acting Deputy President, you may remember the headlines on 29 November when the Prime Minister was finally embarrassed into admitting what everybody else knew and what Senator Button knew and had already made comments on: that the accounts did show that Australia was in recession. He then went on to say a phrase which has certainly gone down in Australian history and which continues to vex members on the Labor side because it shows a harshness and a cynicism which I do not think we have seen in Australian politics. Mr Keating not only admitted that we were in a recession&mdash;and that was certainly an important concession&mdash;he then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most important thing about it is, this is the recession that Australia had to have.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the man who was not going to let there be a recession, the man who denied that there was a recession, conceded in November 1990 that this was the recession we had to have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suspect that people in the community have long asked: if that was the case, why did Mr Keating not level with us at that time? As recently as last week, our Prime Minister was up to his old tricks; his old habits of overstatement and saying anything at any time if he perceives some political advantage. Last week in the Parliament, Mr Keating, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We were out of the recession long ago.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Acting Deputy President, I do not know whether you read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, but you will find on either page 2 or 3 of that paper this morning that Mr Keating conceded in Caucus that that remark had damaged not only his own standing&mdash;which I find a bit hard to believe because I would not have thought his own standing could be damaged further&mdash;but also that of the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to remember that as we go to the next election we are going to get these complaints and these scare tactics from the Labor Party, and that we are getting them from a man who simply has shown that he will say anything, do anything and break any promise, provided that he can perceive some narrow political advantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue that came forth in that election which I wish to raise in this chamber is the great concern in the election campaign about whether Mr Hawke was going to stay on as Prime Minister. Undoubtedly during that election period, Senator McMullan and Senator West were asked by constituents whether Mr Hawke was going to run his full term. It was a very big issue and I suspect that you, Mr Acting Deputy President, can recall that issue being raised. How often did Mr Hawke say that, yes, he was going to serve his full term? It came out many months later that, in November of the previous year, an agreement had been reached between Mr Hawke and Mr Keating, witnessed by the two other leaders of the corporate state in Australia, Mr Bill Kelty and Sir Peter Abeles, that during the term of the next Hawke Government, if it was elected, there would be a transfer of power to Mr Keating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While this grubby deal was transacted, with witnesses Bill Kelty and Sir Peter Abeles, Mr Hawke had no compunction about saying that he would be serving his full term&mdash;and neither did Mr Keating, because he was being pressed by the newspapers to say whether it was true that a deal had been done with Mr Hawke to transfer the Prime Ministership to him if Labor was re-elected to office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know whether we could use the term `the much loved Senator Button' on the Labor side of politics because Senator Button does seem to have a habit of raising interesting issues, sometimes in relation to Labor policy&mdash;rather like blowing the whistle. On 6 February, Senator Button said in an interview in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What I think I said was that Hawke and Keating ought to reach some agreement about this; that Keating had been around for a long time and that I would have hoped Hawke and Keating would have reached some agreement about it. I suspect, incidentally, that they have.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what Senator Button said on 6 February. Having raised the issue he then said, `I don't know'. This was a fundamental issue. We were in an election period and the issue before the Australian people was: `If we vote Labor, are we electing Hawke or are we really electing Mr Keating?'. It was a very big issue and it was raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating, our current Prime Minister, told the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun News-Pictorial</EMPHASIS> on 7 February 1990 that he had not made a deal with Mr Hawke on the leadership.

It was in the famous National Press Club speech on 7 February 1991 that Mr Keating likened himself to Placido Domingo and implied to the press that Mr Hawke was not a great leader. Some months later he confessed that a deal had been struck which Mr Hawke had dishonoured.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to honourable senators that these were the two major issues for the people at the last election: would there be a recession; and did the Labor Party have the policies to pull the country out of recession if it got into it, or did it have the policies to avoid the recession? Mr Keating promised day after day that there would be no recession. In other words, he was trying to build up confidence again and retain confidence in the Government. That has a striking similarity to the current situation. The other issue was whether the public was electing Mr Hawke or Mr Keating to be Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, Mr Keating misled the Australian public on those two critical issues.

I suggest to members of the Australian public that when they hear their Labor members of parliament and their Labor senators going around trying to scare them, remember that they are working from the marching orders of Mr Keating, a man who has a completely unenviable record in misleading the Australian public.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that the incredible range of policy flips and policy changes which have occurred since Mr Keating assumed the office of Prime Minister have been absolutely amazing. We have had the One Nation statement which, within a matter of months, certainly seemed to have failed; it was conceded widely by people on the Labor side of the Parliament to have failed. That is why some further radical changes were brought down in Mr Keating's latest Budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask Senator McMullan whether he can remember the amazing way in which policy was being developed by this Government. I wonder whether he can recall, as I recall, the really quite famous interview on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program with Laurie Oakes in May. This was Mr Keating grabbing the initiative. He announced that there would be major changes in relation to the privatisation of Qantas. The first of the many pay TV policies was announced. There was going to be this great national scheme with TAFE. The Labor Caucus was excited by this stunning performance of Mr Keating, who was able to appear on Laurie Oakes's show and announce three major policy initiatives in one hit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting when we look back at all this to see how many of those great policy initiatives have remained. The States certainly gave Mr Keating his marching orders on the so-called national TAFE scheme&mdash;that collapsed. It was a headline which probably lasted for a day or so. Then there was the issue of pay TV. We have had the fourth change of policy since then, or the fifth&mdash;I do not know. Senator McMullan may enlighten us in his remarks. Probably, by the time Senator McMullan sums up this debate, we will have had a few more policy changes. This interview was Mr Keating's stunning performance in bringing down these new policies. Of course, there is now considerable doubt whether the privatisation plans for Qantas will succeed. There are serious problems in relation to that policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have a classic case of policy on the run, policy poorly conceived, policy poorly thought through, policy designed merely to grab the headlines and to re-grab the initiative. As always with Mr Keating, there is policy failure. Has our Prime Minister learned, Mr Acting Deputy President? The answer must surely be no. I remind you of Mr Keating's recent trip to Japan. I guess, like many Australians, we really would prefer Mr Keating and his Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Evans, to stay at home, because every time they go overseas there seems to be a further series of crises and problems. </PARA>

We have recently had a book written on the late Sir Robert Menzies&mdash;arguably one of Australia's great political leaders. He was a man who, above all, I suggest, had great standards of propriety; he was certainly a man who concentrated all his attention on trying to run this country rather than trying to run a pig farm; and he was a man who had little interest in making money but had a great love and passion for our country. I would suggest that there is a great contrast between the current actions and values embodied by Mr Keating and those of Sir Robert Menzies. </PARA>

They are the four economic temporal virtues which are simply these: less tax, less government, more wealth, and more opportunity for ordinary working Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this Government we have an enormous taxation burden: an enormous burden of personal taxation; an enormous burden of indirect taxation. We have payroll tax at 5 or 6 per cent which is putting Australian workers out of jobs in droves. Lest anybody think that 5 per cent payroll tax is a small imposition on an employer, just consider this: in Rockhampton, where we have two major meatworks, each of which employs about 400 people, the payroll in each of those meatworks is something in excess of $12m; the 5 per cent payroll tax applicable in Queensland means that each of those meatworks pays, in government taxation for employing meat workers, over $600,000 a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the desperate situation of the meat industry in Australia, at abattoirs that have closed down from one end of Australia to the other, at meat workers who have been thrown on the unemployment queue by this Government's taxation policies and by this Government's industrial relations policies, we are forced to ask ourselves: how many more abattoirs would have stayed open if they could have had $600,000 more profit every year? But they will not get it under Labor; they will not get it under Paul Keating; they will not get it under this Government because this Government believes in more rather than less taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a time when we need less government, what do we get but a burgeoning public sector. The reason why we get a burgeoning public sector is that that is the only way that this Government can engineer any sort of growth at all in the economy. We on this side of the chamber say that not only should there be less taxation, but also less government, meaning less debt and many more opportunities for people out there in the private sector to generate real wealth. And more wealth is the third of the economic temporal virtues which we on this side of the chamber espouse today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There should be more wealth, and not just for the wealthy, as has happened under Paul Keating and Bob Hawke&mdash;because under that pair of Prime Ministers we have seen a growing gap between rich and poor&mdash;but more wealth for all Australians through a policy that will reward those people who wish to make an effort. There will be more wealth for people who wish to work longer or harder or smarter. That is how this nation was built&mdash;on hard work, endeavour and achievement. They are the very qualities and characteristics that this Government, through its taxation policy, is destroying in this nation today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the fourth economic temporal virtue&mdash;and it flows from the other three&mdash;is more opportunity, by reforming the industrial relations system, for example. If somebody wants to choose to work outside the award or work different hours and start at 8 o'clock instead of 9 o'clock and finish at 4 o'clock instead of 5 o'clock, that person and his or her employer should not be penalised for doing so.

However, information provided by one of his Ministers, Senator Cook, to an Estimates committee hearing the day after, 17 September, stated that Mr Crean, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, said he was pleased with the progress evident in pork joint ventures. This statement is in a ministerial recall note of a meeting held between Mr Crean and the Danish Minister for Agriculture, Mr Tornaes, on 8 April 1992. </PARA>

But does it hold good when a series of Australian governments have unfairly prejudiced a person's opportunity of meeting the requirement?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a number of years the ability of Mrs Burchett to come to Australia was frustrated by successive Federal governments. This had to do with the view they formed of her husband, Wilfred Burchett. They saw him as a figure of evil given to the Communist cause in times of awesome tension between East and West. Because of this, they refused him a passport and effectively kept him in exile for many years. They made sure that his wife and children did not become Australian citizens and were kept abroad. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most learned of people have debated the issue of whether Wilfred Burchett did great good or great evil or both during his lifetime. The relevant knowledge I have is limited and in this speech I do not address it. Rather, I will talk of the injustice governments did to the man and his family by effectively keeping him offshore for over a decade and a half without telling him in specific terms what they held against him and denying him an opportunity to put his case to a court, or even to an administrative authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just government requires that people accused of wrongdoing not be punished until after a fair hearing.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In speaking of the want of proper process in the way Federal governments dealt with Wilfred Burchett, I do not imply that the substance of his case lacked merit. He maintained throughout his life that his actions were honourable and in keeping with his obligations as an Australian. No court has ever held to the contrary. According to our common law tradition, he is entitled to his good name. Exile is a fearful penalty, whether applied with or without a hearing. </PARA>

The interjections that we have been receiving in Question Time in relation to these matters are clearly designed to put Senator Boswell and others off, but I can tell you, Mr Deputy President, that we are not going to be put off. We are going to get to the bottom of this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first mystery I observe is the letter from Mr Landos, the director of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service dated 3 June 1992. In that letter he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Danes first raised the possibility of access for live pigs in the mid 1980s. This request was not formally followed-up until 1990 when it re-emerged as an issue at Prime Ministerial level in the context of proposals for a joint venture between Danish and Australian pig breeding and processing interests.</PARA>
<PARA>We know that Mr Landos said he was mistaken in including those words because, in a letter of 21 July, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I must correct an error in my previous advice to you at Page 2, Paragraph 4 of my 3 June 1992 letter regarding the status of proposals for importation of live pigs from Denmark. This letter incorrectly advised that the issue of possible live pigs from Denmark re-emerged at Prime Ministerial level in April 1990.</PARA>
<PARA>He was asked about this error on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Country Hour</EMPHASIS> on 15 September 1992. He was asked why he had retracted what he stated in the first letter. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because it was wrong. The original letter was a slip up. The words in that letter were wrong and it should have made it quite clear that there was no involvement by either the Prime Minister or any Ministers.</PARA>
<PARA>He was pressed a little with the question: `But that's a very serious mistake' and his answer was, `Yes, it was one of those slips'. But as I observed the Estimates committee before which Mr Landos appeared, it seemed that the first letter was actually the product of a drafting committee, you might say, of three officials and that the words were specifically included. They were not in the earlier drafts; they were specifically added by Mr Landos, who was the senior member of that drafting group. Yet now he says that it was a mistake. I cannot understand why one would specifically add those words to the draft by a slip. It just does not make sense to me. If that were just a one-off, perhaps one would forget it, but it does not seem to be just a one-off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have come to this matter obviously later than Senator Boswell. I have come to it really out of the fact that it was clear that Senator Boswell was not getting proper answers in this place from Senator Button. I raised with Senator Button the fact that twice he had denied that the issue of importing pig semen had been raised at ministerial level when there was another memo from the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service dated 23 June 1992, again signed by the same Mr Landos, which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Danish Minister for Agriculture raised the matter of access for uncooked Danish pigmeat and pig semen during discussions with Mr Crean in April 1992.</PARA>
<PARA>As I said, twice Senator Button had said that that did not occur. On the face of it, that obviously requires an answer because what he has put to us was inconsistent with what was on the face of this memorandum. Finally today, in answer to a supplementary, if I interpret him correctly, what Senator Button said was, `I have not been misleading you because the memo is wrong'. So it seems that today, the Minister is saying that this memorandum of Mr Landos, which specifically says that these issues of the import of pig semen were raised with Mr Crean, is wrong. I wonder whether that is the view of Mr Landos as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter is complicated even further by the involvement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). It seems that the Prime Minister applied the heavy to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> newspaper back on 16 September 1992. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, apparently in early editions the previous day, had reported that a family company of the Prime Minister was an investor in Danpork Australia, which planned to import live pigs from Denmark as part of a joint venture operation with a Danish company. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> in its correction said that that was wrong. The correction stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The joint venture in which Mr Keating has an interest will use local stock. It has no intention of importing any pigs or breeding material from anywhere, and has not applied to do so. The mistake was made by a reporter.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Keating says the joint venture has not been the subject of any ministerial talks, nor has it been involved in contact with the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet, the same memorandum that I referred to a moment ago of Mr Landos, dated 23 June 1992, says elsewhere:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A joint venture between Danpork (Denmark) and the Australian company Brown and Hatton has recently been announced to establish an integrated industry in Australia based on Danish processing technology, Australian pig genetics and, ultimately, with inclusion of Danish pig genetic material if possible.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to press the matter further tonight because it seems to me that there are many unanswered questions that are going to require answers before one can come to final conclusions on this matter. But, as I said at the outset, we are not going to let the matter rest at this stage. We are going to continue to press for the answers to those questions until we find out what the true picture is and whatever consequences might flow from that will so flow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I regret in some ways that it has been necessary to raise that issue, because I really wanted to deal with the question of Somalia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commitment of Australian forces to Somalia was a very major decision of the Australian Government.  We also said that in relation to the commitment of Australian forces to Cambodia. However, in some ways, the environment in Somalia is even more dangerous. That does not mean that the decision to commit forces should not be made. In fact, the Opposition today said that we support the decision of the Government. In other words, we support the international community in trying to help the Somali people in the resolution of their awful situation. As such, we have certain specialist skills which have been called upon by the United Nations. As a responsible member of the international community, we endorse the Government's decision to accept that invitation from the UN to enable our skills to be used in this way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As in the case of Cambodia, we said that in a situation where such a serious decision is made, the Australian Parliament and the Australian people really deserve a full statement of the background situation; the conflict that is occurring; the role that the United Nations is seeking to play in helping the local people overcome their conflict; the particular function that the Australian personnel will play within the UN force; and the risk assessment into which they are being placed, and matters of that nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without wanting to be unduly critical of the Minister's using Question Time and a brief answer to announce that, I really think that today the Government should have put down such a statement.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister ultimately has to accept responsibility for these grave decisions. I would like to see him come back to this Parliament, if not tomorrow at least at the beginning of the next sitting fortnight, and put down a detailed statement in the terms I have just outlined. That is the very least that the Australian Parliament is entitled to have. It is entitled to have the opportunity to properly debate the decision of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My only visit to Somalia was also at a sad time&mdash;a time of conflict between states, in that instance between Somalia and Ethiopia. I visited the Ogaden area where fighting was occurring and saw very similar circumstances to the tragedy that we are now seeing except that this tragedy of the starvation and the pain and suffering is not arising out of a conflict between states but a conflict within a state. However, the consequences for those who suffer are exactly the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the United Nations to look to assume a role in that environment is really to accept a very challenging mission. I can recall no instance where the UN has sought such a role in a circumstance where there has been a total breakdown of authority with no governmental function. It raises all sorts of interesting questions as to what might be the role of the UN in the internal affairs of states in circumstances of the breakdown of authority in the future. To some extent it therefore sets a precedent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the whole international community is so appalled at what is occurring in Somalia that there is this desperate feeling that we as a community as a whole cannot let it continue without taking some action in an attempt to alleviate the suffering. Thus the UN, in an unprecedented act on 28 August 1992, unanimously passed resolution 775 authorising the increase in strength of the United Nations operation in Somalia known as UNOSOM. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was to increase the total force from the original few observers that had been sent to Mogadishu to a force of 3,500, which comprised four battalions of 750 each that were provided by Canada, Austria, Egypt and Belgium. They were to be deployed at Bossasso in the north-east, and in the south-west near the Kenyan border. Two other places that the Secretary-General wished to deploy such forces were Berbera and Kismayu in the south-east. However, we understand that Mohamed Sahsoun, the UN special envoy to Somalia, is still waiting for the local war lords to agree to their deployment in those two places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was privileged to have been briefed on this matter at the United Nations in New York the week before last, not only for humanitarian reasons but because I had heard rumours that Australia was going to be asked to contribute to these movement control forces to the Somali mission. I raised with UN authorities this notion that the UN has to seek the authority of local war lords before it can assume its task. Regrettably, the answer was simply that the law and order position is so desperate in Somalia that the UN would not be able to carry out its function without the authority and support of local war lords&mdash;something that one must find appalling. Nevertheless, the mandate, which we endorse, was for the protection of the convoys that transport the supplies from the port or the airport to warehouses and distribution centres, the protection of those stores and centres and the protection of the distribution process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many brave aid officials, both from the United Nations and NGOs, have been and now are in Somalia seeking to benefit those who are suffering. At the very least it seems that the UN, our international body that is utilising the strength of the international community, should be prepared to offer them some support to protect the food chain that is going to those who are starving as a result of the conflict. I use this opportunity to register my credit to those brave individuals who are at the moment in a very dangerous environment. We read in the Australian press this morning about certain officials from the CARE organisation. We should admire their work and give them due credit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that there is a totally unstable situation on the ground. As I indicated, there is no semblance of normal law and order. On the one hand, there is clan rivalry, with each clan supporting these distinctive war lords, and on the other there is a wider situation of law and order breakdown, usually with the result of young thugs taking the law into their own hands and extorting people, including, sadly, these aid workers. It will not be an easy task to bring that situation to some form of order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised that more than 10,000 people have already died from the combined effects of war and drought and another two million are threatened, which gives us some idea of the extent of the tragedy. What has been left in the country of the health infrastructure is at best rudimentary. According to the UN Secretary-General, as many as 4.5 million people are in desperate need of food and other assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past six weeks the UN world food program has been able to airlift some 210 tonnes of supplies to this environment each day. But for that supply of food, the figures for deaths that I mentioned would be even much greater. However, they are suffering from a shortage of trucks and spare parts, poor roads, high security costs and the widespread looting of which we have heard a great deal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the political end, the UN is struggling. It is under the mandate of the Secretary-General in the resolution I mentioned, with some support from the OAU and the League of Arab States, to try to bring these war lords together to see whether some form of comprehensive political solution might be found. Until such a solution is found, sadly, all that we and the UN will be doing is providing a bandaid. Nevertheless, a bandaid is of benefit to those who are suffering, rather than nothing at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make that brief contribution tonight, putting before the Senate some detail of the environment in which our forces will be placed. I regret that it has not been put before the Parliament by the Government, as is its responsibility. I guess we should be pleased that the professionalism of our forces has again been recognised. A similar movement control unit was, as you would know, Mr Deputy President, put into Cambodia at the request of the UN. Apparently its work has been internationally accepted as being of an excellent standard, and it played a very major part in allowing the improved coordination of the work of UNTAC in Cambodia. There is no doubt that as a result of that record Australia has again been asked to assist. We should recognise that we are assisting in a very difficult environment. There are risks that our forces will be taking and the Australian Government should be properly putting before the Parliament a full and detailed statement of all relevant matters in order that the issues might be properly debated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I reiterate that, on the basis of the very scant evidence that we have to date, we nevertheless support in principle the decision that the Australian Government has made. We simply ask for that statement to be put down in order that it might be properly debated as soon as possible. </PARA>

I refer to Mr Jack Davenport, A.C., D.S.O., D.F.C. and Bar, G.M., and fellow of the Australian Institute of Management.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Jack Davenport was the last of the Fraser Government appointees to the Reserve Bank. He served three five-year terms and retired on 29 December 1992, leaving a large gap of experience on the Reserve Bank board, experience he generated over many years as a distinguished businessman. He is still Chairman of the Australian Gas Light Company and Volvo Australia Pty Ltd and a Director of Alcoa Australia Ltd, Colinta Holdings Pty Ltd, Dalgety Farmers Ltd and the Munich Reinsurance Company of Australia Ltd, Deputy Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Heart Research Institute and Chairman of the Development Council of the Heart Research Institute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have known Jack Davenport for a long time. When he was with Monier Ltd, which he joined in 1946, I was a journalist on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>. At that time Monier was having a great deal of difficulty with the Americans, curiously enough over the funding of and payment for the North-West Cape telecommunications facility. Monier strongly contested that it had not been adequately paid because of specific difficulties in erecting that facility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over many years I dealt very directly with Jack Davenport and I found him to be a man of outstanding integrity and directness, apart from being a decent and honourable fellow. He became managing director of Monier in 1970 and continued in that job until 1982. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were many other companies with which Jack Davenport was involved. He was a director of Mt Isa Mines, through its MIM Holdings Ltd, until his retirement from that in 1990. He was a Director of Qantas Ltd, from which he retired in 1990. He was also on the Australian Council of Science and Technology, the Australian War Memorial Council, a member of the Board of Review of the Independent Commission Against Corruption, Governor of the National Institute for Labour Studies Ian Clunies Ross Foundation, Federal Vice-President of the Air Force Association, Member of the Federal Council and Chairman of the New South Wales division of the Institute of Directors. He was a RAAF wing commander. Apart from all those other decorations he was mentioned in dispatches in 1943 and he had been in the Army from 1937 to 1940. He was awarded the Sir John Storey Medal in 1982 at the Australian Institute of Management. I also saw a great deal of him in that role because I was on the Institute of Management's annual report award committee, with which he was closely involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Button was very gracious in making some remarks about Mr Davenport, which should be stated in this chamber. Senator Button said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Throughout his long association, Mr Davenport has epitomised the model board member,&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is of the Reserve Bank&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">always well-prepared, and reflecting a national perspective, he brought informed comments and commonsense judgements to the board's deliberations.</PARA>
<PARA>I must say amen to all that. I think it is unfortunate that perhaps there is not some more significant way that Australia could honour Jack Davenport. He has been a loyal, outstanding servant of his nation, an outstanding businessman and has been a distinguished member of the Reserve Bank for 15 years. I do not know of any other outside director who has had such a long and distinguished record of support. I hope that in his retirement, at least from the Reserve Bank board and not from all his other boards, he has greater time to participate in the golf, gardening, bridge and stud cattle breeding that I know he enjoys. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like very briefly to move to another matter. I simply wish to underline and strengthen a couple of points I made today when Senator Button very foolishly made a totally wrong statement about whether other directors were entitled to any of the $8.4m of shareholders' equity that now exists in Euphron Pty Ltd&mdash;at least it existed on 30 June 1991&mdash;a company half owned by the Prime Minister, Mr Paul Keating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Senate is aware, I have long been expressing interest in the fact that Mr Keating and his family managed to buy for $430,000 in mid-June 1991 an asset which was reported by the company itself to be worth $4.2m&mdash;half of $8.4m&mdash;by 30 June, which was just six weeks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is the shareholders' equity as reported in the documents I tabled&mdash;if the honourable senator had been interested enough to look at them&mdash;after Question Time. According to the ASC return forms, that is what the company says is the value of its shareholders' equity. And, yes, that is the net of all borrowings&mdash;if that is the burden of the honourable senator's inquiry. It is the shareholders' equity as described by the company.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Button was foolish enough to say, `Ah, but there were other shareholders in the company at that time'. Of course, Senator Button was right. There were two other shareholders according to the company's return. They were the holders of redeemable preference shares. They had no right to be holders of redeemable preference shares, and I will deal with that in passing because it is yet another example of this group's total incompetence or else its determination to mislead. I do not know which it is because it seems to me to be impossible that anyone could be as incompetent as this group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But let us acknowledge the fact that, yes, two people held J-class redeemable preference shares which were not redeemed until 10 August 1991, according to the return to the Australian Securities Commission which I tabled today in the Senate. However, when I look at the articles of association of the company, in section 125B I see the statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subject to the provisions of Section 120 of the Companies Code the next issue of shares of any class or classes after the issue of the subscribers' shares and payment up in full thereof shall be deemed to have been issued for the purposes of redeeming the subscribers' shares provided that the number of shares so issued is at least equal to the number of subscribers' shares on issue. Upon the issue of such shares the subscribers' shares shall ipso facto be redeemed at par and the issued capital of the company shall then stand at an amount equal to the par value of the total number of shares which comprise the next issue of shares.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, those shares should have been totally redeemed, and I understand that they were. But what interests me is why the J shares still appeared on 10 August. I guess that is a matter which the company itself can establish. The fact is that in relation to these J shares the company states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The `J' class redeemable preference shares shall carry no voting rights whatsoever. The said `J' class redeemable preference shares shall confer upon the holders thereof the right to payment of such non-cumulative dividends&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>none were paid&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">as the directors of the company may from time to time recommend and as the company may pursuant to these articles declare and shall in respect to payments of any dividends so declared rank pari passu with all other classes of shares in the capital of the company on which dividends may be declared.</PARA>
<PARA>It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subject to the provisions of Section 120 of the Code, the company reserves the right at any time or from time to time to redeem at par such of the said redeemable preference shares as it may from time to time determine.</PARA>
<PARA>I underline this, because it means that what Senator Button was telling us was that somehow some other shareholders were entitled to some slice of this $8.4m, which is really in effect shared between Mr Keating's family company and another company called Sephrenia Pty Ltd, and in which Mr Keating's share is $4.2m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Senator Button was saying that there were other shareholders, he was trying to put to us that there were other shareholders with some significant&mdash;or at least meaningful, otherwise he would not have mentioned it&mdash;interest in this $4.2m that really relates to Mr Keating's interest. In fact, we find those J shares redeemable at par&mdash;a total of $200. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All I suggest to Senator Button is that before he makes a fool of himself again he goes and has a good look at the details. If he wants a quick coaching course on how to read annual accounts, I will give it to him, but it is ludicrous that he should suggest that this diminishes in any way the reality that Mr Keating magically was able to buy for $430,000 a half interest in a company which says its shareholders' equity is $8.4m&mdash;in other words, giving him an entitlement to shareholders' equity stated by the company to be worth $4.2m. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have previously raised both in the Senate and in the Estimates Committees questions concerning the desperate plight of thousands of Christian hill tribespeople who have been forcibly relocated to camps in Dimawso and Pruso on the plains in northern central Burma. There are thousands and thousands of these people. After they have been shifted out and relocated from the hills to the plains, their homes and villages have been burned, their crops destroyed and they are virtually friendless. They are in a desperate plight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today I noted a Reuters report entitled `Slaves of new Burma railway . . . dying one a day'. It reported that these hills tribesmen have been forced to work as virtual slave labourers on the new railway and have been dying from malnutrition and disease. The report indicates that at least 90 people have died&mdash;mainly elderly people and children&mdash;since they have been relocated over the past six months. There is a lot of malnutrition and ill-health in the camps. But the interesting part about this is that Lieutenant Colonel Than Han of the Burmese Government's Border Areas Development Committee defended the SLORC policy of using this type of labour and he said that in return for their work the labourers were given medical treatment. In fact they are slave labourers. He says, `No, they are given medical treatment'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that we really do have to do something urgently about this situation. At the Estimates Committee hearing I asked whether our Ambassador was able to go to these areas and look at the problem. The Government is being advised by the Ambassador and, of course, its policies are considered having regard to the ambassadorial reports. The Ambassador in fact had requested to go on an inspection of the area, but his request was refused by the SLORC on the ground that the trip would be dangerous because of rebel activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That can be taken with a pinch of salt. This is an area which is policed by heavily armed troops of the SLORC, which is forcing persons to work on the railway, and it has the audacity to suggest that our Ambassador cannot go to the area because of rebel activity. Is it not able to protect our Ambassador? What will the Australian Minister for Foreign</PARA>
<PARA>Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) do about that?  The Minister and, indeed, the Government, the Opposition, the Australian Democrats and the Independents are all most concerned about this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I feel that a statement should be made to the Parliament by the Minister about the situation in Burma. Strong action is required in conjunction with other countries so as to bring SLORC to heel. I appeal to the Government  to bring in a statement which will strongly condemn the woeful violations of human rights in Burma and which will propose strong action by the world community against the SLORC Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, people are being lulled into a sense of unrealism because the statements that seem to be emanating from government circles indicate that there may be some improvement in the human rights situation. The problem is that people and diplomats, by and large, do not get out of Rangoon. There may be some improvements around the edges in Rangoon, but the reverse clearly is the case in the provinces and outlying areas where thousands and thousands of ordinary Burmese citizens are suffering dreadfully at the hands of this brutal regime currently in charge of Burma which should be ostracised by our Government and by governments of similar mind.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The dumping at sea of jarosite waste falls within the terms of resolution 43(13) of the London Dumping Convention. The resolution is not binding under international law, but as Australia supported it, there is a moral obligation upon Australia to abide by it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Pasminco is already on notice with respect to the 1995 deadline for the disposal of industrial wastes at sea. Clearly, however, there will be a range of issues which the Government and the company will need to address to meet this deadline. The only current alternative, landfill of jarosite, presents its own set of environmental problems and the Government sees no benefit merely by transferring the problem from the sea to the land. Consequently, the Government with the cooperation of Pasminco, is seeking a long term solution that minimises overall environmental impact. It is a condition of the sea dumping permit that Pasminco investigate alternative technologies with a view to phasing out the sea dumping of jarosite. It is worth noting, however, that monitoring of the dumping operation has not, in fact, been able to ascertain any adverse effects on the marine environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) I understand that Budelco has for some years been a member of a consortium of zinc producers which has conducted research into methods of processing jarosite, and that no real progress has been made as a result of this collaborative effort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) No. Independent of the work of the consortium, Budelco has investigated oxygen-enriched flash smelting for processing jarosite. I understand, however, that the economics of this process are still being studied by Budelco.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) No. It is still under consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) I understand that Budelco has never applied for a sea dumping permit; the issue has never arisen as the plant is well inland, and has road access to land disposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) Yes. I am advised, however, that problems with leaching of metals into groundwater have led the Netherlands' authorities to require the company to cease further land disposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) The announcement in January 1991 referred to a groundwater containment scheme to recover leachate mainly from historical process residues (some dating from the turn of the century) but including jarosite.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) One.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) In accordance with the Government's commitment to the promotion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (ATSI) employment throughout the Australian Public Service, and recent directives to all Commonwealth Departments and Agencies, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has developed an ATSI Recruitment and Career Development Strategy which aims to increase the recruitment and retention of ATSI officers at all levels of the Department's operations. Initiatives that will facilitate the movement of ATSI officers generally into senior positions are outlined in the Strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to encouraging ATSI officers to pursue mainstream career development and training opportunities through the use of the Department's Development Diary and the Individual Career Path Planning Program, the Department also actively encourages participation in specific programs such as the ATSI Graduate Administrative Assistant program, the Department's Graduate and Associate Diploma courses, DFAT ATSI Scholarship program and in programs coordinated by the Department of Employment, Education and Training and the Public Service Commission (eg. Senior Women in Management, Executive Development Scheme, National ATSI Middle Managers Program etc.). The Department will also be incorporating into its organisational structure support measures aimed at retaining more ATSI officers at these levels.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department also employs one Torres Strait Islander at the SOG C level who is presently studying full time for a Master of Arts in International Relations at the University of Wollongong under Aboriginal Undergraduate Study Award Scheme conditions. An ATSI consultant at the SOG C level was engaged earlier in the year to formulate the Department's ATSI recruitment and career development strategy, and an executive officer will be recruited to an identified position at this level to carry out its implementation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Torres Strait Islander currently located in the Department's Torres Strait Liaison Office on Thursday Island was recently successful in obtaining an overseas posting which will enhance her opportunities for advancement within the Department.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) The Department's Torres Strait Treaty Liaison Officer (TSTLO), based on Thursday Island, consults regularly with the ATSIC regional office and with members of the Island Coordinating Council. ATSIC representatives attend meetings, held roughly on a quarterly basis, of the DFAT-coordinated IDC on the Torres Strait Treaty, and DFAT is represented on the ATSIC-coordinated Torres Strait Tripartite Forum, held annually in Cairns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ATSIC representatives normally attend Treaty consultative meetings attended by Papua New Guinea, including the Treaty Liaison Meeting and the Joint Advisory Council (JAC). Treaty Liaison Meetings are usually held annually while the JAC normally meets biennially.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Departmental officers in Canberra who are responsible for the Treaty Liaison Office maintain regular contact with the Office of Torres Strait Islander Affairs on Treaty developments. When visiting Thursday Island they also consult with the Chairman of the Island Coordinating Council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More generally, the Department consults closely with ATSIC as the need arises on particular ATSI related issues. For example, the Department recently contributed (for the first time) to an ATSIC coordinated Budget-related paper (No. 7 "Social Justice for Indigenous Australians 1992-93"). This publication provides details of the activities of the Department's International Organisations Branch, Cultural Relations Branch and Overseas Information Branch relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander issues and activities. There is also continuing consultation between DFAT and ATSIC concerning activities planned for the International Year of the World's Indigenous Peoples (IYWIP) in 1993. The Department is a member of the ATSIC-coordinated IDC responsible for developing Australia's activities for the Year.</PARA>
