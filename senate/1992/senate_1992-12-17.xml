This will result in less accessibility for country businessmen and travellers alike, will increase the costs of business for rural people and threatens the viability of many smaller airlines who provide valuable services to rural towns.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, you would be aware that the Senate does appoint senators to the National Library Council, the National Archives Council, the Australian National University, and one other body. In view of the recent High Court decision in the Cleary case, I wonder whether you would be able to obtain a legal opinion as to whether, in regard to those senators so appointed, that could be construed as an office of profit under the Crown. They are certainly not paid in any of those positions, but you might say there is status for a senator to be so appointed. I am the Senate representative on the National Archives Council, on which I am very pleased to serve. Is that capable of being construed as an office of profit under the Crown? I think it is something that needs to be cleared up. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Michael,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to the Marriage Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1992 No.294, considered by the Committee at its meeting of 5 November 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The regulations provide for increases in fees. The Explanatory Statement advises that the fees were last increased in 1990 and then states that the increase `reflects the movements in the Consumer Price Index for the period under review (January 1990 to December 1991).' However, one increase is from $8 to $15, an increase of 87.5%; two are from $12 to $18, an increase of 50%; and one is from $30 to $40, an increase of 33.3%. In fact, these increases do not appear to reflect the CPI increase during the period.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Loosley</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 5 November 1992 to the Attorney-General concerning the increase in fees contained in the Marriage Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1992 No 294.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I have responsibility for matters relating to the Marriage Regulations, I provide the following comments in respect of the increases in the prescribed fees to which you refer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the recent review of the fees contained in the Fifth Schedule of the Marriage Regulations, the State and Territory Registrars of Births, Deaths and Marriages were invited to provide comments and suggestions on the fees, for consideration. The Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages, Canberra who also has the function of Registrar of Overseas Marriages, requested an increase for three different fees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These increases were as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Item 4: Increase from $12.00 to $18.00. This is a fee payable for searches in the Register of Foreign Marriages and the issue of a copy of an entry. Fees for similar matters throughout all Registries range from $15.00 to $27.00.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Item 5: Increase from $8.00 to $15.00. This is a fee payable for searches in the Register of Foreign Marriages and issue of an extract of an entry. Fees for similar matters range from $10.00 to $17.00.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Item 10: Increase from $12.00 to $18.00. This is the fee payable for issuing a copy of a document received under subsection 85(1) (document issued to the couple in the country of marriage). Fees for similar matters range from $15.00 to $27.00.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The above fees were last increased in 1988 (for the review period of January 1986 to December 1987). I consider the increases sought to be appropriate to reflect the fees payable for similar searches and issue of documents throughout all Registries of Births, Deaths and Marriages.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The increases from $30.00 to $40.00 relates to the fee payable at the lodgement of the Notice of Intended Marriage (Item 11) with the civil or registry marriage celebrant. This fee is one part of the normal, or common, fee payable to solemnise a civil marriage. The common fee comprises $40.00 (Notice of Intended Marriage&mdash;increased from $30.00 to $40.00); $65.00 (solemnisations of marriage&mdash;fee unchanged) and $20.00 (travel fee for first 30 kilometres travelled by celebrant&mdash;increased from $18.00 to $20.00). The common fee, previously $113.00, has therefore been increased to $125.00, an increase of $12.00, or 10.6%, which compares with the increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) of 6.7% (for period January 1990-December 1991)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I trust the above comments clarify the reasons for the recent increases contained in the Marriage Regulations.</PARA>

We assume that this information is needed for reconciliation of reimbursement. However, we would appreciate further advice on the provisions which authorise the collection of such information, who has access to it, what safeguards exist for its protection and whether its collection accords with the Privacy Principles.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Steve</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter of 5 November 1992 in which you ask several questions in relation to the Form NH20, which is approved by the disallowable instrument made under paragraph 40AA(6)(ce) of the National Health Act 1953 ("the Act").</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The information which is collected on the NH20 is, as you have surmised, necessary for the reconciliation of actual expenditure against Commonwealth nursing home benefit advanced under the Act, as well as verification of claims for benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subsection 61(1) of the Act requires proprietors of approved nursing homes to keep such records as would enable claims for Commonwealth benefits to be verified.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Information collected on the NH20 is subject to the secrecy provision contained in section 135A of the Act, which precludes the disclosure, to any person, of any information with respect to the affairs of a third person, acquired in the performance of duties, or in the exercise of powers or functions, under the Act. The only persons who have access to the information are persons performing such duties, or exercising such powers or functions under the Act. Severe penalties are applicable for breaches of section 135A.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I can assure you that the collection of NH20 information is  carried out in accordance with the Information Privacy Principles under the Privacy Act 1988. The information is collected for a lawful purpose, that is, to enable the reconciliation of expenditure against claims for Commonwealth benefit, and the verification of those claims. Paragraph 40AA(6)(ce) of the Act provides that it is a condition of the approval of a nursing home that the proprietor submits information relating to the employment of nursing and personal care staff in a form approved by the Secretary of the Department.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The detailed nature of the information required by the form is necessary to identify specific actual costs incurred by the proprietor of a nursing home in relation to nursing and personal care staff and other cost reimbursed expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The information which is collected does not exceed that which is necessary for the purposes of reconciliation and verification, and the reasons for its collection are clearly set out on the form. I hope that this will be of assistance to the Committee.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to Locally Engaged Staff Determinations 1992/18, 1992/22 and 1992/27, considered by the Committee at its meeting of 6 November 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first Determination revises salary rates for locally engaged staff in Malta while the second corrects parts of the first. The third Determination revises salary rates and provides for other matters for locally engaged staff in Czechoslovakia.</PARA>

This would seem to be the intention and effect of the way these provisions are drafted. In addition, the Explanatory Statement of 1992/18 advises that it inserts `a clause which authorises payment to LES of salary increases decreed by the Maltese Government'.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Steve,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter of 5 November 1992 about Locally Engaged Staff (LES) Determinations 1992/18, 1992/22 and 1992/27. I refer also to LES Determination 1992/31 which, together with the other three determinations, was the subject of notice of motion of disallowance in the Senate given on 25 November 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to comment first on some general features of the policy which underpins determination of salary and conditions of employment for LES.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The overall aim is to maintain current LES provisions with reference to another reputable employer who provides up-todate employment arrangements. In the great majority of countries, pay and conditions norms are adopted by reference to United States practice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a matter of policy, the Government wants to ensure that LES, who are largely nationals of countries in which Australia is represented, are treated appropriately according to local law and good employer practice in those countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These determinations apply only to staff who are employed outside Australia and who in many cases are not native English speakers. Relying on local law and employer practice calls up the system with which LES are most familiar. This process supports the Committee's aims of ensuring clarity of and access to the law by those directly affected, and provides better protection for their rights than if their full conditions of employment were set out in English in Australia and subject only to Australian courts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">LES thereby remain subject to local employment codes and can litigate in local courts if necessary; I understand that Australia does not claim immunity from litigation on LES employment matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I attach a report provided by the Department which provides background information on the four determinations queried by the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I accept that there may be some ambiguity in the determinations in question. To remove this ambiguity, a new LES amending determination (1992/38) has been made and is attached for the Committee's information.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">LES Determination 1992/18 (Malta salaries) could be read as adopting Maltese law as in force from time to time. However within two months of its commencement the clause in question was repealed by LES Determination 1992/22, which put in its place a modification of the normal authority for automatic adjustment of Malta salaries. The modification does not adopt Maltese law, but prescribes a change to the adjustment process when the benchmark salaries of United States employees are increased as a result of the operation of Maltese law. The amending determination includes a clause to ensure that this change is made effective from the date of commencement of LES Determination 1992/18.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the redundancy conditions inserted by LES Determination 1992/27 (Czechoslovakia) was to provide for LES to enjoy redundancy entitlements consistent with local law as in force at the date of commencement of the determination.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments made by LES Determination 1992/38 specify that the redundancy entitlements referred to are those in force in local law on that date. As the Embassy has now closed, the Czechoslovakian provisions are redundant and will be repealed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similarly, LES Determination 1992/31 (Ireland redundancy conditions) was also made to deal with a specific excess staff situation. The Department has amended the provision to limit the scope of the reference to Irish law to the date on which LES Determination 1992/31 became effective.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Neal</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to Statutory Instrument No. 46 of 1992 under s.1315 of the Social Security Act 1991, considered by the Committee of 12 November 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The instrument sets out the guidelines under which the Secretary may give a certificate for the disclosure of information about a person.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It provides that information may be disclosed where the information cannot reasonably be obtained from another source and the person seeking it has an interest in obtaining it. It then prescribes the circumstances in which information may be released. In brief these are where there is an imminent threat to life or health; where the disclosure is reasonably necessary for the enforcement of the criminal law or of a law imposing a pecuniary penalty, or for the protection of the public revenue; or, in specified circumstances, where the disclosure concerns a deceased person, a missing person or an abducted person.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee noted that Parliament took the conferral of the power to make such a determination very seriously for, most unusually, s.1315(3) provides that a determination does not take effect until the determination `is no longer liable to be disallowed, or to be deemed to be disallowed'. Thus it is particularly appropriate that the Committee should take its usual care in scrutinising the instrument.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The disclosure provision in clause 2(2) relating to the criminal law, pecuniary penalties or public revenue is very widely drawn and would, in theory, seem to cover everything from murder to unpaid parking fines. Nevertheless, despite this wide ambit, the Explanatory Statement does appear at first to indicate that it is a power that would be used only in serious cases when it states that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">`Typical offences concern murder, armed robbery, drugs, child abuse, and the abduction of children'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, it does then go on to mention, for example, the use of the provision:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">`to pursue a person who damages Commonwealth property in an altercation with the Department to recover compensation from the person'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This confirms our view that the provision is very wide and we seek your detailed advice. For instance, if personal information was requested about a person who had not paid a parking fine, would the information be provided? If not, what criteria are used to decide whether to release the information?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the Committee noted that the Explanatory Statement mentions that the provisions are `aligned with' or `reflect' Information Privacy Principle 11, or are  `constructed with Information Privacy Principle 11 of the Privacy Act 1988 in mind'. Given this emphasis, we ask whether the Privacy Commissioner was specifically consulted about the instrument and, if so, whether its terms have the Commissioner's approval.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Stephen</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 12 November 1992 about Statutory Instrument No 46 of 1992 under section 1315 of the Social Security Act 1991. You took the view that clause 2(2) of the instrument was very wide and sought my detailed advice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The instrument applies where the Secretary of my Department (or a delegate) is considering whether to release personal information about a person to someone else in a situation where it may be necessary in the public interest to release that information. This is the "public interest" test in paragraph 1314(1)(a) of the Act. It is a severe test which is not readily met.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The social security legislation has always had this test and its use has been carefully guarded over many years. There is now an additional element that must be met. A condition in the instrument under section 1315 must also be satisfied.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important to recognise that meeting one of those conditions in clause 2 of the instrument is not enough to enable the release of information. Clause 1 of the instrument must be satisfied and it must still be that the release is necessary in the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the example you mention of a person who had not paid a parking fine, it may be that the condition in clause 2(2) of the instrument would be met. However, it is difficult to see that the release of any information about that person (such as his or her whereabouts) would be necessary in the public interest. I do not think that this could happen. It has not happened in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, it is unlikely that clause 1 of the instrument would be satisfied eg information about the whereabouts of the offender could be obtained from the relevant licensing authority (see clause 1(1)(a)).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The criteria used in deciding whether to release information are:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is it necessary in the public interest that the information be released?</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is clause 1 of the instrument satisfied?</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is a condition mentioned in clause 2 of the instrument met?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Each of these criteria must be satisfied.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The criteria are strict. The first, as mentioned above, is a severe test which is not readily met. The second test limits the scope of the public interest test, and the third test is a further limit which reflects current Commonwealth privacy legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You also asked whether the Privacy Commissioner was specifically consulted about the instrument and, if so, whether its terms have his approval.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commissioner was specifically consulted about the instrument by my Department. A copy of the relevant correspondence is attached for your information. You will see that the Commissioner had some reservations about clause 2(2) and the Department's response to that.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I also take the power to make this determination very seriously and I welcome the Committee's scrutiny of it. However, the situation which obtained when the power to make the instrument was introduced into the Act has changed, as the attached correspondence describes. The original instrument being replaced now has much less scope than it first had. The instrument the Committee is considering should be seen in this larger context.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Against this background, I believe that the instrument strikes a reasonable balance between what is in the public interest and the need for the confidentiality of personal information.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 30 November 1992 about Statutory Instrument No 46 of 1992 under section 1315 of the Social Security Act 1991. You asked for further information on three matters to assist the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, as requested, a copy of the letter of 13 August 1992 from Mr Ross to the Privacy Commissioner is attached.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Second, the instructions to departmental staff are under review to ensure that they correctly reflect what the Government has approved and what the Department and other agencies do in practice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This review includes giving effect to the suggestions made by the Privacy Commissioner in his letter to the Secretary of 4 September 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Secretary will be seeking the Privacy Commissioner's views when a draft instrument comes out of the review, as indicated in the Secretary's letter to the Privacy Commissioner of 21 September 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Third, the suggestion made by the Privacy Commissioner that case examples be incorporated into the determination was taken into consideration. This refers to item (2) of clause 2 of the instrument. He made that suggestion so that the boundaries of intended practice would match the boundaries set by law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provision being referred to is in identical terms to Information Privacy Principle 11(1)(e) of the Privacy Act 1988. This suggestion was interpreted as requiring the generality of item (2) of clause 2 to be replaced by more specific items rather than retaining item (2) of clause 2 and incorporating examples.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Secretary dealt with this issue in his letter of 21 September 1992 when he explained the need for the general item and said that he thought it was reasonable to leave the item more open-ended and to see how it works in practice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has been little difficulty in practice with IPP 11(1)(e) although you may be aware that there have been differences between the Privacy Commissioner and the Attorney-General's Department about its interpretation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I doubt if these differences have any significance for this instrument, and it does seem a sensible approach to see how the instrument works in practice.</PARA>

I am wondering why he is seeking to do that. If the Bill that was rushed through the House of Representatives this morning is part of that procedure, I believe that the procedure is not appropriate, and that we should know about that as soon as possible. If it is not part of that procedure, when are we likely to know about that matter? I happen to know about it. I was informed about it before the Minister informed me late last night; I had heard what was going on. When the time comes, I will be able to address that matter.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to make a number of amendments to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983. These amendments are intended to:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">Enhance accountability arrangements for the ABC;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">Improve administrative arrangements under the Act; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">Reflect changes to the arrangements for the transmission of ABC programs. </PARA>
<PARA>There are, in addition, a number of minor technical amendments to the ABC Act.</PARA>
<PARA>I now turn to the detail of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Although the ABC is primarily budget funded and the Parliament can scrutinise the ABC's activities through the details of its appropriation, the ABC is also involved in some commercial activities, in relation to which there is a need for more stringent accountability arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>These commercial activities, which include the production, licensing and sales of program related products, are authorised by the ABC Act or implicit within the ABC's charter. Although the ABC is subject to the Trade Practices Act and to most State regulatory controls, it enjoys some competitive advantages over private businesses, including:  exemptions from State and Commonwealth taxes, (except sales tax and customs duty on goods for resale); exemptions from many corporate regulatory requirements; access to publicly funded infrastructure; and free radio and television promotions. </PARA>
<PARA>The potential problems with the ABC involvement in competitive business activities are:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">That under the protection of public ownership and subsidy, the ABC may deter private businesses from entering a particular market, or may unfairly disadvantage any business which is in that market; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">That those budget funded activities, which have traditionally been considered the prime functions of the ABC, such as its free to air television and radio services may suffer from the ABC's involvement in non-traditional commercial and semi-commercial activities</PARA>
<PARA>To minimise the risk to taxpayer's funds, detriment to the quality of free to air programming and to address concerns about the ABC's competitive advantage, this Bill will apply more rigorous financial accountability requirements. The amendments will apply new corporate planning and annual reporting requirements for the ABC embracing all of its functions and are consistent with provisions already approved by parliament as part of the Special Broadcasting Services Act 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the proposed arrangements, the ABC will be required to include in its corporate plan, its objectives and overall strategies for fulfilling its functions. The plan will also have to include forecasts of revenue and expenditure (including capital expenditure and borrowings), as well as performance indicators, for all authorised businesses in which the ABC participates. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition to the corporate planning requirements, the ABC Board will be required to include in its annual report, an assessment of the extent to which its operations have achieved the corporate plan objectives and to disclose the particulars of business activities carried out during the year, including those conducted through subsidiary companies or joint ventures. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government will monitor the effects of these amendments and if it considers that they do not resolve the problem of unfair competition or that commercial activities are imposing undue risk to funds appropriated for charter purposes, the government will consider the need for further legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill contains a number of minor amendments which are intended to enhance the administrative efficiency of the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA>The first of these deal with the transfer of responsibility for some routine administrative decisions from the ABC Board to the corporation. These include decisions about the publishing of journals, making of sound recordings etc, and setting charges for these items. I believe that it is entirely appropriate that the board should not be required, by the legislation, to be involved in what are clearly routine administrative matters for which officers of the ABC are responsible on a daily basis. </PARA>
<PARA>The board will retain ultimate responsibility for determining what constitutes an advertisement, for the purposes of the Act, and for the annual report of the ABC, but the Bill amends the Act to make it clear that the board does not have to be involved in the day-to-day administration of these activities. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill also contains an amendment to modify the existing provisions allowing the ABC to enter into hedging contracts. The purpose of this amendment is to clarify that the ABC can enter into hedging contracts or other arrangements, in relation to borrowings approved by the Treasurer, in the absence of ministerial guidelines. The ABC act currently empowers the ABC to enter into hedging contracts and enables the Minister to issue guidelines governing ABC involvement in hedging contracts. To date there has been no need to develop guidelines but there has been some uncertainty about whether the ABC can enter into hedging arrangements in the absence of guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendment provides clarification that the ABC can enter into hedging contracts or arrangements in the absence of guidelines but retains the power of the Minister to determine guidelines, if the Minister considers it necessary. </PARA>
<PARA>The final administrative amendment deals with the determination of recreation leave entitlements for the managing director of the ABC. This is consequential to an amendment to the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973 which empowered the Remuneration Tribunal to determine standard recreation leave entitlements for all full-time public office holders. The objective was to ensure the same formal recreation leave entitlements for these office holders as their equivalents in the Australian Public Service. The amendment to the ABC Act provides that the Remuneration Tribunal will determine the recreation leave entitlements for the managing director of the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA>It is the responsibility of the Minister for Transport and Communications to provide facilities for the transmission of national broadcasting services. In July of this year, the National Transmission Agency was established with the specific purpose of providing, operating and maintaining the Commonwealth network of transmission facilities. </PARA>
<PARA>Initially the National Transmission Agency is operating as a separate cost centre within the Department of Transport and Communications. Its conversion to a government business enterprise will be considered by government next year. In view of the establishment of the National Transmission Agency, the Bill amends the ABC act to remove the provision for the Minister to transfer to the ABC, technical equipment and land relating to transmitting stations used for the purpose of broadcasting the programs of the ABC to the public. The Bill also enables the ABC to arrange for the delivery of its programs to the public. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, the Bill contains some minor technical amendments to the ABC Act. </PARA>
<PARA>The first of these is intended to correct an anomaly in the ABC Act which has occurred in the drafting of provisions in the Broadcasting Services (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 1992. These provisions, unintentionally, preclude the ABC from charging for subscription services which have been declared to be national services under the Broadcasting Services Act 1992. The proposed amendment corrects the anomaly and thereby provides scope for the Minister for Transport and Communications to allow the ABC to operate services, the costs of which are met in full, or part by the audience, through subscriptions. It is envisaged that this provision would only be used in special circumstances and that most subscription services that may be offered by the ABC would be subject to the same regulatory regime as other commercial services under the Broadcasting Services Act. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill also amends the ABC Act to simplify and update the technical provisions along the lines of those included in the Special Broadcasting Service Act. These amendments are necessary because the current provisions in the ABC act are based on archaic concepts no longer used in broadcasting legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill also amends the ABC Act to make its provisions non-gender specific in line with current drafting policy. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendments in the Bill will not alter the costs or revenues of the Commonwealth. They do not require the application of additional resources by the ABC to meet its obligations or to comply with its establishment and management responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA>Sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act which prohibit secondary boycotts and agreements giving effect to secondary boycotts were introduced into the Trade Practices Act by the Fraser Government. Section 45D has operated since 1977 and Section 45E since 1980. </PARA>
<PARA>During the entire period of its existence, section 45D has not been widely accepted as a provision concerned with competition&mdash;rather it has become more a weapon directed at the industrial relations activities of trade unions under the guise of competition policy. The Fraser Government amended section 45D in 1978 and 1980 to broaden its application against union activities. In addition, during 1980, section 45E was introduced into the Trade Practices Act. Section 45D commonly operates to prohibit boycott situations arising from a refusal by employees to handle goods intended for a third party for the purpose of pressuring the third party to accede to certain demands. Section 45E supplements that provision by prohibiting contracts, arrangements or understandings between a union and another person to prevent or hinder the supply of goods or services to, or their acquisition from, a third party. </PARA>
<PARA>Sections 45D and 45E have been the subject of considerable controversy since their introduction. The essential concern of the trade practices legislation is to promote fair trading and free competition. On the other hand, the real purpose of sections 45D and 45E is to prohibit union activity which usually has little or no detrimental effect on competition or fair trading. In the context of legislation dealing with trade practices matters, the sections provide unrealistic sanctions to be applied against unions in relation to their industrial activities. </PARA>
<PARA>The principal objective of any regulation in the area of secondary boycotts must be the speedy, fair and effective resolution of the underlying dispute. This is not achieved by the legislative prohibition of secondary boycott activity. Indeed, provisions such as sections 45D and 45E may only serve to exacerbate a dispute and resort to them may result in a worsened industrial relations climate not only between the parties, but in the relevant industry as a whole The special characteristics of industry disputes demand that they be handled by expert bodies under our industrial machinery rather than under trade practices legislation which is not designed to resolve the underlying issues which give rise to the boycott activity. </PARA>
<PARA>Action under the Trade Practices Act in respect of secondary boycott disputes is neither the most appropriate course for resolution of the dispute nor necessarily a particularly quick or effective course of action. In some cases the issuing of injunctions under the Trade Practices Act has even exacerbated disputes. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1984, the Hawke Government moved to change the arrangements to deal with secondary boycotts, through the Trade Practices Amendment Bill 1984 and the Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1984. The intention was to repeal sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act and to replace them with a more effective mechanism for dealing with secondary boycotts under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. </PARA>
<PARA>At the time, Senator Button, introducing the Bills into the Senate said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's position is absolutely plain&mdash;the Government does not, in any way, condone the industrial tactic of a secondary boycott. However, the Government does not believe that such action is so different in nature to other forms of union and employee action in support of their industrial claims that it should be singled out to be dealt with under the Trade Practices Act, rather than through the established industrial channels.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is concerned about the possible effect of the remedies of penalties and damages which are available under the Trade Practices Act for contraventions of Sections 45D and 45E. These are potentially highly disruptive to Australia's industrial relations. Their application, where boycotts occur, is unlikely to lead to the effective or satisfactory resolution of a dispute.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following our repeal of these Sections, the Government is not proposing to leave a void in the handling of such disputes. Let no-one underestimate our concern at the impact of these disputes. What the Government is proposing is an alternative mechanism whereby such disputes can be dealt with, in the first instance, through the established industrial relations machinery. Such a course of action will ensure that boycott matters are dealt with effectively and speedily through the tribunal best qualified to deal with them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, the Government proposes that, upon the repeal of Sections 45D and 45E, the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission should be able to deal with such disputes where a federally registered union or its members, or work under a federal award is involved. We believe this should also apply where these boycott disputes do not concern strictly industrial issues. The Commission should be able to bring the parties together to see if they can settle their differences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We propose to allow the Commission to conciliate in relation to these disputes. This is similar to what exists at the moment, but with a significant improvement. Instead of the delays under the present arrangements which require the initiation of Federal Court proceedings under Section 45D or 45E, anyone involved in or affected by a boycott dispute will be able to notify the Commission immediately, and the Commission will also be able to act of its own motion. These matters should be dealt with as quickly as possible by the Commission and provision is to be made to ensure that this will be done.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation will enable the Commission to deal with boycott disputes in relation to both industrial matters and non-industrial issues. Industrial matters will be the same as those which the Commission can deal with in its normal jurisdiction except that they will not require a particular employment relationship. Security of employment which sometimes gives rise to boycott disputes will be included as an industrial matter for the purposes of the Commission's jurisdiction under this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do not believe that the Commission should be asked to deal with boycott disputes over non-industrial issues if it cannot play any useful part in their resolution. Provision will therefore be made to require the Commission to make a threshold judgement as to whether it will be able to resolve the dispute or bring about an end to the industrial action. It may be unrealistic, for example, to expect the Commission to play a role in overcoming a boycott which has an explicitly political basis, such as a ban in protest against aspects of Government policy.</PARA>
<PARA>I have quoted extensively from Senator Button's 1984 speech because this Bill is written in exactly the same terms and is put forward for the same reasons. </PARA>
<PARA>The only variation arises from the fact that the amendments are now to the Trade Practices Act and the Industrial Relations Act which has replaced the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. </PARA>
<PARA>The views expressed by the Government in 1984 are widely shared. </PARA>
<PARA>ACTU policy states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act prohibit a wide range of legitimate industrial action by unions, members and officials. They should be repealed at the earliest possible opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Trade Practices Act is a totally unacceptable vehicle through which to attempt to regulate the legitimate industrial activities of trade unions. The Act should be used only for promoting free competition and fair trading by business enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Section 45D actions that have been taken against unions clearly demonstrate that the Trade Practices Act is not merely useless in settling industrial disputes but is positively harmful. The special characteristics of industrial disputes demand that they be dealt with under industrial legislation and not by recourse to the Trade Practices Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The so-called conciliation procedures provided under the Industrial Relations Act in respect of Section 45D and 45E disputes are a sham. They are intended merely to facilitate the enforcement of those sections and do not provide a genuine opportunity for the industrial relations merits of a dispute to be examined and an acceptable resolution sought.</PARA>
<PARA>The ILO in a Direct Request to the Australian Government in 1991, relating to Convention No. 87, Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise, has had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In its 1989 direct request the Committee noted that Section 45D of the Trade Practices Act 1974, rendered unlawful a wide range of boycott activity and most, if not all, sympathy action. The Committee considers that both of these forms of industrial action should be permissible in certain circumstances. For example, it should be possible to impose boycotts in relation to health and safety disputes on construction sites where there are several different employers. It should be permissible for workers to have recourse to sympathetic action where the initial strike in respect of which such action is taken is itself a legitimate exercise of the right to strike. These considerations led the Committee to ask the Government to provide information as to the practical application of Section 45D and its associated provisions, and to indicate whether it had any plans to amend the 1974 Act so as to bring it into conformity with the requirements of the Convention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee remains of the view that Section 45D and its associated provisions render unlawful certain forms of industrial action which ought to be permissible. Accordingly, it calls upon the Government again to take steps to bring this legislation into full conformity with the requirements of the Convention.</PARA>
<PARA>The Trade Practices Commission itself, in its fourth Annual Report (1978) said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission would propose to limit court proceedings it might bring to cases affecting competition . . . because it is probably more appropriate that the right of private action or the Minister's right to bring proceedings should be exercised in cases not affecting competition. The Commission is a competition authority and it would seem desirable to avoid, where competition is not affected, getting involved in industrial disputes where the ultimate decisions as to the continuing or settling cases may need to be taken by companies on commercial grounds or the government on political grounds.</PARA>
<PARA>When first requested by the ILO to deal with the problem it saw posed by sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act, the Government responded by pointing out that its attempt to repeal the provisions in 1984 was defeated in the Senate where the Government did not have control. It also cited `strenuous opposition' by major employer groups and the Parliamentary Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA>At this point, late in 1992, the Government faces an entirely different situation. Because of a change in the policy of the Australian Democrats, the Government will now have no difficulty in gaining passage of repeal measures through the Senate. Another change is the distinctly turbulent industrial relations climate with the advent of conservative State Governments&mdash;especially the Kennett Government in Victoria&mdash;and the strong promotion of similar highly deregulated industrial relations policies by the Federal coalition. In this climate, it is surely more vital than ever that appropriate secondary boycott provisions are in place. </PARA>
<PARA>A further and very recent disturbing element is a decision in Western Australia against the BLF in which a ruling was given that the union had acted against section 45D in mounting a picket&mdash;in spite of that picket being entirely peaceful and that the union had instructed the union officials not to stop anyone from crossing the picket nor direct or request anyone not to cross. </PARA>
<PARA>In its conclusion the court said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Contemporary usage of the term picket does carry implications of direction and threat of sanction to those who seek to enter a site or premises the subject of the picket. While the threat of sanction remains albeit unspoken the possibility of characterising the use of the picket as hindering or preventing of supply is also present.</PARA>
<PARA>Surely this judgement effectively denies the right to peacefully picket. Such a situation must not be tolerated. </PARA>
<PARA>In his conclusion to the debate in the Hawke Government amendments in 1984, Senator Button said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The place for dealing with industrial disputes is not in the hands of the Trade Practices Commission. We have said that on numerous occasions and we will say it again in the course of dealing with this legislation. It is a matter which was in the Labor platform well before we came to Government. It has been a consistent position.</PARA>
<PARA>The consistency was not evident when, on 15 December 1992, I put the provisions of this Bill as amendments to an Industrial Relations Bill in the Senate and the Government failed to support them. </PARA>
<PARA>Instead the Government referred the amendments to the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training inquiry on the effect of the operation of sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act 1974 on industrial relations in Australia. That inquiry was set up on 12 October 1992 on a motion of the Australian Democrats and has a reporting date of 31 May 1993. </PARA>
<PARA>Hence, we have the current situation in which the Australian Democrats, a party with a policy to repeal sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act, provided for the ALP Government, also with a policy of repeal, a vehicle which has been used by the Government to avoid the opportunity provided by my amendments to enact that very policy. </PARA>
<PARA>Also in his concluding speech in 1984, Senator Button claimed a `fundamental difference of attitude to the way in which industrial relations in this country should be handled'. </PARA>
<PARA>Given the Government's failure to repeal sections 45D and 45E on 16 December 1992, and the Democrats' provision of the escape route for the Government on that occasion, it is difficult to see that difference between any of the parties on this question. </PARA>

<PARA>The Administrative Appeals Tribunal Amendment Bill 1992 will amend the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975. The Bill contains amendments to the Act to give effect to recommendations of the Report of the Review of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The Bill will also amend the Act to provide for mediation and to provide that documents may be lodged by electronic means.</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill contains amendments of a minor policy nature and makes minor technical amendments to the Act. None of the amendments concern major policy proposals or sensitive policy issues. They are explained in the Explanatory Memorandum circulated with the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>It is expected that the proposed amendments will not have any financial impact. </PARA>
<PARA>In January 1990 the Act was amended, by the Courts and Tribunals Administration Amendment Act 1989, to provide that the President of the Tribunal is responsible for managing the administrative affairs of the Tribunal. Similar amendments were made to the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 and the Family Law Act 1975 to provide that the Chief Justices of the Federal and Family Courts are responsible for the administrative affairs of their respective courts. The process by which the heads of jurisdiction are responsible for the administration of a court or tribunal is known as separate administration. </PARA>
<PARA>Following the commencement of separate administration it was agreed that the operations of the Tribunal should be reviewed to assess the delivery of services by the Tribunal and the effectiveness and efficiency of the Tribunal's existing administrative operational arrangements and structures. The Review was conducted by representatives of the Tribunal, the Attorney-General's Department and the Department of Finance. Similar reviews were undertaken in the Federal Court of Australia and the Family Court of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The Review was deferred until the new President, the Hon Justice O'Connor, had the opportunity of familiarising herself with the operations of the Tribunal. Justice O'Connor was appointed as President in June 1990 following the death of the former President, the Hon Mr Justice Hartigan. </PARA>
<PARA>The Review was undertaken between October 1990 and November 1991. The Report of the Review made some 200 recommendations for reform. Many of those recommendations related to the internal operation of the Tribunal and have been implemented by the President of the Tribunal. The review also made a number of recommendations for amendments to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposed amendments are directed at streamlining the procedures of the Tribunal and clarifying the powers of the Tribunal in procedural matters. The amendments will enable the Tribunal to operate more flexibly and will assist the Tribunal to achieve maximum efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendments to section 20 of the Act will provide a clearer statement of the President's role and functions in relation to the arrangement of business of the Tribunal and will provide that the President may give directions as to the procedures to be followed generally in proceeding in the Tribunal and in particular to enable directions that members shall sit at particular places. </PARA>
<PARA>At present, subject to any provision to the contrary contained in an enactment conferring jurisdiction on the Tribunal, the Tribunal may be constituted in any one of the 5 ways as listed in section 21. Clause 6 will amend section 21 to provide for 2 additional combination of members, 3 Deputy Presidents or 2 Deputy Presidents and a non-presidential member. This will give the President greater flexibility in constituting the Tribunal in important or complex cases. </PARA>
<PARA>Section 29 of the Act specifies the manner of applying for a review. Clause 9 will amend section 29 to provide for an address for service where an applicant has failed to provide an address for service in the application. This will ensure that the processing of such applications is not unduly delayed by uncertainty as to the appropriate address for service. </PARA>
<PARA>In the recent decision of the Federal Court in Angus Fire Armour Pty Ltd v Collector of Customs (1988) 83 ALR 449 the Court held that, on the proper construction of section 29, an application to the Tribunal for a review of a decision is validly lodged notwithstanding the failure of the applicant to pay the application fee prescribed by the Regulations. In these circumstances, although the application would be deemed to be validly lodged, there would be no obligation on the Tribunal to process the application. Clause 10 will insert new section 29A which provides that an application is not taken to be lodged unless the prescribed fee has been paid. </PARA>
<PARA>The Tribunal currently makes extensive use of directions hearings. Section 33 of the Act provides for the procedure to be followed by the Tribunal. Clause 11 will amend section 33 to give formal recognition to directions hearings and to provide that a member convening a directions hearing may give such directions as are considered necessary, at any time in relation to any procedural matter, whether or not the President has expressly authorised the person to give directions. </PARA>
<PARA>Section 34 of the Act provides for conferences to be held. The Tribunal has developed the practice of convening preliminary conferences to determine the matters in issue prior to the hearing. As a significant proportion of cases are resolved at the preliminary conference this practice has proved an effective means of dealing with the workload of the Tribunal. Clause 12 will amend section 34 by giving the President a discretion to determine whether or not a conference should be held. It will also amend subsection 34(1) by deleting the reference to consideration of the material lodged so that the President may direct the holding of a conference without doing so. These amendments should further enhance the use of preliminary conferences. </PARA>
<PARA>Subsection 34(2) provides that where the parties reach an agreement at a preliminary conference, the Tribunal must, subject to certain procedural requirements, make a decision in accordance with the terms of that agreement. The Bill inserts new section 42C which will replace subsection 34(2). This section gives the Tribunal a discretion to decline to make a decision in terms of the agreement if it appears to the Tribunal that it is appropriate to do so. </PARA>
<PARA>This discretion is consistent with the role of the Tribunal to review decisions on their merits and to substitute its decision for that of the decision maker. In making a decision the Tribunal, in effect, stands in the shoes of the decision maker. It is inconsistent with the role of the Tribunal to require it to make a decision adopting the terms of an agreement between the parties where it considers that, in the circumstances of the case, the agreement would not result in the correct or preferable decision being made. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1991 the Tribunal began to consider the introduction of mediation as an alternative dispute resolution mechanism. A feasibility study recommended that participation should be voluntary, that mediation should be confidential, that cases should be selected on the basis of their suitability for mediation, that mediation should be conducted by suitably trained and accredited mediators and that there should be on-going evaluation of the mediation process. </PARA>
<PARA>A pilot program was introduced in September 1991 and has been extensively evaluated. The result of the evaluation is that the Tribunal has extended the scope of the program. Further extension of the program is expected following further evaluation. </PARA>
<PARA>In mediation, a neutral third person assists the parties to arrive at their own solution to their dispute. The essence of mediation is that the parties are empowered to produce the result that is best suited to their own circumstances. In the Tribunal, mediation provides an efficient and cost effective method for the resolution of many disputes. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government supports the availability of a greater choice of methods of dispute resolution and to this end has already provided the legislative framework for mediation and arbitration to be provided in the Federal Court and in the Family Court. The Courts (Mediation and Arbitration) Act 1991 amended the Family Law Act 1975 and the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 to provide a framework for those courts to develop alternative forms of dispute resolution, in particular mediation and arbitration. The Act amended the Family Law Act and the Federal Court Act to allow those courts to refer suitable matters to mediation and arbitration and to make rules of court defining the procedure to be followed. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill provides a similar legislative framework to facilitate the use of mediation in the Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA>The Tribunal actively encourages the use of mediation. However, it recognises that not all cases are suitable for mediation, such as those where the matter in dispute is of sufficient public importance for a decision to be made by the Tribunal on the merits of the case, or where there is a degree of animosity between the parties which would inhibit the mediation process. The Tribunal has developed procedures to ensure that only suitable matters are referred for mediation. Mediations are conducted only by members or staff who have been accredited as mediators. </PARA>
<PARA>The Tribunal has made extensive use of the telephone for hearings, parts of hearings and for conferences. Clause 15 of the Bill will insert section 35A which expressly provides that the Tribunal may allow a person to participate in proceedings by telephone, closed circuit television and any other means of communication. This provision will also allow persons to participate by means of video conference. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 18 of the Bill will amend section 42A to expand the Tribunal's powers to dismiss applications. The new powers to dismiss matters include the power to dismiss matters for delay in pursuing the application, where there is no reviewable decision, and for failure to appear at a directions hearing or mediation. Section 42A will also expressly provide where a matter has been dismissed the applicant may apply for a reinstatement. </PARA>
<PARA>At present there is no power for the Tribunal to dismiss an application that is frivolous or vexatious. Such matters, although few in number, are very resource intensive and divert resources away from legitimate applications. The new dismissal powers will also include the power to dismiss an application which is frivolous or vexatious. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The statement read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report I have just tabled follows an inquiry which actively occupied the Committee for about twelve months. It is the result of a reference supported by a majority in the Senate for reasons set out at the beginning of the report. There had been significant problems and controversies within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in recent years and some senators wished to satisfy themselves that necessary corrective action had been taken. They felt that the normal Senate procedures for the scrutiny of estimates and annual reports did not provide sufficient opportunity to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The inquiry therefore was essentially reactive. The Committee provided opportunities for critics of DFAT, both internal and external, to put their cases and for the Department to respond. As a result, this document does not purport to be a complete review of the management and operations of the Department. Rather, it describes the Committee's review of and conclusions on the particular matters raised with it by various interested parties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wish to stress that, wherever possible, the Committee sought empirical evidence on the issues raised with it rather than opinions, anecdotes or gossip. In many cases the criticisms of the Department's performance shrank in scope and significance when confronted with that approach.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The general conclusion to the report, which the Deputy Chair of the Committee, Senator Watson, and I prepared jointly late last week, points to three broad themes in the Committee's conclusions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first is that there has been extensive and rapid change in DFAT in recent years. This is clearly part of the explanation for the apparently high level of complaints and disputation during that period. Aspects of DFAT's management of change can be criticised. Many of the Committee's specific criticisms are of this type. But it is clear that the changes have been large and rapid and DFAT must be given credit for the progress it has made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second broad theme of the report is that the changes should not be reversed. The Committee concluded that, as well as facing the effects of the major general public service changes of recent years, DFAT has also moved from a reliance on personal relationships in many of its management systems towards more formal managerial systems. The former Secretary to the Department, Richard Woolcott, told the Committee that the Department he had joined in 1950 had been more like an extended family than a department of state. It was clear to the Committee that the paternalistic management style of the old Department of Foreign Affairs still has its supporters. It was equally clear that the day for that management style has passed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The third broad theme of the report is that the most serious faults that DFAT's critics were able to expose to this independent external review were relatively minor. The Committee's recommendations relate mainly to housekeeping matters. Its criticisms of DFAT do not go to any major aspect of the department's management and operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is true that further publicity was given to past failings, including some from the recent past. Other failings were exposed for the first time but many of these also had occurred under management systems which have since been reformed. Evidence of current or continuing problems was less prominent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee noted that the incidence of management failure in DFAT described in the report should remind the Department not to be complacent. DFAT should continue to make rigorous efforts to improve its administration and should be continually alert to areas of potential regression or management failure. Nevertheless, the report should not be interpreted as being severely critical of DFAT.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are thirty-three specific recommendations in the report. Many, as I have already noted, relate to minor administrative matters. However, I will comment briefly on some of the more significant recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee devoted a considerable amount of time and effort to investigating a large number of claims made by a small group of former and current officers of DFAT who called themselves the DFAT Reform Group. Many of these claims had been made previously and investigated by DFAT, the Auditor-General and the Australian Federal Police. As had been the case in the previous investigations, the Committee found little of substance in the Reform Group claims and has recommended that no Commonwealth investigative or administrative review agency inquire into any further allegations from this source unless and until substantive evidence is provided to support the allegations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee heard extensive argument about what has clearly been an unhappy amalgamation of the former Promotion Australia into the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The Committee concluded that much of the problem stems from a lack of clarity in the objectives in Australia's overseas public relations activities. The Committee has recommended that the objectives be clarified and that, if the Government decides to retain a specialist public relations capacity within DFAT, it do so in such a way as to maintain a viable core of specialisation within a single branch.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The difficulties sometimes associated with overseas service were brought home to the Committee by several graphic examples. The report contains a recommendation that DFAT consolidate its staff welfare initiatives into a separate sub-program directly answerable to the appropriate Deputy Secretary position.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many of the Committee's recommendations and a large part of the report are related to conditions of service issues. One important recommendation in this area is a proposal that responsibility for the setting and administration of overseas conditions of service be transferred from the Department of Industrial Relations to an independent body within the Industrial Relations portfolio but comprising members drawn from the overseas operating agencies, the Department of Finance and the Department of Industrial Relations. This should have the effect of removing some delays in the consideration of conditions of service issues, especially those relating to individual cases, and of incorporating a greater degree of first hand experience of overseas service in the decision-making process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has also recommended that the Government expedite consideration of and action on a range of specific measures to alleviate the real and increasing problems faced by foreign service spouses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee noted that DFAT has made recent improvements to its system of administering representation funding. The Committee has recommended that the possibility of further reforms be reviewed jointly by DFAT and the Department of Finance. The aim should be to replace as large a proportion as possible of the present representation advances with direct payments or with reimbursement of expenses as they occur.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The opportunity to profit through the purchase of cars free of duty has led to some notable scandals in Australia's diplomatic service. The Committee has recommended that Australian Government officers and their dependants overseas be prevented from purchasing cars duty-free but be permitted to lease cars from the Australian Government or to have access to government cars for private use subject to a contribution towards the cost of that use.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recent developments in DFAT have highlighted anomalies in the public service disciplinary provisions as they apply to heads of mission. The Committee has recommended that the Public Service Act be amended to ensure that the standard public service disciplinary procedures apply to heads of diplomatic missions and posts. The Committee has also recommended that public service disciplinary proceedings be public at least to the extent of the fact that charges have been laid, their nature and the outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has acknowledged the additional workload that this inquiry has placed on DFAT. However, it believes that the inquiry acted as a catalyst for the reaching of satisfactory outcomes to some issues facing the Department and brought other matters of concern to light. Other issues placed on the agenda by the recommendations in the report are also worthy of attention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would be unfortunate if the cumulative effect of descriptions of minor faults that make up a large part of the report were to produce an excessively adverse impression. The Committee in fact received laudatory comments on DFAT from many organisations that deal with the Department and received no complaints about the efficiency, effectiveness and integrity of most areas of its operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In previous reports, the Committee has commented favourably on the general high standard of the Australian Public service. Nothing that it has seen of the management and operations of DFAT in this inquiry has caused it to doubt the general validity of that position.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>Beef cattle feedlots are one of the fastest growing of all agricultural industries. The industry represents a significant value adding process for livestock, and in 1992 gross value of production is estimated at over $800m, with 70 per cent of production destined for overseas markets. The industry makes a notable contribution to Australia's export performance and there is also strong evidence indicating that feedlots confer economic benefits on other Australian industries, particularly the grains industry, and to rural and regional affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This industry, however, cannot be assessed merely on its economic contribution. Feedlots are intensive production systems involving as many as 30,000 head of cattle confined in pens and fed a grain based diet for 70 to 300 days. As intensive animal production systems, feedlots have the potential to cause significant environmental and animal welfare problems; and it is on this basis that the Committee considers that feedlots must be properly regulated, ecologically sustainable, and sensitive and responsive to Committee concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report that I have just tabled contains 27 recommendations or major conclusions on how these objectives might be achieved. They cover the regulations and controls relating to the establishment and management of feedlots, their economic, social and environmental impact, and implications for animal welfare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today I would like to address five major issues raised in the report. First, it should be recognised that feedlotting is a relatively new practice in Australia and one that is growing. In 1984, there were about 24,000 cattle in feedlots. In May 1992, there were approximately 325,000 cattle in feedlots with capacities greater than 500 head. It has been estimated that half as many cattle again were in smaller feedlots, including opportunity feedlots. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of this rapid growth, the Committee was told that the Commonwealth, State and local government authorities have been left behind in their role of developing appropriate laws and regulations for feedlots. The Committee is pleased to note that recently Commonwealth and State governments have  begun to address this problem by the development and the publication of the national guidelines for beef cattle feedlots in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The guidelines provide a framework in which State and Territory governments can develop detailed legislative arrangements for the control of feedlots, thereby safeguarding their environment, the local and wider community and the welfare of the animals themselves. The Committee encourages State and Territory governments to introduce proper controls for the establishment and the management of feedlots. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In reviewing the current situation, the Committee found that some States had developed comprehensive controls that are contained in specific legislation which provides a clear and consistent framework in which the industry should operate. In other States, a one-stop shop has not been developed and six or seven State government departments and five or more Acts of Parliament may be relevant to the establishment and operation of a feedlot. Given that the feedlot industry is expanding, the Committee reached the conclusion that the States should develop specific and comprehensive legislation for those feedlots. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter I wish to address also relates to differing approaches between the States to feedlots. During the inquiry the Committee heard that in New South Wales regulations governing feedlots apply to operations of 400 head or more, while in Queensland the figure is 50 head; and in the other States no capacity limit is applied. The Committee considers that this lack of uniformity is unsatisfactory and that a uniform definition based on 50 head or more should be adopted by all States and Territories. This approach would not only achieve consistency but also extend control to smaller feedlots. This is important, as the Committee was told that the cumulative effect of many small scale feedlots that are unregulated could be much greater than that of some large scale feedlots that are well regulated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third matter I wish to raise relates to the environment. When it is realised that one 450-kilogram steer produces about 29 kilograms of wet manure and urine per day, the potential for feedlots, small or large, to have an adverse environmental effect becomes apparent. In this regard, the Committee notes a recent report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">An investigation of nutrient pollution in the Murray-Darling Basin river system</EMPHASIS>, which found that nutrient balances in the basin river system provided no obvious indication of any substantial pollution from feedlots. However, the Committee also notes that the report recognised that this finding was based on very limited and inconclusive data. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee received several submissions raising concerns about the welfare of animals in feedlots. For example, the Australian and New Zealand Federation of Animal Societies told the Committee that its feedlots are unnatural, the close confinement of cattle results in physical and behavioural problems and they should be banned. The RSPCA Australia does not object to feedlots, but is opposed to the confinement of animals in circumstances that unreasonably restrict their movements and normal behavioural patterns. The Society is adamant that beef cattle feedlots should be thoroughly regulated and licensed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee rejects the view that feedlots should be prohibited and recognises them as a legitimate husbandry tool. This conclusion, however, is qualified by the need for high standards to be applied to all facets of feedlot operations in order to ensure the health and welfare of cattle. In response to the need for these high standards, the Committee's report addresses and makes recommendations on several issues including heat stress, the provision of shade and shelter, the use of chicken litter as feed, the size of pens and veterinary supervision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, throughout this report the Committee recognises that the proper siting and management of feedlots is fundamental, not only to the long term success of the industry but also to the public's confidence in the industry. The Committee's report acknowledges that the industry is making its concerted effort to improve the industry's standing and standards by its participation in the formulation of the national guidelines and its support for Ausmeat feedlot accreditation schemes. The Committee supports these initiatives but is of the view that the credibility of this industry would be enhanced if every feedlot proved itself to be a responsible corporate citizen in the management of a human food resource and the environment. I commend the Committee's report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Deputy Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs, I would like to say that I believe this report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Beef cattle feedlots in Australia</EMPHASIS>, is an impressive and authoritative document because it is very timely in its delivery. I think it is solid in its content and I think it is commendable for the speed with which our Committee has produced it. It is just over 12 months ago that we got the reference for this inquiry, and we have had some 89 public hearings, 44 witnesses and various inspections. A lot of the credit for the speed and thoroughness of this inquiry must go to the secretariat staff, who would have been amongst the busiest in this Parliament, if not the busiest. This year we have had something in the order of 92 meetings and we have held inquiries in just about every State, including sitting on weekends which we did the weekend before last in Victoria.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Federal Government uses the report, it should and can provide a cohesive blueprint for any industry like the feedlot industry that is essential for the future prosperity of our rural industries and commodities. We accept that it is difficult to provide national guidelines given the varying climate and geographic variances, however, it can provide a more comprehensive approach to the feedlot industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The value of feedlots cannot be disputed. That has already been mentioned by the Chairman of the Committee and that has to be taken into consideration when examining the industry. The industry, of course, is a significant value adding process for livestock. It had a gross value of production in 1992 estimated at $800m, with over 70 per cent of that production destined for overseas markets. I am quite sure even the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Button, would agree that that overseas income is very necessary and would be welcomed in the budget of any country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, being mindful of the terms of reference, we also examined critically the environmental and animal welfare aspects of the industry. The terms of reference specified that the Committee inquire into the regulations and controls relating to the establishment and management of feedlots; the economic, social and environmental impact of feedlots; and the implications for animal welfare. I believe that we achieved a lot in those areas. In moving through the recommendations briefly, I should highlight some of the more significant ones. It is important to realise the extent of the feedlot industry in its rapid development since it began in the early 1970s. I think that a little of the criticism of the feedlot industry has been due to the fact that some of the feedlots that were set up many years ago do not quite have the standards that are required for feedlots being built at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Grain feeding of beef started at that stage during a major drought. It was really a backstop feedlot industry that started off here in Australia. But the capacity of our feedlots and the turn-off from our feedlots have grown dramatically from 200,000 head in 1975 to a current annual turn-off of 700,000 to 800,000 and a predicted turn-off in 1995 of something like 1.1 million cattle. It should be remembered that 70 per cent of those cattle are being exported, and that is very important if we want to keep the industry running in a proper and efficient manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the size of the industry and its rapid growth, national guidelines need to be established. They are more a framework for the industry, but I think some witnesses expressed the view that they needed legislative teeth. Our view on this matter and our recommendations were that the national guidelines for beef cattle feedlots in Australia should provide a useful framework against which State and Territory governments can operate and develop detailed legislative and administrative arrangements. We considered that the proper siting and sound management of feedlots were fundamental in achieving a responsible feedlot industry. I think that is well understood by people in the industry at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people were concerned about what happens with the amount of foreign investment in the Australian industry. We noted the concerns of the Cattle Council of Australia about the increase in the investment threshold from $3m to $50m and associated monitoring procedures of the Foreign Investment Review Board. We said that we welcome the advice of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy that, as well as commenting on foreign investment proposals of over $50m, the Department is also notified of proposals over $3m to enable it to monitor the level of foreign investment in the meat and livestock industry and in the individual enterprises. That being the case, it does keep some control. As you know, Mr Acting Deputy President, being the Chairman of the Committee, that was an area of concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, in that area, the problem for a lot of people was getting the markets at the other end, and some of the foreign investment did help in getting those markets. That is something that needs to be looked at in the future. I think that Australia needs to get out and trade a bit more on its own. If it can do so, that will be of benefit to Australia as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as management and training are concerned, we believe that the larger feedlots were definitely professionally managed. Their level of husbandry and stockmanship was of an excellent standard. I think it would pass the utmost scrutiny of anyone with reservations about the industry. They have to have good management and good husbandry to be successful. I do not think that the same could be said for all the smaller feedlots, some of which were set up many years ago. They will continue to be a source of concern while they are outside regulatory control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were a lot of differing views concerning shade, and we commend the people who are doing trials on shade. The behavioural problems of beef cattle in feedlots and problems associated with excessive heat in Queensland areas really need to be looked at, and will be looked at in the future. The Chairman of the Committee has already mentioned environmental aspects. There are a lot of liquid wastes from feedlots, including urine, wash waters and run-off during rainfall, et cetera, and that is an area that has to be looked at. But properly sited and properly run feedlots are something that Australia needs. They will be of great benefit to Australian primary industries in the future and for our export income. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having been a member of the former committee on animal welfare, I have never ceased to be amazed by the dogged determination of these animal liberationists. In this particular case we had reports given to us about why they were against lot feeding. We would pick up the paper the next day and see they were against intensive piggeries. The next day one would see that they were against intensive poultry production. In fact, they were against just about anything to do with animal husbandry in this country. We have to try to get a balance in Australia about our livestock production. In this inquiry plenty of evidence was given to us about the importance of beef production and, in particular, the huge increase in the amount of export beef through the lot feeding systems in Australia and the amount of money they bring in as valuable foreign exchange. So we have to keep things in perspective. This particular report strikes a very good balance, and the recommendations and guidelines strike a very important balance between industry expectations, the environment and animal welfare problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a recent inquiry we were looking at youth unemployment. I have to say that some of the conditions and some of the pressures on young people are far greater than those on some of the cattle we saw in lot feeding. At least the cattle and pigs have a guaranteed amount of feed every day, which is more than can be said for some of the young unemployed people, people who are out of work and homeless youth around Australia. Perhaps members of the animal liberation movement could divert their attention to spending their energies on looking after some of the less advantaged of the human species in our nation at present. We can do without some of the extravagances of the radical animal liberation movement in Australia. I think we have to be a little more practical. It is a very comprehensive report and I commend all those who were involved with it. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report, I think, is a very important document in pulling together a value added component of an industry which is going to grow significantly in Australia over the next few years. Not only will it be a model in pulling together the information for beef cattle feedlots; it also has an enormous amount of information, in terms of livestock in general, which will set, if you like, the principles for guidelines that are required for an industry such as this. We have also seen that the product that comes from feedlots is significantly more valuable to the Australian community than cattle that are run on grass and farmed in the traditional manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not going to go into a lot of the detail of the report, because that is there for everybody to read, but I would just like to refer to page 15. One of the conclusions there says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the basis of evidence presented during the inquiry, the Committee considers that the beef cattle feedlot sector is a growing and increasingly important part of the Australian beef industry.</PARA>
<PARA>It then goes into estimates of the value, and the fact that 70 per cent of production is destined for overseas markets. Of course, in our current position with our current account deficit, that is very important. I think this report should give encouragement not only to those people involved in the beef industry but also to other industries that are looking at going at least into first stage value adding. That is the real significance and importance of this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point that I would like to make concerns the animal welfare situation and how cattle, in particular, handle feedlots. Of course, that extends into other livestock as well. There has been much criticism but, provided the feedlots are up to the required standards, and given the choice, the animals themselves will always come to the troughs and eat the feed that is placed in them by whoever is running the feedlot. I saw that happen myself during the drought which we experienced a couple of years ago. We were feeding stock not for the purpose of on-selling them, but just for survival. But it is notable that even now, in very good seasonal conditions, those same stock, given the opportunity, will always get their feed from the feedlot troughs. A lot of propaganda has been put around about so-called stress on animals in these particular situations but, once that feed is put in the trough, the animals make a choice to walk out of a green paddock, with grass up to their knees, and eat what is provided to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those are my comments at this stage on this report. I will just conclude by saying&mdash;as I said in my opening remarks&mdash;that this is a very important report in terms of setting the direction of, and pulling together the details we were able to collect for, that industry; and it will be beneficial, I believe, across the board for all value adding industries, particularly those in the first stages. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, would like to endorse the comments that have been made about the level of work and the capacity of the staff of the secretariat of the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs. In carrying out the huge workload that was given to this Committee, the staff have been thoroughly competent in delivering a professional result.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a member of the Committee I made some visits. I was not able to participate in all of the visits which took place, but in attending most of the visits which were conducted I was impressed by the professional attitude and the desire of the operators of some of the best feedlots to make their enterprise as effective and as efficient as possible. Regard was paid to the effect of the enterprise on the animals concerned, also to ensure that the effect on the surrounding countryside was as benign as possible. That applied to some operations, but we also observed some which could not be described in the preceding terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the terms of reference of the Committee, animal welfare considerations are instinctively brought into it because the arrangement by which the animals are kept cannot be described as a natural state of affairs. Instinctively, we ask if this is a desirable state of affairs, and that is where the difficulties begin. It is very difficult to assess an animal's appreciation of its status. It is impossible to deliver a questionnaire to the animals concerned. Although mention has been made already of a psychological analysis, it is pretty formidable to conduct a psychological analysis of the state of welfare of an animal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may appear that animals are not under stress if they are provided with feed and shade and reasonably comfortable conditions, but we know little of the opportunity of animals to follow their natural instincts when they are kept in conditions which are not natural. For example, the homogeneity of the age, and even the size, of the animals leads one to believe that the natural herding instincts of the cattle could not be pursued. The hierarchies of herds, the natural rhythm occurring in cattle herds, could not be applied there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the question is: is any of this relevant? In measuring the actual health status of animals the Australian Veterinary Association, as stated in our report, considers that there are no veterinary or ethical problems associated with cattle being in reasonably close proximity in feedlots. Whatever parameters are used to consider whether the animal is in good health, whether it is diseased, whether it is short of feed or being fed the wrong food, those measurements can readily be made. But other measurements which may be necessary in the consideration of the full welfare of an animal cannot be made. The question of whether it is good for the animal's welfare is a question which is almost impossible to address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not so with the question of the environmental impact of cattle feedlots. The intensive nature of such enterprises means that the effect is also intensive. That effect can be a huge and concentrated discharge of nutrients into our drainage systems. That effect can be direct pollution of the land or the water nearby. There can also be offensive smells generated, and all sorts of other offences. But it need not be so in a well planned and well administered feedlot. It is possible to arrange the drainage so that settling ponds and sedimentation are well catered for before there is any discharge into our drainage systems. It is possible to arrange drainage for the balance of water so that offensive smells are not generated. It is also possible regularly to clean and remove any surplus material from the site to a composting area where it is not generating offensive material. Whether that is done is another matter. The Committee found that in some instances the management of a site was such that there was little likelihood of pollutant material escaping. In other cases it was obvious that polluting material did escape the site and it had a huge effect on the surrounding countryside. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has rightly been said earlier, the adoption of the national guidelines, which have already been prepared, will reduce the number of offensive sites, but the lack of coordination between national, State and local government means that this may take a lot longer than is desirable. I think that one of the most important things the Committee discovered was that the huge growth of the industry has meant that the regulating bodies are behind in being able to regulate the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am in a difficult situation. Instinctively, I feel that there is a lot wrong with herding cattle together in such a fashion. Most of my direct questions have been answered by the evidence we have collected, yet I still feel that it is not the right way to generate a profit. I agree that this is an industry that does generate considerable international monetary benefit for Australia, but there are lots of things that can be done to earn money and not all of them are right. Instinctively, I do not feel that this is right, even though the operators are doing their best to consider the welfare, as they determine it, of the animals involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The operators are doing their best not to have an adverse effect on the surrounding countryside, but I still feel that there is something wrong about it. Even though I am particularly partial to a decent steak, I would like to feel that my steak came from a well-fed angus standing in natural countryside. The cattle that are used in these sorts of enterprises may be contentedly standing about with expressions on their faces that we could interpret as meaning that they are not under stress but, instinctively, I do not feel that is so. However, we have in front of us a report that has attempted to address those problems. We have a report that has comprehensively examined the range of feedlots in Australia, and we have to acknowledge that attempts have been made. I endorse the report as it is. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA>When this matter was discussed during the debate on the second reading of the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) pointed out that the reduction in employment and the high rate of bankruptcy in the TCF industries occurred some two or three years ago when the reduction in tariffs had only just begun and when the quantitative restrictions were still in place. That may be true, but people running businesses do anticipate the economic climate that they will have to face and, rather than wait to be made bankrupt, they make other arrangements. They move offshore&mdash;in other words, they export jobs&mdash;or they simply go out of business; they do not wait to be bankrupted by the Government's tariff reduction program. It is much more relevant to look&mdash;and I have put that on record before, too&mdash;at what is happening to the TCF industries. An industry which employed 120,000 people is now down to 76,000 in March 1992, and it anticipates that it will be down to 55,000 employees and probably fewer when the provisions of this Bill actually take effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me restate what this Bill proposes to do. It will remove all quantitative restrictions on TCF products, as well as putting in place the tariff reduction program that the Government has enunciated. It is the considered view of the industry that it will decimate what is left of that industry. I know that it has been argued that we cannot continue to make T-shirts when Chinese factories are able to pay less than $20 for a 48-hour week and when they do not have to cope with the sorts of environmental constraints, social constraints and work safety constraints that we impose on our manufacturers. The question arises: are we prepared to sink to their levels and are we prepared to throw on the scrap heap those people who are now currently in the industry?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister cited the TCF Development Authority report in glowing terms, and I agree with him that a lot of worthwhile work is being done. However, there is no evidence that the people who are being retrenched in this industry are able to find alternative employment. The point was made by Mr Alan Trumble, the President of the TCF Council, that the majority of people working in the industry&mdash;and this is self-evident&mdash;are essentially semi-skilled, even unskilled, and very often have a poor command of English. It is, therefore, difficult for them to find other employment. We as a community have a choice: are we prepared to continue to pay a slightly higher price for TCF products that we purchase, or are we going to raise higher taxes to pay more unemployment benefits to pay people to do nothing, with all the destructive social consequences that this brings?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Trumble also made a very telling point. He said that a lot of his work force and the work force of other people in other enterprises in the industry consist of migrants that have been brought to this country to do jobs that we Australians were not prepared to do, and are we now going to say to them, `You have done your job, we do not want you any more, we will throw you on the scrap heap'? It is for these reasons that I have moved these requested amendments, which will remove those provisions of the Bill which totally remove all quantitative restraints and which institute the tariff cutting program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should also stress&mdash;and it has been misrepresented to some extent by Senator Ferguson, speaking for the Opposition, and by the Minister&mdash;that we are not suggesting that we should have high tariff walls around Australia forever after. We appreciate that the industry must restructure, and that in time we must reduce manufacturing of products that can be done much more economically in other countries. What we are quarrelling with is the speed. What we are quarrelling with is the fact that it coincides with the current recession, which is deepening the economic problems of the industry and which is deepening the misery of the people concerned with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is a extremely insensitive step for the Government to implement at this point of time; and at this stage one might say that the only hope appears to be Dr Hewson, who on Friday is possibly going to reconsider the coalition's position on tariffs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition does not support the requested amendments put forward by Senator Spindler&mdash;but not because we do not have sympathy with the need for people to have occupations and so on. As the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) knows, I have had a very long and close association with the clothing, textile and footwear industries ever since I have been in this place, and I also know and respect Mr Trumble very much. But the plan is in progress and everybody understands where we are at. The comments of Senator Spindler do not take into account the fact that there are many successful businesses, as well as unsuccessful ones. They do not take into account the fact that the firms that have changed most have improved most and that there is still room for improvement in many areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was somewhat surprised yesterday to receive a copy of the book put out by the Bonds company, in which Mr George Innes, whom I respect very greatly, quoted at great length a speech that I made in the Senate only a couple of years ago on the costs involved with industry in these areas, and the disadvantages that we suffer compared to some other countries. What it very much indicates is that we still have to get on with micro-economic change. We must get on and remove the obstacles that make it difficult. It is not just a matter of tariffs; it is not just a matter of the value of our currency; it is the whole package. What I refer to as the Spindler theory of certain demise cannot take over at this stage, because it will not produce the result that we all want to see: that is, a strong, vibrant and modern clothing, textile and footwear industry. We still can do this, but it is going to require to be brought forward, not by the textile industry and others on their own, but as part of an Australia wide package. All these businesses will then prosper and the people of Australia will prosper. But they will not prosper while ever we are fiddling around the edges trying to make exceptions. In this particular instance, the Opposition will not be supporting the amendment. </PARA>

Since this sharp drop, employment has continued to decline but at a much slower rate of just over 2 per cent. Now there are not many other industries which can point to those sorts of figures. I draw the attention of the honourable senator&mdash;as I have on numerous occasions&mdash;to the relatively low import ratio and the low export ratio of TCF products, compared with other industries. That is what restructuring in these industries is all about. I may sound brutal, but these arguments are always about these industries employing people who cannot get jobs in other industries because they are migrants, or because they are women. That is a terrible denigration of people who work in these industries.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is a question of recovery in the Australian economy which will produce jobs. Senator Spindler keeps relying on Mr Alan Trumble, who has been the spokesman for these industries. In his own firm, Mr Alan Trumble is making investments, changing the product range he produces and employing more people.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Corporate law reform has not been handled well in recent years. Since 1989 we have been faced with a series of Bills, all of them complex, most of them long, attempting to enact a national scheme of corporate regulation. We passed the Corporations Bill 1989, which contained almost 1,000 pages, and then the 300-page Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill, which was subsequently necessary when large parts of the former Act were found to be unconstitutional. The Bill implementing the Corporations Law was debated in the House of Representatives less than a week after its introduction in November 1990, with the guillotine allowing only 60 minutes of debate in total. It was then also guillotined through the Senate, with only an hour of debate after the second reading.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Corporations Law has since been amended by the Corporations Legislation Amendment Act 1991, which was debated within a week of its introduction in 1991, with 40 minutes being allowed for debate. This was followed by the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991, which was guillotined after only 45 minutes of debate. The Corporations (Unlisted Property Trusts) Amendment Bill 1991 got just three minutes, and the Corporations Legislation (Evidence) Amendment Bill 1992 was also passed. Now we have another piece of legislation, a further 216 pages of so-called finetuning, and already the Corporate Law Reform Bill (No. 2) 1992 is on the table. So what we have had is a series of enormous Bills, debated inadequately under ridiculous time constraints, producing a highly complex and uncertain regulatory environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Corporate Law Reform Bill was introduced into the House of Representatives last month and debated just one week later. The debate was guillotined again. This Bill also was dealt with for only 40 minutes in the House of Representatives. Only 40 minutes of debate were allowed for what was described by the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) as `the most significant piece of legislation, in terms of Australia's corporate law, introduced in the life of this Parliament'. Under the time constraints that we have here today, it will not receive proper scrutiny in the Senate either. So the picture I paint in introducing the coalition's reaction to this legislation is one that is highly critical of the process of legislation in corporate law under this Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill amends the Corporations Law and certain other legislation with respect to duties of officers of corporations, financial benefits to related parties of public companies, external administration of companies and the implementation of the clearing house subregister system. The amendments come about as a result of several reviews of the operations of the Corporations Law, notably the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on the social and fiduciary duties and obligations of company directors&mdash;something to which I contributed some years ago; the Law Reform Commission's Report No. 45 on insolvency, otherwise known as the Harmer report; and the report on corporate financial transactions by the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee. It is a pity that after so much work through committee processes legislation receives so little proper scrutiny in the legislative chambers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me deal firstly, however, with the director's duties part of the legislation. These amendments pick up some of the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee I just mentioned. The duty of care currently required of company officers is, of course, set out in section 232(4) of the Corporations Law. It is an objective duty requiring an officer to exercise the degree of care and diligence that a reasonable person with that person's skills and knowledge would exercise.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the exposure draft of this Bill was released by the Attorney-General in February this year, it was proposed that that section be amended to provide a list of factors which a court would be required to take into account in determining whether a director had fulfilled his or her duties. The coalition and the business community strenuously objected to this approach, particularly in three respects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, the objective standard of care to be imposed related to a director's knowledge, experience and competence. It was implied that a judge would not have to consider an individual director's circumstances when deciding whether he or she had fulfilled their duty of care. Effectively, this was an attempt to impose the same standard of skill for every director of every one of Australia's companies, which we regarded as a ludicrous proposal. The board should obviously comprise people with a range of skills and experience, and the level of skill required by a director of a major company may not be that which is required of a very small company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the listing of factors relevant to breach of duty really did not clarify what the content of the duty of care was supposed to be. Arguably, the list imposed substantive new duties on directors. There would have been pressure on directors to cover themselves with respect to every item on the checklist, which may well have distracted them from their duties as directors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, and most importantly, the proposed amendment did not introduce a business judgment rule; a proposal concerning which the coalition's enthusiastic report is shared by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and the Companies and Securities Law Review Committee. A business judgment rule, as developed in the United States, provides protection from prosecution for directors who make business judgments in good faith and with no personal interest in the transaction, and who have ensured that they are adequately informed about the subject of the decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition welcomes the Minister's decision&mdash;as a result of comments received on the exposure draft of the Bill&mdash;to abandon the proposals for a checklist of factors and an objective standard of skill. The Bill as presently before us proposes instead to reword subsection 232(4) in order to confirm the present position, which is that a director is required to exercise the degree of care that a reasonable person would exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The explanatory memorandum does state that it is up to the courts to develop an Australian equivalent of the business judgment rule; however, the coalition would have preferred that this Bill also introduce a statutory business judgment rule. The advantage of such a rule is that it provides certainty for directors. Corporate law should encourage, and afford broad protection to, informed business judgments in order to stimulate risk taking and innovation and to give directors the confidence to make commercial decisions on their true merits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move to the second part relating to civil penalty provisions. In relation to breaches of directors' duties, the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs recommended that criminal liability only apply where conduct is genuinely criminal in nature, and not where conduct is negligent. This Bill picks up that recommendation and decriminalises certain key directors' duties provisions including the duty to act honestly in subsection 232(2), the duty of care and diligence in subsection 232(4), and the duty not to make improper use of inside information in subsection 232(5). Breaches of these provisions will not attract criminal penalties unless they are committed with fraudulent or dishonest intent. Where a person contravenes one of these provisions a court will have the power to make a civil penalty order prohibiting the person from managing a corporation for a specified period, or to impose a pecuniary penalty of not more than $200,000, or both. It will usually be up to the Australian Securities Commission to make application for a civil penalty order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is supporting these provisions because it believes that criminality should not attach to breaches of the law that involve no criminal intent. However, we do have concerns about the complexity of these provisions, particularly those that allow a court to bring a civil penalty finding as an alternative verdict when criminal proceedings have been commenced. It will be interesting to see the impact of the introduction of these civil penalty provisions on the recent dispute between the Australian Securities Commission and the Director of Public Prosecutions about their respective roles and responsibilities in the prosecution of corporate crime. The DPP, Mr Rozenes, expressed his concerns to the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Corporations and Securities on 7 September. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the ASC will not devote sufficient resources to the identification, investigation and prosecution of corporate crime.</PARA>
<PARA>He also said that the DPP is not confident that all matters appropriate for prosecution as offences under the Corporations Law are being referred to it by the ASC. Last year, the corporate prosecutions budget of the DPP was significantly underspent by $1.5m, or 20 per cent of its total budget. Mr Rozenes said that the DPP was expecting far more work in the corporate area than it had received. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Hartnell, during his time as head of the ASC, has been responsible for the ASC's change in emphasis to a commercial regulatory approach, relying on civil penalties instead of deterring corporate misconduct by punishment. Mr Hartnell has admitted that only three cases have been referred to the DPP in the 18 months since the new Corporations Law came into force. The DPP strongly objects to this allocation of resources to regulatory functions rather than criminal prosecutions. It sees this as a refusal of the ASC to play the role of corporate policeman, leaving a potentially serious gap in Australian regulation. The ASC is generally critical of the delays caused by the DPP in pursuing criminal prosecutions. The DPP, in turn, is critical of the standard of the briefs prepared by the ASC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a situation where the Commonwealth's senior prosecutor has lost faith in the Commonwealth's commercial regulator. Yet it was not until the matter had been exposed by the media, as a result of a leak of correspondence between Mr Hartnell and Mr Rozenes, that the Attorney-General was forced to take an interest in the matter. We trust that these new provisions allowing for civil penalty orders will ameliorate the relationship between the ASC and the DPP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the third of the important parts of this Bill, which concerns related party transactions. The coalition also has serious concerns about the provisions of the Bill which deal with such transactions. These amendments are being made in response to the corporate excesses of the 1980s, with the aim of preventing public companies from giving financial benefits to related parties, except in certain specified circumstances. In relation to those well known corporate failures, it is interesting to pursue the matter of the progress of the ASC into investigating what has become known as the big 16 cases. The ASC's expenditure on investigations into the so-called big 16 cases to 30 June 1992 was $4.7m. Mr Robinson of the ASC told the Senate Estimates Committee this year that 40 per cent of the ASC's total investigative resources have gone into those cases, and a significant number of them have been referred to the DPP. After several years of investigation and the expenditure of $4.7m there have, however, been convictions in relation to only two matters, Rothwells and Estate Mortgage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we appreciate that there are still a number of matters awaiting trial, this very slow rate of progress is a matter of great concern and it will continue to be monitored by the coalition. It is currently section 234 of the Corporations Law which deals with loans to directors. Pursuant to this Bill, section 234 will be repealed and replaced with a new part 3.2A, comprising 33 sections dealing with financial benefits to related parties of public companies. The provisions prohibit two types of related party transactions. The first prohibition is on a public company giving a financial benefit to a related party and the second is on a child entity of a public company giving a benefit to a related party of the public company. However, such transactions may proceed if they are approved by shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this area of related party transactions was examined in 1989 by the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee, known as the Burrows committee, the Committee formed the view that legislation was required to deal with loans to related and connected companies and executive and intra-group remuneration. It believed that dishonest related party transactions were the cause of many of the corporate collapses of the 1980s and that complex legislation was necessary to prevent any recurrence. The Committee's suggestions were not well received, principally because many people, including the coalition and business groups, did not consider that the proposed sweeping reforms were justified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Attorney-General released the exposure draft of this Bill in February this year, it contained 60 pages of legislation concerning related party transactions which attempted to address every possible situation that could arise. However, the Government did not put forward the justification for proposing extensive legislation nor the reason why existing laws were inadequate. Owing to the widespread criticism of these provisions in the exposure draft, the Attorney-General appointed a working party to simplify the provisions, and its proposals have been incorporated into the Bill we are now debating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the working party's changes do succeed in simplifying the provisions concerning related party transactions to some extent, the coalition is still concerned that there are deficiencies in this legislation and that there has been inadequate justification for the adoption of the extensive legislation path. Even in the explanatory memorandum it is acknowledged that dishonesty cannot be prevented by legislation and that lack of proper enforcement was a major problem with the existing legislation&mdash;the implication being that it is not new legislation that is required but proper enforcement of existing provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to our concerns about the desirability of the approach the Government has chosen, the coalition is concerned about the operation of these provisions. One of the features that concerns us is the prohibition in proposed paragraph 243G(1)(b) on an entity giving a financial benefit to a person indirectly, for example through interposed entities. This means that every transaction between unrelated parties will have to be reviewed to check whether there is any linkage higher up in the corporate chain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The broad definition of related parties in clause 243F compounds the problem. It includes directors, their spouses, parents, children and directors of certain other entities. It extends to a public company's parent entity and sibling entities. That is quaint language. The combined effect of the indirect financial benefit extension and the breadth of the related party concept will mean that public companies will need to scrutinise every proposed transaction to ensure it does not breach the prohibitions contained in clause 243H. The need for such scrutiny will add considerably to transaction costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides for a number of exemptions to the prohibitions on giving financial benefits to related parties. The so-called arm's length exemption in proposed section 243H will also create problems. It will allow a public company or a child entity to give a financial benefit on terms and conditions no more favourable to the related party than those on which it is reasonable to expect that the company would give the benefit if dealing with an unrelated party at arm's length. A transaction can therefore go ahead without the need for a shareholders meeting if it is justifiable on arm's length terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is hard to see that this will change the situation which obtained in the 1980s, which the Government is trying to rectify. More prudent companies will still tend to rely on shareholders meetings where transactions involve related parties, whereas those with more cavalier attitudes will be able to avoid shareholders meetings by finding an adviser willing to state that a transaction is as favourable as one at arm's length. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another exemption clause&mdash;clause 243Q&mdash;will also cause problems. It makes very detailed provision&mdash;albeit, thankfully, not quite as detailed as in the exposure draft&mdash;for the procedures to be followed to obtain the authorisation of shareholders to an otherwise prohibited transaction. These procedures will add considerably to business costs, particularly where a transaction between related companies is proposed for legitimate business reasons. Despite our concerns about these provisions, the coalition will not be moving to amend them at this stage because it considers that to do so would further confuse the already complex situation. However, it has also undertaken to monitor these closely when in government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second last area is that relating to insolvency reforms. I may well have to cover the last part in the committee stage because, with hundreds of pages of legislation before us, the time constraint agreed between the Democrats and the Government in this instance is simply unsatisfactory. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the Senate. On the last day of sitting the Government and the Australian Democrats are showing unusual tolerance. I want to mention insolvency reforms, and I will be brief. Part 4 of this Bill introduces amendments with respect to company insolvency as recommended by the Australian Law Reform Commission's general insolvency inquiry, the Harmer report. Pursuant to the reforms contained in this Bill, the existing provisions in the Corporations Law with respect to the official management of insolvent companies will be repealed and replaced with a new part 5.3A, to provide for a voluntary scheme of administration of insolvent companies. There are also amendments to part 5.2, which deals with the duties and obligations of receivers, and proposals for new parts 5.4, 5.4A and 5.4B, with respect to winding up insolvency. The coalition welcomes these amendments as a significant improvement of the law, although it still has some reservations. One of those concerns is with respect to the amendments in proposed part 5.7B, which make it an offence for a director to permit a company to incur further debt while insolvent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proposed section 558G will alter the circumstances in which a director may be liable where the company incurs a debt. The current situation, as set out in subsection 592(1), is that it applies where there are reasonable grounds to expect that the company will not be able to pay its debts as and when they fall due. This amendment provides that the section will apply if, at the time of incurring the debt, there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that the company is insolvent or would become insolvent. The effect of this amendment is to lower the threshold; a situation of some concern to the coalition. Company directors will be forced to resign as soon as any grounds of suspicion arise. This is a most onerous imposition on directors, particularly during this recession&mdash;the recession we had to have&mdash;when such suspicions arise easily and frequently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last part I wanted to mention very briefly is that relating to stock exchange settlement procedures. The reforms in part 5 of this Bill will enable the Australian Stock Exchange to introduce a new clearing house electronic subregister system, to be known by its acronym CHESS. This will make our Stock Exchange more competitive internationally, and by speeding up security settlements will reduce risk for investors. The new procedures will be of considerable benefit to Australian business and are therefore welcomed by the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On balance, therefore, despite our concerns with some of the provisions of this very large and complex Bill, the coalition will be supporting its passage. It recognises the vital role that legislation regulating corporate behaviour plays in the economy. That is why it has undertaken, when in government, to review the operation of corporate law in this country with the aim of making it simpler and clearer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Corporate Law Reform Bill 1992. This is a substantial Bill and, to some extent, the Australian Democrats share the concerns expressed by Senator Hill about the lack of time for debate in this chamber. Nevertheless, it must be acknowledged that a fairly substantial consultation process went on, not least through the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities which examined the exposure draft of the Bill at some length and in some detail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill obviously arises out of community concerns that, during the 1980s, so-called corporate cowboys jeopardised, not only the savings of Australian middle and low income earners with which they were entrusted, but also the commercial reputation of Australian business overseas. In the debate between Mr Rozenes, the Director of Public Prosecutions, and Mr Hartnell, the Chairman of the ASC, the Democrats firmly come down on the side of the argument that we must, as far as possible, enforce our corporate laws through prosecution. It is clear that corporate offenders, if they are simply faced with a fine, will treat that as a business expense, just like a parking fine. What we must do is ensure that corporate crooks are prosecuted just as effectively as people who shoplift in one of our stores. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill implements reforms to the Corporations Law in the areas of directors' duties, related party transactions, corporate insolvency laws and stock exchange settlement procedures. The Bill reflects the considerable influence which three major law reform reports have had on the Corporations Law. These are the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The social and fiduciary duties and obligations of company directors</EMPHASIS>, the Australian Law Reform Commission report on its general insolvency inquiry and the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee report on corporate financial transactions. In addition, there was an exhaustive consultative process undertaken with all interested parties, including corporate lawyers and business organisations, as I have already stated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regarding the area of directors' duties, the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, in its report, noted at the outset that any change in the regulation of directors' activities `must be warranted and a sensible balance must be found between measures necessary to promote corporate activity in a way which will be of benefit to all'. Clearly, the right of individual directors to exercise judgment and to take commercial risks must be balanced. The report dealt with the duties directors owe under company law to entities outside the company. In recent times the case law has imposed a duty on directors to creditors, and this was considered in chapter 5 of the report. The basis for this development is the closeness of the relationship between a company at the times of insolvency or near insolvency and its creditors. At these times, directors often will have dealt with the assets of creditors rather than the assets of company owners. The courts have decided that in those circumstances directors owe duties to creditors. In chapter 6 of the report the Committee considered the interests of entities other than the company, the shareholders and creditors, and the extent to which directors are entitled to take account of extrinsic factors in their decision making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the main duty that directors owe is clearly to the shareholders of the company, and in this sense they are the trustees of the company's activity and assets. The duty of directors in taking particular decisions in the marketplace has continually been the subject of considerable debate and legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation No. 2 of the report was that a business judgment rule be introduced into Australian company law to set the objective standard, as recommended by recommendation No. 1, for a director's duty of care. This rule is currently part of American jurisprudence, as Senator Hill has mentioned. The purpose of the rule is to provide special protection to directors who make informed business decisions, that is, directors who make a business judgment in good faith. I am not sure, however, that I agree with Senator Hill's comment that the introduction of such a rule would provide certainty. It seems to me that the rule does not remove the director's duty to act reasonably and with care, and that this would still be subject to determining a proper standard of conduct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government, in its response to that recommendation in the report, said that it was not at this stage convinced that it is appropriate to introduce in isolation this one aspect of American jurisprudence into the Australian law on director's duties. The exposure draft of the Bill, which was released in February 1992, clearly indicated that the Government had decided that this rule would not be introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The draft Bill did list a number of criteria which should be used in assessing whether a director has met the obligation which would otherwise be expressed in the business judgment rule, and the items listed include the following: information that the officer has required; the meetings that the officer has attended; how far the officer has exercised an act of discretion in the matters concerned; what the officer did to ensure that the corporation made adequate arrangements; what arrangements have been made to ensure that decisions made by one person on the corporation's behalf were, in fact, adequately monitored; and what arrangements were made to ensure that persons who have made decisions on the corporation's behalf had adequate information about the subject matter of the decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These draft provisions met with considerable opposition from corporate lawyers and business organisations before hearings of the parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities. This check list, as applied to directors, was dropped by the Government from the legislation. The Australian Democrats would actually not have objected to the check list being left in, believing that it would have set a reasonable standard for the behaviour of directors. I do not believe that the concerns expressed by corporate lawyers, and shared to a large extent by the Opposition, really would have eventuated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to see that in paragraph 83 of the explanatory memorandum the Government states that it considers that proposed subsection (4) does not change the law but merely confirms the present position. I believe that that is correct, and it is at the base of our position on this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to related party transactions. This is a key area of reform in this Bill. The attempts to reform this particular area began in 1989, when the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee produced a discussion paper dealing with loans to related and connected companies and executive and intragroup remuneration. The Advisory Committee produced in 1991 a report containing draft legislation which again elicited considerable criticism. In response to such criticisms, the Government set up a part time working party to simplify the provisions, arriving at what is now before us in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provisions in the Bill essentially prohibit the giving of a financial benefit by a public company and its child entities to a related party of the public company unless that financial benefit is given to a related party on arm's length terms or if it is disclosed to and approved by a general meeting of shareholders. The Australian Democrats welcome these amendments as an important contribution to the regulation of dishonest transactions of the type that contributed so heavily to the corporate crashes of the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the corporate insolvency provisions in the Bill. The Bill adopts most of the 1988 Harmer report recommendations on insolvency. These recommendations were based on the concern that, in some cases, corporations were being placed into receivership or liquidation because of large accumulated debts but were either trading at a profit or could do so if properly restructured. The central change in the Bill in the area of corporate insolvency is the introduction of a mechanism to enable a corporation facing insolvency to appoint an independent administrator and to be protected from bankruptcy while a scheme of arrangement is developed. In other words, it offers a breather to companies facing solvency difficulties. At the same time, creditors would also receive protection under proposed section 436E, which requires an administrator to hold, within five days of his or her appointment, an initial meeting of creditors to decide whether to appoint a committee of creditors and/or remove and replace the administrator by resolution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats welcome these amendments and regard the balance between providing a breathing space for companies facing solvency difficulties and the interests of creditors to have been properly addressed. However, on this point, we share the concerns expressed by the Opposition about the risk to the administrator of exposure to personal liability. I believe that this is an area that needs to be monitored and reviewed in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final key area of reform in the Bill relates to stock exchange settlement procedures. I advert only briefly to these amendments which will enable the Australian Stock Exchange to introduce a new clearing house electronic subregister system. The Government believes that this new system will enable Australia's stock exchange settlement procedures to continue to remain on par with the world's best and meet the standards of quick settlement that are demanded nowadays. The Australian Democrats believe that this provision is useful. We will monitor its performance and we welcome it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to delay the Senate for too long in this debate for, as Senator Spindler said, the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities has spent many days and hours reviewing the draft Corporate Law Reform Bill and taking evidence from a series of experts in the corporate law field, from business, commerce and academia. Furthermore, Senator Hill has quite thoroughly set out the Opposition's point of view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there are a couple of matters that I want to raise in this debate. The first is that the hearings we held around Australia brought up a number of themes, whether we were in Brisbane, Perth, Sydney or Melbourne, and they were that there is still an overwhelming concern amongst the business community and amongst the corporate law fraternity that this corporate law, which came into being in January 1991, is far too complex and puts on business, at a time when we are trying to get out of a deep recession, enormous compliance costs that inhibit business in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Corporate law is not a sexy issue. It is not an issue that is ever going to be on the front page of Australian newspapers, except when there are spectacular corporate collapses or spectacular blues between the Director of Public Prosecutions and the head of the Australian Securities Commission. But it is a matter that affects the daily lives of Australians, even though they may not see it that way. If Australia's corporate law and regulations are to become more complex and impose more and more costs on doing business in Australia, it will cost Australians business opportunities. It will cost us in terms of competitiveness, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, and we will see companies being reluctant to enter into enterprises in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think honourable senators from both sides of this chamber would share a strong commitment to the view that we need to see new enterprises being established in Australia. We need to ensure that the cost of doing business in Australia is not prohibitive. That, of course, relates to all areas of policy, be it taxation, broad regulations or, of course, very fundamentally, the Corporations Law. I think the Senate needs to consider the Corporations Law as part of the whole debate on regulation and the cost of doing business. We need to be very careful, when we are considering the corporate law reform process, that we are not, in the pursuit of the corporate misdemeanours of the 1980s, imposing enormous costs on the new businesses and new entrepreneurs that should emerge in the 1990s. There is a very fine balance to be reached. I commend the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities for the work that the Committee has been doing in enabling a broad range of views to come forward on these corporate law matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Hill referred in his speech to consideration of the effectiveness of the ASC both as a regulator and as an investigator of corporate misdemeanours. I share the view expressed during the debate on the DPP-ASC conflagration that took place earlier this year. We do need carefully to monitor the Australian Securities Commission's performance in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities does have before it at the moment a reference to review the performance of the Australian Securities Commission in relation to the potential for insider trading in the Jupiters Casino bid in Brisbane earlier this year&mdash;a very serious matter and the sort of matter where our Committee can have a very positive role in ensuring that the Australian Securities Commission is doing the right thing, is being sensible and does not investigate matters in a less than satisfactory manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I still have quite serious concerns about whether or not the Australian Securities Commission has sensible resourcing and, indeed, allocation of resources to its investigations areas. As I review material relating to the Jupiters Casino matter, the allocation of resources and the management of the resources within the Australian Securities Commission, particularly in relation to this sort of investigation, lead me to believe that there are serious doubts about the Australian Securities Commission's role in this concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, that is a matter that this Committee will pursue very vigorously in the coming months. Any wrongdoing in relation to the Jupiters Casino matter&mdash;the handling of it by the State Government, the matters relating to who had inside knowledge about the Jupiters Casino, the involvement by Daikyo Corporation, when Daikyo Corporation, indeed, had intended to pull out of that casino bid, and when that matter became public&mdash;will be a matter that our Committee gives very close scrutiny to over the coming months. Of course, the Senate will be informed of those deliberations when we report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to conclude with one matter which was brought to my attention last week. I would like the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) to give a response, if it is possible, in closing the second reading debate. A number of concerns have been raised with me by chartered accountants from Perth, Western Australia. There may well be concerns in the eastern capitals as well.

<PARA>The Government has moved some minor technical amendments during this committee stage of the Corporate Law Reform Bill 1992. There are five significant and three consequential proposed amendments to the Bill. Four of these relate to the corporate insolvency provisions in part 4 of the Bill, while the remaining amendment is to the related party transaction provisions in part 3 of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the amendments were proposed following a submission to the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) made by Mr Ron Harmer, a distinguished Australian, on the day on which the Bill was debated in the House of Representatives. Mr Harmer, as honourable senators will know, was the principal author of the Australian Law Reform Commission's report in 1988 on its general insolvency inquiry, a report which is to be implemented by part 4 of the Bill. These amendments make technical refinements to a number of provisions in the Bill for the reasons set out in the supplementary explanatory memorandum. They reflect Mr Harmer's commitment to a project which has been a very lengthy one for him personally but one which I believe has, and will, yield very promising results for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make particular mention only of the proposed amendment to the related party transaction provisions in part 3 of the Bill. The amendment will allow the Australian Securities Commission to exempt companies from compliance with proposed section 232A where that would be appropriate. Proposed section 232A establishes a prohibition on directors of public companies voting or being present at board meetings in relation to matters in which they have a material personal interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The section provides that, where as a result of the prohibition there is no quorum of disinterested directors, the matter must be considered by the company in general meeting. However, there may be circumstances where, for reasons of urgency or some other compelling reason, the matter should be dealt with by the directors even though the directors have a material personal interest in the matter. The new section 232B will therefore enable the Australian Securities Commission to conditionally exempt companies from the section 232A prohibition where the section might otherwise disadvantage the company. The amendment introduces an additional element of flexibility without detracting from the important principle, that conflicts of interest must be brought out in the open so that shareholders can be properly protected. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating a package of Bills dealing with the maritime industry. I will confine my remarks mainly to the Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Bill 1992 as I do not have time to deal with the allied Bills. This legislation is proposed to replace the Seamen's Compensation Act 1911 and to create a new system of compensation for seafarers who are injured or killed in the course of their employment in the maritime industry. The Opposition supports the principle behind the legislation, that seafarers should have a rehabilitation and compensation system in keeping with contemporary community standards, as do members of the industry with whom we consulted very widely.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review of the existing legislation followed the recommendations of Professor Harold Luntz in his review of seamen's compensation. The Government claims that its decision to reform seafarers' compensation along the lines of the Commonwealth Employees Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 was consequential to the Luntz review. This is not the case, because the selection of the CERC Act was the Government's own doing. The Seamen's Compensation Act 1911 is clearly out of date&mdash;it is 81 years old&mdash;and this was acknowledged by Professor Luntz in his review of seamen's compensation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Harold Luntz, who was the architect of the Workcare scheme in Victoria, recommended that compensation arrangements be on the basis of community standards. Cabinet then determined that this would be the Commonwealth Employees Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988. The choice of the CERC Act was not necessarily that of the review, as suggested in the Government's explanatory memorandum, but was the Government's own selection. The Commonwealth justified setting the benefit standards at the CERC Act because this is the only other Federal compensation Act but it did not explain why an Act which relates only to Commonwealth public servants and some employees of statutory authorities and Commonwealth owned businesses and enterprises is appropriate as a community standard. I thought that anything to do with the Public Service was far above community standards, especially when the proposed legislation will cover only employees in private enterprise. It is not clear on what basis commonality has been determined other than the fact that they are both Federal Acts and the only Federal Acts dealing with rehabilitation and compensation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are major differences. The Navigation Act provides for a three months sick leave period, regardless of length of service, due to specific maritime requirements such as the need for complete recovery and fitness clearance to work on ships, especially for seafarers such as engineers, where the physical demands are specific. In the second reading speech in the other place when introducing the Bill, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Snowdon, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rate of benefits payable to partially incapacitated employees who are able to work will be on a graduated scale.</PARA>
<PARA>It generally is in most industries. Mr Snowdon continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For these persons the combined total of compensation plus earnings will be between 75 per cent and 100 per cent of normal weekly earnings, depending on the number of hours that the employee actually works.</PARA>
<PARA>However, one cannot be at sea unless one is 100 per cent fit. When I refer to being at sea I mean working at sea, not necessarily on a pleasure craft or something like that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the nature of the work, seafarers cannot afford to be 74 per cent, 90 per cent or even 95 per cent fit. They must be 100 per cent fit if they are to be capable of going up and down ladders, working in confined spaces and lifting and carrying in the performance of their duties and at the same time retaining a sure footing in difficult and unsteady circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, people cannot operate at sea under partial benefits because of their need to be 100 per cent fit. So these provisions lifted from the CERC Act are simply inappropriate. The CERC Act itself is subject to a review, currently under way, which will almost certainly lead to revisions in the level of and approach to benefits. It is not clear how the results of such a review will affect the provisions of this legislation that we are dealing with today. However, the Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Bill basically ties the compensation and rehabilitation for seafarers to the CERC Act while the CERC Act itself is currently under review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to know what the position of the Seamen's Union will be if, under the CERC Act, which is under review, seamen have some of their compensation, or whatever, reduced. I would like to know what sort of action the Seamen's Union will take. I presume we will have a strike on our hands immediately. It might have been more logical to delay the implementation of this Bill until the completion of the CERC Act review and the recommendation from that review could have been taken into account in this legislation. If the CERC Act had been the basis for this legislation then the Parliament might, as a consequence, be back here debating amendments to this Bill&mdash;all because the Government decided to bring forward a Bill tied to a system that is currently under review. So this may be a very temporary new Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has argued that existing Federal standards are the only ones that are appropriate for an industry that is not fixed to any one State. Indeed, the shipping industry in Australia locates its employees all over the place&mdash;from State to State, from international boundary to international boundary&mdash;in the course of carrying out their employment. The Commonwealth argues that, therefore, there is a need for the CERC Act to apply and that the Commonwealth should fix the terms and conditions of compensation and rehabilitation. The Commonwealth argues that there needs to be one set of standards established by the Commonwealth that overrides all State boundaries and State differences. It is typical of what this Government is doing in Victoria at the present moment. But this is not borne out by arrangements in the aviation industry, for example, where air crews are also habitually mobile outside their home jurisdictions for extended periods. Ansett air crews, for instance, are covered by home port jurisdiction even though they may be out of that jurisdiction for extended periods, and may be out of State jurisdiction of any sort. They could be on an international flight to New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is little apparent rationale for the choice of the CERC Act as the community standard. What I believe it does is to represent the penthouse level of standards for compensation, rather than the basement level. No-one says that any employees of any industry should have any compensation that is below community standards. If I can quickly find them, I will give honourable senators an idea of the figures from the CERC Act, as compared with a few others. Just picking figures out quickly, the lump sum paid to a spouse under the CERC Act is $139,321 plus other sums for their children, of course. Under the seamen's compensation agreement at the present moment it is $74,630. The figure for the Northern Territory is $80,449; for Western Australia, $83,336; for South Australia, $80,000; for Tasmania, $83,000-odd; for Queensland, $77,000; for Victoria, $108,000; and for New South Wales, $150,000. So the only State that is anywhere near the CERC Act is New South Wales. It can be seen that it is moving towards the penthouse level instead. Nor is it clear why it has not been possible to close off altogether the liability of the employers under common law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Act, the compensation will be payable by definite amounts on definite occasions, but there will still be some access to common law. One of the attractions of the arrangements in the first place is that they introduce certainty into compensation and make trauma and costliness of common law action unnecessary. It would be desirable to close off altogether that trauma and costliness. In common law action, settlements are delayed, often to the detriment of the claimant, and costs escalate, to the detriment of both claimant and employer. I could stand here and give honourable senators a lot of examples. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill limits common law action for death and permanent injury to non-economic loss; for permanent injury it is capped but it is left as an option in the case of death. It would have been preferable to make the Bill comprehensive in its application. There are other specific matters that we were concerned about and which were referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has accepted the explanation of the Government and departmental advisers, at the Committee's public hearing on 10 December, that in clause 26(2) the exclusion from compensation for self-inflicted injury includes death. If one looks at the explanatory memorandum, one sees that it has not been well defined. Clause 26(2) provides:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Compensation is not payable for an intentionally self-inflicted injury.</PARA>
<PARA>But what it does not go on to specify is that that self-inflicted injury may have included a suicide. The Minister's second reading speech does not say that the provision is to exclude suicide at work. We have been assured by the Government advisers that suicide at work would be excluded but in clause 26(3), where it provides for compensation in the case of serious and wilful misconduct of employees, it says `other than a self-inflicted injury'. While we do take on board the Government's explanation, I believe that it should have been made clearer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The apparent exclusion of suicide from this clause has caused the Opposition a lot of concern. I believe that, while recognising that the employer was not responsible for a minor circumstance, that should have been addressed. The Opposition made the point that it might have been helpful to all concerned if the explanatory memorandum had made the inclusion of death under clause 26(2) far clearer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A similar problem arose for the Opposition regarding clause 26(3), where the exclusion of compensation to the employee for injury arising from the employee's own negligence is accepted but the employee or dependants are still eligible for compensation for the more serious case of permanent incapacitation or death. To hold an employer liable for something over which he has no control&mdash;indeed, `wilful misconduct' implies actions on the part of the employee contrary to the requirements or wishes of the employer&mdash;seems to me very unjust. The Government and the union representative at the Committee public hearing argued that the clause is a standard one in compensation legislation, both Federal and State. Senator Cook explained that at the time and I agree it is there. It is designed to protect the widows and dependants of workers when they are deprived of their support as a result of the wilful misconduct of the worker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the argument is that employees themselves suffer the consequences of temporary injuries, whereas their innocent dependants suffer the consequences later where there is death or permanent serious injury, the issue seems to be one of welfare rather than justice. The Opposition may not argue against the need to protect dependants from the consequences of wilful behaviour of the breadwinner but does question the justice of effectively holding the employer responsible. There is a manifest injustice in this, I believe. Including employment liability was justified on no better grounds than that it was the easiest way to protect the dependants. In no way can that be covered by workers liability, because insurance companies will not cover it, so it all lies at the feet of the employer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this stage of the legislation, because it is a general issue, the Opposition will not make an issue out of it. It should be dealt with in the context of compensation liability in general. It is one for the Opposition simply to take on board at this stage and once in government to look at in greater detail and in consultation with the States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Social security covers cases where there is unemployment and sickness and in a host of other circumstances. I believe that where a breadwinner loses his life by wilful misconduct the case should be taken up by social security. In some cases we are in a happy situation where all the employees are employed by substantial employers who can cover such a situation. But in this award&mdash;and certainly in other awards&mdash;where you have an employer of not so substantive means then that employer could be sent to the wall. Then, of course, the other employees of that employer will finish up on compensation alongside the wife and children of the employee who lost his life by his own means. I believe this is a measure that the coalition government will be looking at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter of concern raised at the Committee public hearing concerned clause 97; in particular, the mandatory requirement for a safety net fund to reinsure for catastrophe with a liability of more than $1m. The safety net fund is run by employers to cover employees on industry training courses and those on roster when in transit from ship or a place of training and who may become liable for a catastrophe or an event which results in several expensive claims arising from a single accident. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There appears to have been inadequate consultation on this clause, which the industry claims was introduced without proper consultation with the employers' compensation agency. In the employers' view, it cuts across the exercise of a commercial judgment by the fund's administrators. It is at odds with the principle of industry and employer responsibility reflected elsewhere in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Opposition's view the reserve powers to assume responsibility for safety net provisions are sufficient to safeguard the responsible commercial operation of the fund. Commercial responsibility should lie with employers and the industry until the Minister's reserve powers under the Bill become necessary, including the responsibility to access prudent levels of risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department argued from the position that the need for some level to trigger reinsurance was an assumed requirement and the industry representative at that inquiry indicated that the major objection to the Bill as it stands is the arbitrary setting of that level at $1m on the grounds that the industry is well able to withstand a higher level of risk and should, if the fund judges it to be commercially viable, be permitted to do so. The Opposition sympathises with this view and has, accordingly, drafted an amendment which, while still maintaining a requirement to reinsure, enables the level of prudence to be set in consultation with the industry and to be reassessed from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be that industry is well able to withstand a higher level of risk&mdash;and I have an example which I do not have time to give now&mdash;and the fund should have the commercial freedom to determine this. The Opposition will be moving an amendment in the spirit of finding a position that is acceptable to all and does not compromise the rights and freedoms of any participant. By setting a prescribed figure and requiring the Minister to consult with the industry before prescribing it, the industry will be able to put forward its case and the Minister will have the flexibility to react to changing economic circumstances which will include bringing that figure below $1m should he think it is fitting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill presents a laudable principle and noble motives that nevertheless show signs of arbitrary dealings which were not dispelled in the Committee's public hearing. The Cabinet decision to accept the CERC Act shows signs that that is not quite the way to go. The decision to adopt CERC certainly does not line up with community standards, but that is exactly what Cabinet decided. Explanations for the decision to adopt the CERC Act as the so-called community standard envisaged in the Luntz review are still needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are still a lot of loose ends to be tied up, because the Bill was hastily put together and was pushed through the House of Representatives on 14 October. Why it was pushed through so quickly is not quite clear. The Opposition supports the principle and the intention of the Bill, but this is the first instance where the Government has imposed upon the private sector compensation and rehabilitation requirements that it uses for its own public sector. In other words, we have got the CERC Act pushed onto the private sector. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats welcome this package of seafarers rehabilitation and compensation Bills, as do most people involved with the industry&mdash;if not because it is brilliantly comprehensive and implementable, then certainly because it is a blessed relief to see a Bill to replace the Seamen's Compensation Act 1911. The Seamen's Compensation Act 1911, even by its title, leads us to believe that the legislation we have before us today has been long in the waiting and, therefore, is welcomed, as I say, at least with relief.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concerns that have been expressed by Senator Panizza regarding details and apparent inconsistencies are concerns which were drawn to the attention, firstly, of the Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, of which I am a member. There were found to be several factors which needed to be addressed. I am satisfied that the Government has made a valiant effort to address those, and the subsequent hearing by the Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure also addressed some of the concerns that were expressed there. In fact, some of the concerns were ill-founded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats have had represented to them the concerns of employees who would be affected by this and of industry representatives as well. Essentially, the case that has been put to us is connected with this sense of relief that at last legislation has been presented to Parliament to address the inadequacies of the Seamen's Compensation Act 1911. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, the case boils down to this: if a Bill is presented to Parliament to address the problems of that compensation Act, even if it is less than perfect it will be acceptable. I must say that I have some sympathy with that particular point of view. To emphasise the slight inadequacies of this legislation now and to refuse it passage on the grounds of those slight inadequacies would frustrate both the employees concerned and the industry itself, so, of course, we would not propose to oppose it on those grounds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would welcome ongoing attention to some of the details which are purported to be problems; and I will not here attempt to offer a solution. I doubt that that is my role, nor would it be capable of implementation at this stage. I have little to add other than to say that the case which was presented to us by the employees who would be affected overwhelmingly persuades us to support the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the depth of detail that Senator Panizza addressed, I can see merit in some of the claims that he made, but I believe that the criticisms are somewhat overstated. For example, the criticism that the CERC Act does not represent community standards can easily be demonstrated to be overstated by the fact that the administration of the CERC Act in this particular instance is not just a case of handing over without any modification what would apply to public servants operating in Canberra and assuming that that would be relevant to seafarers operating out of Whyalla, for example. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These assumptions are just a little too easy to make. In fact, they are governed by a Bill&mdash;an intensely modified and complicated Bill&mdash;which covers almost 80 pages with an explanatory memorandum of some 75 or so pages. It is not just a case of saying that the CERC Act applies to seafarers; there is considerable detail attached to how, when, where and what provisions and what is involved. At one stage there was a suggestion that the rehabilitation requirements, which are welcome and which have a much more modern attitude towards workers' compensation than there has been in the past, were a little more difficult when dealing with seafarers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The term `able-bodied seaman' is not a quaint term but in fact a very practical description of what is required to go to sea; persons in wheelchairs or persons who are disabled physically are much harder to rehabilitate for seafaring jobs. That was a complaint which was registered early in the discussion with us. But in fact only a little imagination is required to see or to understand that rehabilitation can mean a lot more than adapting wheelchairs or other devices to help disabled people move about. Rehabilitation also means restructuring jobs and reconsidering what roles a person might perform. Counselling and other activities which help a person return to work of some sort are included in the description of rehabilitation. So even that initial criticism is one which has been addressed and which can be delivered through this Bill. I do not need to take any more time of the chamber to illustrate that the Democrats will be supporting the Bill. </PARA>

I think that would have been a clearer way of saying what the Government advisers indicated to us that subclause intended.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think what we are confronted with on this Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Bill is unanimity in terms of the purpose of the Bill and a considered debate, with different weightings of importance attached to it, about one element of this Bill. That element was brought out in a committee hearing in which evidence was adduced from the employer organisation and the union as well as the Department concerning the status of people affected by death or significant disability in circumstances in which they may have contributed to those things themselves, or did contribute to those things themselves. We are also confronted by a consideration by the coalition of the provision in this legislation concerning catastrophe insurance and an effort by it, in a foreshadowed amendment in the committee stage, to provide another solution to the one the Bill provides to meet that problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I think that the real debate is over whether or not the proposed amendment on catastrophe insurance is satisfactory. If that debate is resolved, whichever way it is resolved, I think that the Bill is then satisfactory to the Senate. In those circumstances, I want to thank the contributors to this debate and members of the Committee for the role they played in examining this issue in detail and for the views they have put. It is true that I do not agree in all cases with the views that have been put. Nonetheless, I acknowledge that they have been put after some earnest consideration, that they do reflect genuinely held views and that they raise and deal with matters of some significance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in terms of compensation payable to people who may have contributed or did contribute to significant disability or death in their own cases, I would say that the debate on that issue, while interesting, has perhaps not brought out this fundamental fact. The legislation we are proposing to deal with that is legislation copied from the previous Act. So we are continuing an existing principle; we are not inventing a new one. Additionally, I would say that all workers compensation Acts in the States reflect a principle of this type. They have not invented a new solution to it; they have persisted with the same solution that we are offering. The Acts in the States have remained consistent on this point, irrespective of what party was in government. </PARA>

In order to speed the consideration of this matter before the Senate, I will now conclude my remarks in the second reading stage. I will listen to what may be said on the motion to be moved by the Opposition on catastrophe insurance and I will reply to that argument in the committee stage.

<PARA>The reason for moving that we take out the figure of $1m and insert a prescribed figure is as I stated in my speech at the second reading stage. I believe that $1m is not so great an amount for this sort of industry with the combination of various people and companies. I will give honourable senators an example of a catastrophe event. Let us say trainees are being taken to a training session. Suppose a coach carrying the trainees is involved in a serious collision and there are five dead and 10 totally incapacitated. The lump sum payout would be approximately 5 times $250,000 under common law, to the dependents of the dead; plus 10 times $100,000 under section 39(9) to the injured. A total lump sum of $2.25m spread over 2,000 berths in the industry at large is $1,012 per berth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Compared with the total wage-salary bill of around $120,000 per berth, the risk of the industry being unable to meet such an immediate call to meet the liability is negligible. Of course, if there is a case of ongoing weekly payouts it would be much less per berth per year and the industry may well decide it could bear the immediate risk of lump sum pay-outs of around $2m but insure any excess. That, however, would be the commercial decision of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the reason we have moved these two amendments, and I thank the Australian Democrats for their intended support. The union representative told us at the inquiry that, after all, insuring in excess of $1m is cheap. But that may not be the case in five years time. I believe that if an industry can carry its own risk by its own cash reserves then it should not be forced into insurance in the lower figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By having a prescribed figure, which is covered in the amendments and added to in the second amendment, the Minister can, with consultation, move it either upwards or downwards.

Of course, they would be doing so, as it says in the amendment, in consultation with the fund, the Australian National Maritime Association and the Australian Minerals and Metals Association.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Democrats are convinced by the lucid argument of Senator Panizza on this matter and also by its inherent logic. To include a finite amount in legislation, we believe, has attached to it its own perils. As Senator Panizza said towards the end of his contribution, such provisions are becoming outdated rather rapidly and becoming irrelevant in certain particular circumstances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will just take a moment of the Committee's time to illustrate why, in relation to entirely unrelated legislation, I was reminded of that last night. At a dinner for the graduates of the University of Tasmanian I was sitting next to an experienced graduate in law who reminded me of the attempt in Tasmania to remove finite amounts defined in legislation and to replace them with indexes or coded amounts which increased or decreased as the value of money changed in society. It seems ludicrous that we still have in legislation finite amounts such as fines of #20, converted to $40, that are considered relevant. Those sorts of amounts might have been relevant in 1950 when they were first defined, but they have become irrelevant with the passage of time and the change in the value of money. Here we have $1m defined as being seemingly relevant at the moment but, as Senator Panizza has said, it is potentially irrelevant with the passage of only a few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other explanation that Senator Panizza gave&mdash;of the capacity of the industry to meet its own costs in certain circumstances and in certain situations&mdash;has been accurately described and surely can also be accurately deliberated on in consultation with the Minister; and that is what is proposed in these amendments.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the arguments put forward by Senator Panizza and Senator Bell. The industry is made up of some of Australia's leading companies. They are well able to self-insure up to a reasonable amount, and the consequence to the industry of having some flexibility in the amount of self-insurance means that they save a considerable amount of money in premiums which they would otherwise have to pay to insurers. It is a saving to the industry, and in these days, I think, everyone recognises that the industry includes both employers and employees. It is for this reason, as well as for the reasons that Senator Panizza has very clearly pointed out, that we have moved these amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, can I make a valiant effort to try to wrap this up by quarter to one when we normally adjourn for lunch. The amendment that has been moved does not offend us, but we would obviously prefer our own position. That is not to say we will roll over or that it will go to a vote on the voices and we will concede at that point; but I will say these things. Firstly, consultations were engaged in. The employer organisations said they would consult an Australian insurance company and come back with a quote. Two months elapsed and they did not do that. We had the obligation to present the legislation. We have done that. Secondly, this sort of thing is typical of State and Territory compensation schemes and the level we are talking about&mdash;$1m&mdash;is typical of those two. We are not out of sync with the States and the Territories. Thirdly, the cost we are talking about here is frankly infinitesimal.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We can argue about whether infinitesimal is large or small in degree, but rather than actually going to quoting the figures, which would take a lot of time, let me rely on the assertion. If the amendment were to be carried, it has these defects which I am surprised the Democrats just accept. The proper name of the organisation is not the Australian minerals and metals association&mdash;there is no such organisation that I am aware of. The proper name is the Australian Mines and Metals Association.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second defect is that this requires consultation in an industry with a long industrial tradition of only the employers. There is no provision here for consultation with the unions and, since the purpose of consultation is to try to get an agreed outcome, to exclude a major party that plays a significant role in this industry would be wrong. I would be more kindly disposed towards the amendment if it read `consultation with the fund, employers and unions' rather than named just the employers. I might even agree to it then. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Taking up that point, the Minister did say the insurance is infinitesimal at the moment, but what I said earlier in my speech in the second reading debate was that that is at this stage, and that has got a big bearing. We do not know what insurance premiums are going to be in five or 10 years time. So I still believe that it is far cheaper if it is within the capabilities of the employers to carry their own. The Minister will have the power to prescribe whether to move the amount up or down, and I believe under certain circumstances he could bring it down if we had a few catastrophes one after the other. The Minister could say, `Those employers might not have the capability to pay out on another catastrophe so I will lower it to half a million dollars'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the other matter that the Minister raised, I understood the employees' representative at the committee hearing was not terribly interested in that particular matter. It really is a matter between the employers, who have to pay the premiums, and the Government. As far as the employees are concerned, their only concern is whether they are in fact covered should a catastrophe occur.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By accepting the first amendment, I think the Government concedes, as we all do, that the employers are well able to cover the excess and it is really just a question of the Government insuring that it is not unreasonably high or unreasonably low and consulting with the employers who have to pay it so that they come to some agreement. As far as the employees are concerned, their principal concern is that they do get paid, and I think the Government and the employers would insure that with the raising or lowering of the amounts. As I say, whilst I do not think it was specifically put to Mr Byrne, he was there, he was participating very intelligently in the committee hearing and I do not think he was particularly concerned about the matter. In practice, no doubt the Government would give them a call. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise a matter of public interest about affairs of the Liberal Party in South Australia which have come to light in the last few hours. First of all, it was reported in today's Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> that in the Federal seat of Sturt the former Federal Liberal member for Adelaide, Mr Michael Pratt, has announced that he will be running against the endorsed Liberal candidate, Mr Pyne.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same article in the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> indicates that Mr Wilson, the sitting member who lost endorsement, is also keeping his options open about running as an independent candidate against Mr Pyne. This is an astonishing development.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further information has come to light this morning in Adelaide. Mr Pratt obviously was contacted by the press when he announced that he was going to run as an independent and he was interviewed on radio this morning on the ABC program compered by Keith Conlon on radio 5AN. Not only did Mr Pratt confirm that he would be running for the seat of Sturt, but he went on to say that at a recent meeting of the State Council of the Liberal Party in South Australia there was a move to expel John Olsen from the Liberal Party. He said that the media had not picked this up. One of the reasons that these things are hard to pick up initially in South Australia is that the Liberal Party bans the media from attending its State Council meetings; it attempts to hold them in secret. But in this case Mr Pratt, a delegate to the council meeting, has spilled the beans that there is a move against John Olsen. When Mr Conlon, the compere, asked whether the move was by Brown supporters, Mr Pratt confirmed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes, it was moved on the floor. I guess they didn't get John, so I guess at some meeting they'll probably want to move to expel me . . . </PARA>
<PARA>We have an extraordinary situation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure that Senator Hill will get up and put the record straight, as far as he is aware of it, but I find it interesting that his party in the past was good enough to endorse Mr Pratt, it wallowed in the victory when he won the Adelaide by-election in 1988 as one of the new young bloods to regenerate the Liberal Party, but now, when he is running around dropping buckets on the Liberal Party, people do not want to know him.

This is the Party that Senator Macdonald is telling me is doing so well in South Australia, according to the polls.

One of them was made Speaker of the Legislative Assembly in South Australia and the other two were given jobs in the Ministry to keep them quiet. That is the way Senator Schacht's show operates in South Australia, and the people of South Australia have woken up to it. They are sick of it in South Australia. They were sick of Bannon and he got out&mdash;and not too soon. He knew what was coming out in the Royal Commission, which was highly critical of his leadership of South Australia and his failures in relation to the bank.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a matter of interest, he was being briefed by one of the board members at that time, and the now Premier was then Minister of Industry, so he knew what was going on.

That is why the Liberal Party in South Australia is so far ahead in the polls, because people are angry at the economic incompetence which has cost them so much. That is the background.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">NOTES ON DRAFT TOXIC CHEMICALS (COMMUNITY RIGHT TO KNOW BILL) 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill gives legislative power to a Registrar to obtain from industries using toxic chemicals information pertaining to their use, storage, handling, transportation, recycling and manufacture.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will not only provide for a National inventory of all toxic chemicals currently in use in Australia, but also the information relating to the health and environmental effects of toxic chemical use, reports from industry of toxic chemical releases, the production and disposal of toxic chemicals, reports on the emergency procedures that are in place and reports on methods of reducing the use of toxic chemicals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most important and fundamental object of this legislation however, is that all this information is to be made freely available to the community through the Registrar.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is stressed that this Bill by no means overrides any other Acts. It does however make a significant contribution to enabling the free access of information to the community. Like the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act 1989 and the National Occupational Health and Safety Act, this Legislation will encourage uniformity of regulation by the States and Territories&mdash;something which is well overdue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is through the recent experience of Coode Island in Melbourne, that we have been reminded of the urgent need for this Legislation. This experience highlights clearly the necessity for the formal dissemination of information concerning toxic chemicals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Had this Legislation been in place before the Coode Island disaster, not only would the people of Melbourne's western suburbs have been properly informed as to the exact nature of the chemical release, but the emergency services, media and the rest of Melbourne threatened by the plume of toxic smoke would have been informed as to the health effects and emergency procedures to be put into place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In fact the final report of the Independent Coode Island Review Panel (March 1992) recommended that,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"the government agree in principle to a legislated Community Right to Know to assist public understanding of hazardous materials and the production processes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no such formal legislative power at either State or Federal level in place at present.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently if someone wants to obtain information about toxic chemicals they go through the State Environment Protection Authority using the F.O.I. Act. This process has developed an inertia all of its own as ordinary people are expected to negotiate a bureaucratic minefield. Quite often the information is decided on a case by case basis (NSW), or the information is hidden behind the veil of trade secrecy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Legislation should not be considered to be an extension of F.O.I. It goes further by establishing the doctrine that toxic chemical information affects the whole community and as such the community has the right to obtain such data. It will no longer be the privilege of those whose vested interest it is to keep this information out of the public gaze.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my state of Victoria there are a number of Legislative provisions which limit information about chemicals to the public. For example information on the types and quantities of chemical products is not available except through The Dangerous Goods Act and Dangerous Goods (Storage and Handling) Regulations 1989 which require appropriate HAZCHEM signs displayed on site or during transportation of chemicals. This provision is solely to assist emergency services and not predicated on any public interest principles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is not enough information on these signs to adequately inform the public of emergency procedures or health effects in case of disaster. Other Victorian legislation deal only with very limited and specific aspects of chemical use eg. The Agricultural Preparations Act 1958.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The community Right To Know Bill would centralise all information pertaining to toxic chemicals. It would establish a collection point where the community can access information without the maze of bureaucratic red tape.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Chemical Industry Council (ACIC) proposes, under its Responsible Care Program, implementing Community Right To Know as part of their 10 codes of practice. Questions are raised however, as to the effectiveness of such a proposal when there are a number of qualifications which compromise its effectiveness.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, certain aspects such as emergency planning would be limited to discussion in consultative panels with plant management. The extent to which the information is disseminated would be confined to these panels and not to the public.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, the right to know would be subject to certain protections of privacy and commercial confidentiality and as yet there are no safeguards against abuse of those limitations to cover-up information which if publicly available would be a cause for concern.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill is aimed at ensuring that the public is assured of the Right to Know while protecting commercial interests within clearly defined limits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This overview has briefly highlighted the inadequacies of the current procedure for the public to obtain information on toxic chemicals and the dangerous precedent of allowing the chemical industry to initiate their own Community Right To Know policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The major elements of the Bill include;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The establishment of a Registrar, who collects information, as contained in the Objects of the Act, from the chemical industry and makes that information available to the public upon request. This will be done through the creation of an on-line data base, available at local libraries, a 008 phone number or through application to the Registrar's office. Studies both in Australia and overseas have shown that the chemical industry is unwilling to respond directly to community requests for information. Through the establishment of an independent Registrar these barriers will be taken away.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Only recently thirty companies in Melbourne were surveyed asking for information. To the shame of the industry only eight even responded. Fifteen of those companies belonged to the Chemical Industry body which claims to have its finger on the pulse when it comes to community health and safety concerns. Again if we look at the chemical accidents in the western suburbs of Melbourne 60% (19 out of 32) of all incidents were perpetrated by ACIC members.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Provision of information about emergency procedures, health and environment effects and reports on releases of toxic chemicals for public perusal and comment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly the environment would benefit greatly from the introduction of this Legislation. As a result of the publicly accessible data base and telephone hotline, the public would be able to discover hitherto secret information about toxic releases from chemical facilities. Facilities would report toxic releases to air, water and land. Already in the United States since the introduction of the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act in 1986,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"the national toxins release inventory indicate that releases of toxic chemicals have decreased approximately 20% on average since 1987. In the State of California, chemical companies have completely stopped emitting six hazardous chemicals and emissions have decreased for two-thirds of all chemicals for which data is available." (Adams, P and Ruchel M. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Unlocking the Factory Door! The Community Demands the Right to Know.</EMPHASIS> Report to the Coode Island Review Panel; Hazmag March 1992.)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Public involvement throughout the process of implementing and developing the framework provided for in this Legislation. For example, the Registrar will, in consultation with industry and community bodies, develop codes of practice regarding the safe production and use of toxic chemicals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Obviously industry self-regulation, although attempting to have the community's interests at heart, does not have the required commitment to work openly with the public. This Legislation would make the chemical industry more accountable to the community. Through the provisions in the Bill the public can find out what chemicals a business is using. The Legislation would guarantee public access to chemical information for use in emergency response, pollution prevention and/or control and local community information or action groups. The information would also be useful for land use planning, insurance, property transfer or any other public purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I should alert the Senate to the fact that the Bill has been subject to many months of community consultation. I am indebted to Mr Matt Ruchel of the Hazardous Chemicals Group in particular for assistance with the research which went into the initial draft. Mr Simon McRae of the highly respected international environmental organisation Greenpeace has also played a leading role in assisting me with the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The task of preparing a Private Senator's Bill is a great challenge because by its very nature it has to be prepared without the massive resources and expertise available to Government. In the case of this Bill, I doubt if it would have been possible to present it in time for the end of our 1992 sittings without the help of a Social Work Student Mr Tom O'Donnell, who was on placement in my office from July until October. Tom played a key role in involving community organisations with preparation of the draft and receiving responses once that draft was circulated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have to inform the Senate that as a result of this very comprehensive consultative process a large number of suggestions have been made to my office for the improvement of this Bill. In particular, there have been proposals to tightly regulate the availability of commercial secrecy provision to ensure they are not used to avoid disclosure of information about chemicals to the Registrar. These proposals have been borrowed from other jurisdictions where they have been effective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Due to the limited resources available to my office and the time required by many people who provided unpaid advice in relation to the Bill, as well as the Christmas rush of legislative work keeping the Clerks of this chamber very busy, it has not been possible to fully redraft the Bill to include this valuable input. It is my intention to seek inclusion of those points by way of amendments at the appropriate stage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill represents an important step forward in the protection of the health and safety of Australians and the environment in which we live. It is an attempt to bring us up to speed with other parts of the world where there is now a realisation that both the environment and the human race are gravely at risk of extinction if we fail to develop a sustainable approach to the way we live. I look forward to the public debate which this Bill aims to engender with the resultant response from the Labor and Coalition parties as they grapple with the community's expectation that they place the health and safety of people and their living environment ahead of the profits of the large corporations which have come to rely so heavily on the chemical industry. This conflict is not new. Indeed, in the next decade, I doubt there will be any other political dynamic which will so dominate the thinking, discussion and action of our nations body politic. I look forward to further community response to this draft of the Bill and to eventual introduction of a Bill which I hope will receive the support of the Parliament.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The issue I want to raise is that of foreign investment in Australia. In particular, I wish to raise the question of the level of foreign ownership which is allowed in our print media. There is no legislative limit on the amount of foreign ownership allowed in Australian print media assets. There is a reserve power vested in the Treasurer to reject any proposal concerning foreign investment which is judged to be contrary to the national interest, but this national interest test is so nebulous as to be virtually meaningless. There is basically a total discretion with the Executive and no parliamentary or other control on the decisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recent media reports indicate that the Foreign Investment Review Board is currently or will soon be considering an application to allow an increase in foreign ownership of the Fairfax group. Mr Conrad Black is apparently attempting to increase his holdings above 15 per cent and the United States investors are also apparently seeking approval to raise their 5 per cent non-voting interest. The Australian public is completely shut out of the decision making process in this matter. As we have argued here many times, the media is a special industry. It is intrinsic to modern life in so many ways and the impact of the media on our culture and on the nature of our country is immense. Not only are our views on so many subjects and especially the rest of the world influenced by the media, but the image of Australia and Australians which is projected to the world is inexorably linked to our media, especially print media. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for these reasons that the Democrats support legislation which limits the level of foreign ownership of print media. We have such legislative control over radio and television that we may ask why newspapers and magazines should be treated differently? Mr Bryan Frith, writing in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper, made an interesting point when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It must be presumed that Canadian publisher Mr Conrad Black would not seek formal approval to lift his stake in press group John Fairfax Holdings to 25 per cent unless he believed it would be forthcoming.</PARA>
<PARA>The office of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is reported as saying that no guarantees have been given. I say to him that sure, we all know about the policy making processes in the Labor Party. Prime Minister Keating decides all policy at the moment, often as a result of a bet with Senator Schacht. Who in the Labor Party is left to care that Caucus set the current limit only one year ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to remember that it is Mr Dawkins, and only he, as Treasurer, who has the power to refuse the application. Legally Mr Keating has no status whatsoever. Mr Dawkins is on record as opposing any increase above the current arrangements. I think it begs the question what exactly has changed which would justify any alteration. Why have investors decided that now, of all times, is the appropriate time to apply for an increased holding? Normally this period is not good for investment; there is a lot of uncertainty on the outcome of the election and hence on the commercial environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely it is inappropriate that media ownership policy is influenced by the stage of the electoral cycle. If the Treasurer wishes to stop the increase he simply has to say so publicly. I would contend that silence demonstrates a new flexibility on this issue which cannot be justified by recent events. What is needed is a whole new regime of regulation of foreign investment in Australia and to that end I seek leave to table for discussion purposes a draft Bill and an explanatory statement proposing to reform the current foreign investment review regime. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The document read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill concerns a matter of great importance for the longterm development and security of this country. It concerns the economic sovereignty of this nation and it concerns the standards which Australia imposes on the international investment community. This Bill is not anti-foreign investment, it is unashamedly pro good foreign investment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill proposes to fulfil a promise made by the former Treasurer, Mr Phillip Lynch, on 1 April 1976 in the House of Representatives when the Foreign Investment Review Board was established. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Initially we will establish the Board by administrative action. It is proposed that it be given a statutory basis as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, more than 16 years later, that proposal has been ignored by all of the 5 subsequent Commonwealth Treasurers. This legislation proposes to remedy that inaction by establishing an independent statutory Foreign Investment Review Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission will take over the existing responsibilities of the Board and it will obtain enhanced powers and responsibilities. I will detail those later, however it is important to consider how an independent Commission will differ from the current arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The FIRB has close administrative arrangements with the Commonwealth Treasury. There is a branch of the Treasury, the Foreign Investment Branch, which provides services to the FIRB.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Board's primary function is to assist the Government in administering foreign investment policy. The Board examines proposals by foreign interests to undertake direct investment in Australia and advises the Government on whether they satisfy the existing guidelines and hence should be approved. So, in essence, the FIRB is simply an advisory body&mdash;the Treasurer has the final say on foreign investment matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has been criticism that the Board is captive to the Treasury, which is under the control of the Minister. Thus even though the Board may act independently, there is always the appearance of the Board being captive to Government and hence being subject to political interference in its deliberations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This cloud could be lifted by granting the Board statutory independence and that is one of the effects of this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A criticism which is levelled at the Board is that it is a "toothless tiger". Even in the relatively rare circumstance where the Board advises the Treasurer to impose some conditions on a foreign investment proposal, and the Treasurer agrees to such conditions, then there is absolutely no follow up to ensure that the conditions have actually been honoured. That is, there is no compliance function routinely undertaken by the Board.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly this will weaken the value of any conditions imposed on foreign investment and should be remedied. A broad example concerns the development of land. There is a general condition in foreign investment policy that foreign investors cannot speculate on urban land holdings. Accordingly, acquisition of vacant real estate for development is generally allowed where the development occurs within 12 months. There are many examples in Queensland where this requirement has been breached yet no action has been taken against the investors concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 6 of the Bill specifically provides that one of the functions of the Commission is to ensure compliance by foreign investors with decisions made with respect to foreign investment matters. This will ensure that voluntary compliance by investors improves, and that the proper auditing of the conditions applied to investments will ensure that involuntary compliance will also be improved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill proposes to grant to the Commission both the statutory duty to consider all reviewable submissions on foreign investment and more importantly to make decisions in respect of those submissions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently it is a matter of administrative practice that reviewable investment proposals are submitted to the FIRB. There is no statutory obligation that this occur. The Bill mandates that the investor must submit his or her proposal to the Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also proposes to depoliticise the process of approval by granting deliberative powers to the Commission. The current advisory role of the Board will be replaced by a Commission with a deliberative power.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are numerous reasons for granting a deliberative role for the Commission. Firstly, in practice the Board's advice is generally relied on and is the de facto decision maker. I believe that this reality should be reflected in the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, under the current arrangements it is impossible to find out whether the Treasurer acts on the advice of the FIRB or completely ignores that advice. This lack of transparency means that it is impossible to discern whether decisions are made on economic grounds or on political grounds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To overcome this problem, it is proposed that, although the Commission will be granted a deliberative power, a reserve power to override any decision of the Commission will be left with the Treasurer. That is, the final say will remain with the Minister. The Treasurer may reverse or alter any decision and attach any condition to any decision, however any such reversal or alteration of a decision must be in writing and must be published in the Gazette and tabled in both Houses of Parliament, with an explanatory statement, within 15 sitting days.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This system will enable the public to be aware of the original advice on any proposal and the changes imposed by the Treasurer and the reasons for those changes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule 1 of the Bill proposes to codify the principles which must be used by the Commission in determining applications for foreign investment into Australia. The first of these is the net economic benefit to Australia of the proposed investment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This should not be a contentious matter. Surely it is reasonable that Australia says to the world&mdash;we welcome investment from outside this country as long as there is a clear economic benefit to Australia, and the investment is not against the national interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government  amended the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 during the 1980's to remove the "net economic benefit" test and replaced it with the deliberately nebulous criterion of "not contrary to the public interest".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly this is ludicrous. Why shouldn't the Treasurer have the power to reject a project because it doesn't provide any economic benefits?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission will also have an important power concerning public enquiries into any aspect of foreign investment in Australia. The Treasurer, or either House of Parliament will have the power to refer any foreign investment matter to the Commission for enquiry and report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This could involve a particular investment proposal, such as the Multi-Function Polis or a general reference such as an enquiry into the level of foreign ownership in a particular industry. Members of the public would be entitled to make submissions and to appear before these enquiries, thereby strengthening public participation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission will also have to establish and maintain a comprehensive register of foreign investment in Australia. There is considerable public unease over the growing level of foreign ownership in the Australian economy. This unease is fostered, in part, by the refusal of successive Governments to establish a comprehensive register showing the level of foreign ownership in Australia. Obsession with secrecy and with impugning the motives of those who speak out about our future if we "sell the farm", are the usual responses of Government&mdash;however these concerns about our longterm economic sovereignty continue to represent legitimate community concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is now a trend at the State level to establish registers of foreign investment in land. Queensland led the way in this matter, Western Australia has recently followed suit and there are Bills before the Parliaments of South Australia and Tasmania on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission will register all foreign investment, not just land, with appropriate exemptions applying so as to minimise the administrative task. This register will enable the community to know the extent of foreign ownership of Australian assets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently the foreign investment policy of the Government is simply policy. There are no legislative provisions for most sectors of the economy; broadcasting is an obvious exception. This means that the control of foreign investment is dominated by the Executive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This situation is defended as appropriate by some on the basis that great flexibility is needed in this area. That approach is rejected by the Democrats.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Parliament should decide upon the appropriate regime for foreign investment. Parliamentary scrutiny should be needed before the rules are liberalised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, in the One Nation Statement, the Government unilaterally increased the thresholds below which foreign investment proposals are not examined, and abolished the requirement for Australian equity participation in mining ventures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the stroke of a pen the Government decided that it will cease to examine proposals by foreign interests to purchase or establish businesses with a value of less than $50 million in almost all sectors of the economy. This quite literally means that virtually every rural property in Australia could be acquired by foreign interests, without the FIRB even examining the acquisitions. Few, but this Labor Government, desperate for any foreign capital, would argue that such a scenario is in the national interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill is still in draft form. I am tabling it to encourage community debate on the issue and I welcome feedback and suggestions for refinement and improvement.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I seek leave to table for discussion purposes a draft Bill relating to removing restrictions on serving in the Public Service after attaining the age of 65 years, to incorporate notes on the draft and to make a brief statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The document read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Acting Deputy President, since 1988, the Coalition's Retirement Income Policy has committed the Liberal and National Parties to legislate to provide that age alone shall not be a barrier to employment. The removal of discrimination in employment on the basis of age is a key component of our Fightback plan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Private Members Bill, the Public Service (Abolition of Compulsory Retirement Age) Bill 1992, covers Commonwealth Employment and the Australian Public Service only. It does not transcend State rights but complements current State legislation relating to age discrimination and/or compulsory retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill has two objectives. First, it allows the recruitment of officers by the Commonwealth after the age of 65. Second, it allows people who are employed by the Commonwealth to work beyond retirement age.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill addresses two separate issues. First, it is a fact that middle aged people are finding it increasingly difficult to get work after being retrenched. A recent study conducted at Monash University found this was due to an attitude amongst employers that older workers are inflexible, complacent, have more health problems and are unwilling to retrain. The Coalition believes this attitude is totally misplaced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Middle aged people now make up the majority of the long term unemployed. The national average duration of unemployment for men aged 35-54 is 63 weeks. For women of the same age it is 100 weeks. The continuing high level of redundancies guarantees this trend will continue unless there is a fundamental change to national policy, as is proposed by the Coalition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second issue is the growing trend towards early retirement in Australia. Some companies are now influencing staff to retire as early as age 50. The Coalition believes that it is in the national interest to ensure that our mature and skilled workforce is productively employed as long as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Quite rightly, age discrimination is a matter of great concern to many pensioner and elderly groups. There is a growing and quite legitimate perception in the community that people are often denied employment opportunities regardless of their ability, qualifications and experience, simply on the basis of their age. Older people are also being forced to leave employment prematurely due to many employers' compulsory retirement and redundancy policies. The Coalition believes that it is unfair to say to people at an arbitrary point in their lives that they are no longer capable members of the workforce.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I said earlier, the focus of this Bill is to eradicate compulsory retirement in the Australian Public Service and to ensure that age is not a bar to a person being hired or continuing to be employed in the public service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently, the Public Service Act makes provision for compulsory retirement on attaining a maximum retirement age of 65 for men and 60 for women, or following an extension if granted in special cases. The Act also provides for an option to retire at an earlier age. Finally, the existing Act provides a bar to certain appointments of persons over 65 years of age or for a period extending beyond that age.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In its response to a Parliamentary report on 10 November 1992, the Government finally agreed with the Coalition that compulsory retirement in the public service should be abolished. It is worth noting that since the last election, the Coalition has consistently amended Government legislation to prevent government appointments from automatically expiring at age 65.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the Government has finally got to the stage of seeking a submission from the public service in relation to this matter, this Bill recognises that, without any doubt, the abolition of compulsory retirement is a Coalition initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments to the Public Service Act in this Bill will cover the major areas of public sector employment. However, by necessity, there are some exemptions. The judiciary, following an amendment to the Constitution in 1977, retire on reaching age 70. The armed forces and the police force will also be exempt. The Act is scheduled to take effect as of 1 July 1995 to allow sufficient time to adjust personnel planning policies and for the relevant authorities to make any necessary adjustments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, it needs to be stated that the Coalition believes there is a role for government in establishing the retirement parameters of its own public service and setting an example for the private sector. The purpose of this legislation is to give the community at large the opportunity to comment on this important issue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Hopefully, it will also encourage those State governments which have not yet moved to eradicate compulsory retirement&mdash;notably Tasmania&mdash;as well as the private sector to move in this direction as well.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak very briefly today&mdash;I will be much briefer than I had intended, because of our time constraints&mdash;on food labelling. Labelling laws in this country, when we come to food, are inadequate. Many honourable senators would not be aware of the fact that one really cannot tell where the contents of products come from&mdash;and yet those products are labelled `Product of Australia'.

Through our work over the last nine months on this issue we can find only one brand of peanut butter that actually has Australian peanuts in it, but all brands are labelled on our shelves `Product of Australia'. More and more Australians are keen to buy Australian products. The problem is that they do not know when they really are buying Australian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats have launched in South Australia, along with a major food retailing chain, Foodland, which is doing this as a public service, a new scheme which allows shoppers to very quickly identify when a product is Australian, when the contents of the product are Australian, when the product is actually put together and processed here and when the company doing all of that is an Australian company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scheme divides products into three categories: category A, category B and category C. These products are identified on the shelves of supermarkets by stickers. Category A has a green sticker, which denotes products made in Australia from Australian materials by an Australian controlled company. Blue stickers show products made in Australia from Australian materials by a foreign controlled company. The red sticker identifies those products that have some significant Australian input, although nothing like A or B.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise a matter which I raised when commenting on the annual report of the Federal Airports Corporation. In commenting on that annual report, I indicated concern about the effects of the trend towards privatisation and corporatisation of government departments or government bodies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose, I would have thought, of the administrative body of airports would have been to administer airports safely, efficiently and equitably to provide equal access to all citizens using those facilities. But no, we are told in the annual report of the FAC that there is a new purpose since corporatisation; and that new purpose is to chase profits, to make a priority of increasing the income from non-aeronautical operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That should be of concern to all Australians, because the effect of that new priority is to compromise the future of enterprises which rely upon serving the people who arrive at airports. Not the least of those is evident in Tasmania, in particular&mdash;the hire car business. The rent-a-car or hire car business in Tasmania, which is focused upon airports, has few options but to focus on airports because of the geographical nature of the place, and yet those particular enterprises are being required by the new breed of FAC to consider paying extraordinary amounts of money to continue their operations from those airports. There is no option. It is not an option to operate 20 kilometres away at a city. People arrive at airports and are then in the situation of seeking to hire a car. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great bargaining disadvantage in which these enterprises find themselves when trying to negotiate a reasonable rate to pay the FAC to operate from the airports is that there is only one FAC and only one opportunity to establish an enterprise at the airport. The problem is that, after many months of negotiation in this unequal position, in Tasmania in particular the current situation is undefined. There have been several revisions. All of them have been in the nature of impositions from the FAC, with little opportunity for the other party to the bargaining process to participate realistically. Yet it is still undefined because the latest version cannot be ratified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not know what the current situation is. All we know is that the smaller operators are being asked to pay amounts of money which are extraordinarily out of kilter with both their earnings and the size of their operation. We do not know what the liability is or what the situation is if those small operators are not able to accept the terms that have been offered in such a manner by the FAC. So we have a very inequitable situation which is likely to threaten the very future of a considerably large part of the tourism industry in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to mention briefly another matter that I have been pursuing in this place for some time. It is the situation with regard to another industry which is very important to Tasmania and is part of the aquiculture industry&mdash;the growing of oysters in Tasmania. We have a situation whereby the established growers of oysters in Tasmania were enticed, with favourable terms being offered, to take part in a project that involved the growing-on of Tasmanian native oysters at established leases. Having become part of that arrangement, established growers who were participating later suffered the indignity and the personal cost of having the project oysters removed from those leases because it was suspected that they would be affected by bonamia, a disease that has created havoc in European oyster-beds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The solution offered by the Tasmanian Government was to declare all Tasmanian waters affected by bonamia. This solution was offered in defiance of the accepted international method of managing that disease. The effect of that was that those Tasmanian enterprises which had gained considerable income from exporting oyster spat to South Australia in particular and also to New Zealand and which had prospects of exporting oysters to Europe were now faced with the inability to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ridiculous solution, which has been offered only recently by the Tasmanian Government, has been to declare individual growers exempt. Surely that is a nonsense because that would mean that, after a process of a couple of years, we might have 99 per cent of the State eventually becoming exempt, which is the reverse of what ought to happen. What ought to happen&mdash;and I challenge the Federal Government to do something about it&mdash;is that research should be conducted into which particular areas actually have the disease and they should be declared bonamia affected zones. If that were done, we would find that 99 per cent of the State would not be affected, the zones would be clearly defined and we would be able to limit the commercial activities of those zones to the export to other places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is this stupid about-face, backward looking activity of the Tasmanian Government which has compromised an industry which has the capacity to earn considerable export dollars for Australia and to create considerable employment in Tasmania. It is a labour intensive occupation and it is the very sort of thing which should be encouraged. It has been compromised by stupid bureaucratic action by the Tasmanian Government; action which should be investigated by the Federal Government because it is of Federal importance. The very scheme was established using a Federal grant to investigate its feasibility and I think that grant has been a waste of money because of the less than competent action of the Tasmanian department concerned. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I am not going to be very witty because it is really quite a sad day. I have actually regarded myself as a friend of Michael Pratt. I worked very closely with him when he inadvertently won the Federal seat of Adelaide in a landslide. Michael never intended to win the Federal seat of Adelaide; he was using it as a dummy run to find out what it was like to be a candidate so that he could stand in the State seat of Norwood. He was very surprised on the night of the election when he came in with his wife and children and we said, `You've won; you've won'. His wife did not look that happy and I do not know that she has been happy about his interest in politics ever since. It was certainly never his intention to go into politics and travel in the way that honourable senators know one has to if you come into Federal Parliament, because his children are quite young.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, Pratty was tipped out at the next proper election; he had got in on a by-election and was not re-endorsed. Apparently some bets were placed on this one way or another. I just ask people who might be listening and people in the gallery to understand the situation that a man finds himself in there&mdash;where he stands for Federal Parliament as a dummy run and gets in. One might think, `What luck; fancy having that fortune in life'. Of course, to walk through this place and contribute to it in any respect is a lucky accident for all of us; but to lose it so quickly, having got in on a landslide that might otherwise not have happened but for political events at the time, to be tossed around on the to-and-fro of politics over such a short space of time&mdash;I cannot think exactly how many months Pratt was in; I think it was 18 months or something&mdash;was a very difficult situation to find himself in. As positive as the experience of being here may be, that would nevertheless be very difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pratty, as he was called by the Liberals, decided that he would like to make a contribution to the Party in another way&mdash;to keep his hand in&mdash;and he sought endorsement as a vice-president, which he did not get. That was unfortunate. I do not say that he necessarily should have got it, but it was unfortunate to seek to make a contribution to a party in another way a short time after having had such a devastating personal loss and then be rejected. I will not say he left the Party because technically he stayed in, but he then distanced himself a bit and went about his life trying to rebuild his life and regain a career away from politics. But, of course, as we know, the bug once having bitten does not go away. He sought endorsement&mdash;and I am not sure whether this is in the right order&mdash;for the Federal seat of Adelaide at which he was unsuccessful and he sought endorsement for the State seat of Norwood at which he was unsuccessful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be a tough trot to try a dummy run at Federal Parliament, get in, be tipped out; try for an executive position, be unsuccessful; try for a Federal seat, be unsuccessful; try for a State seat, be unsuccessful. That would not be an easy situation for someone to handle. I am sorry that the pressure these losses have caused and the pressure the interest in politics generated by a brief stay here have all led Michael to decide to stand in Sturt&mdash;or anywhere else for that matter&mdash;as an independent, because we all know what the chances are of an independent getting up. The chances are Buckley's and none. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note that Senator Ray says that that is correct. He would be a fool if he did not. One just has to look at the record to see what chance someone has. This place&mdash;not this chamber but the other one&mdash;as a parliament has so attained someone's interest that he is now prepared to have another go, having had three goes at keeping involved in some way, when it is almost certain, although there can be surprises, that he is going to lose again. His chances of winning are Buckley's and none. I am sorry that this has happened to him and, in a sense, to his family.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to some of the things he has chosen to say this morning, my transcript was typed out for me by my office. Therefore, I expect that it is in different type from the one that Senator Schacht chose to use. No doubt it was provided to him by aNiMaLS, the Government funded media team&mdash;a luxury not afforded to the Opposition. There are a couple of points that I would like to make. I would like to put one thing on record. Pratty has used some pretty colourful language. That is his style. I do not think it would be a misuse of parliamentary privilege for me to trot through some of his views, expressed as he would express them, and let the electorate make the choice. But I will exercise some judgment and bypass the opportunity to do that under parliamentary privilege. I expect that he will let them become aware of his views in relation to a number of matters all by himself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He mentions me, and I think that requires a response because Senator Schacht mentioned it. I would not have bothered if it had just been Pratty mentioning it on the radio because, as I say, I think his chances of winning are Buckley's and none. But Senator Schacht chose to read out his view that I, along with Joan Hall and Vicky Chapman, was a good supporter of his. That is true for me and I believe it to be true of the others, but I have not asked whether I can speak on their behalf. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He goes on to say that we have marshalled together to roll a lot of people. That is the point I want to make today.

I think what Pratty may be referring to there is the effort I put into ensuring that Ms Chapman was elected as President of the Liberal Party. I make no bones about that. As I have discussed with other senators here today, when there is a presidential competition, everybody supports one or other candidate, however many there are. I happen to support having a 35-year-old successful, smart&mdash;meaning intelligent, but I suppose meaning good-looking as well&mdash;female running the Liberal Party, with an absolute determination to do what she can for it and seeking nothing out of it since her legal practice is so successful.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not call doing what you can to support a candidate in any contest&mdash;be it for a presidency, a preselection or whatever&mdash;`getting together to roll people'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also worth putting one other thing on record. I would go to an effort to help someone in a preselection, but not ring around on that person's behalf. I have never done that for anyone and I hope I never will. Expressing a view is one thing, actively ringing around and pressuring people is another. I regard preselections for this place as matters that people have to by and large conduct themselves. That is the way my Party's preselection system works: one goes out and speaks to people. One should do that for oneself and not expect other people to do that on one's behalf. One should treat the people on the college for what they are&mdash;people who want to exercise their own minds as to who should be the candidate on the day. That is the point that I wanted to address, that Mr Pratt somehow got the idea that I am forming and/or am in some sort of cabal to roll people. That is not the case, but I will continue to support and get on the executive of my Party those people who I think will do the best job for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Schacht made some remarks about the Liberal Party State Council meeting last Friday and abused the Liberal Party for not allowing the media into these meetings. I just want to put on record that there is one very good reason for not doing that and one reason why we allow them in at the AGM but not at other times. What we try to do&mdash;and we have obviously been slightly unsuccessful in this respect&mdash;is air our differences internally. If you have a meeting where, for whatever reason&mdash;and it is going to happen all the time in politics&mdash;some people want to go one way and other people want to go another way, one side will win and the losers will be unhappy. In any matter&mdash;whether it be a simple administrative decision or a deputy leader's position&mdash;there are going to be some unhappy people. In my view, the appropriate way for the Liberal Party to conduct itself is to ensure that the steam with respect to those matters is let off internally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not see why the media should be invited in to comment on that steam being let off. It seems perfectly reasonable to me that we would have such a meeting. In fact, I congratulate the President for ensuring that anyone who wanted to have their say could have their say. I am only sorry that a couple of people have obviously gone out and had a chat to Michael who, of course, was not there, which is why he is speaking in ignorance rather than with knowledge as to what happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last but not least, Pratt is a little bit out of date. He says that our candidate in Sturt is a 24-year-old live-at-home-with-Mum Young Liberal lawyer. That simply is not the case. He might like to acquaint himself with the facts before he opens his mouth next time. </PARA>

On this occasion, which we expect to be Senator Button's last Question Time as a Minister of the Crown, we thought we should give him the opportunity again to address the major issue facing this country, and that is the economic crisis. As the trend estimate of full time employment under the Government's policies continues to decline, with last month's seasonally adjusted figures showing another 78,000 jobs lost, can the Minister assure the people of Australia, particularly the young people coming on to the job market, that by early next year unemployment will not have reached the figure of 12 per cent?</PARA></TALK.START>

Mr Dawkins has already commented publicly, as Treasurer, that he feels that the estimate in the Budget may not be attained. I am not going to add to any speculation about unemployment figures.

In terms of those OECD figures, by 1994 Australia will be the fifth highest growth economy in the OECD. In 1993 it will be the fourth highest growth economy in the OECD.

Is Copperart misleading the community and is Senator Parer misleading the Senate? Has Senator Harradine offered to arbitrate on whether these employees will be better off as result of this contract?

Exhibit 1 is the Copperart contract; exhibit 2 is a certified copy of the award; exhibit 3 is the Copperart Christmas catalogue; exhibit 4 is a note from my Department; exhibit 5 is a statutory declaration by the union; exhibit 6 is a copy of the wages clause of the award issued by the Victorian Commission; exhibit 7 is a statutory declaration from the Secretary of the Victorian branch of the union; exhibit 8 is the Copperart press release unsigned and undated, issued on 2 December; and exhibit 9 is a comparison of wage rates under the Copperart contract and the Victorian electrical, furniture and hardware shops award 1991.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct a question to the Minister representing the Attorney-General. I refer to confirmation by Mr Rodney Adler that his FAI Insurance company purchased Westpac rights to affect the Australian share price index so that FAI could profit from futures linked to that index. Did the Australian Securities Commission undertake an investigation into FAI's purchase of Westpac rights and its subsequent profit from an increase in the share price index? If so, what are the results of that investigation? Finally, is the Australian Government satisfied with a system which allows individuals or companies to manipulate the stock market for their own speculative benefit?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not seen the confirmation which Senator Colston refers to about remarks made by Mr Rodney Adler concerning the involvement of FAI Insurance in purchasing Westpac rights to affect the Australian share price index. I do understand that the Australian Securities Commission, as part of its responsibilities, monitors developments in the securities market. I have been informed that the Australian Securities Commission is aware of the transactions referred to by the honourable senator and is considering the matters raised in the context of those transactions. Naturally, the Australian Securities Commission, as is its proper role as an independent statutory body, will make its investigation without any prejudice or interference from any remarks made either in this chamber or certainly from the Federal Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to Senator Colston's more general question about whether the Australian Government is satisfied, as he put it, with a system which allows individuals or companies to manipulate the stock market for their own speculative gains, quite clearly, in setting up the Australian Securities Commission and establishing for the first time companies and securities legislation which has a nationwide effect rather than the fragmented federalised system that allowed the speculative excesses of the 1980s to get out of hand and damage Australia's credibility, and certainly the availability of investor moneys through having confidence in the Australian market, whether from domestic sources or from overseas&mdash;all that has been remedied by the Commonwealth Government taking very firm steps to establish the Australian Securities Commission in its independent stance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that, certainly in relation to insider trading, the various reforms which have been passed by the Senate over the past 12 months or so concerning insider trading make very clear our commitment to a well-regulated market so that insider trading does not occur or, if it does occur, is identified very quickly and action taken to punish those involved.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not aware of the claim by Senator Bourne in her question that Mr David Irving was recently prevented from entering Canada, Italy and Germany on the grounds of violently racist views. I do know that Mr Irving has lodged an application in London seeking to arrive in Australia as a visitor on about 17 March next year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a visitor visa application, and it will be referred to the Minister when he considers these matters, perhaps in late January, in the normal course of these matters reaching his desk and in order to understand better the possible application of the controversial visitor categories which are administered within the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, in the public interest criteria, there is provision for consideration of the visa in terms of whether the Minister acting personally considers that the person making application is likely to become involved in activities disruptive to the Australian community or a group within the Australian community. Again, under the good character provisions, the question of whether Mr Irving has been deported from another country&mdash;as has been suggested, I understand, in some media&mdash;would also be relevant to consider.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bourne asked about anti-vilification legislation. While there are such laws in place in various jurisdictions throughout Australia&mdash;in New South Wales, Queensland and a couple of other States&mdash;quite clearly, whether there was transgression of such laws would be a matter for those jurisdictions and they would no doubt enforce such laws if there was any suggestion that Mr Irving or anyone else had transgressed them. As to our own racial vilification laws, I think they were introduced in the House of Representatives perhaps only last night but they are not to be passed until the autumn sittings of the Parliament. I would imagine that if Mr Irving was present in Australia and engaged in such activities as suggested, he might be subject to State laws in that regard and that would be a matter for the State authorities.</PARA>

For example, the Opposition spokesman on industry, Mr McLachlan, said yesterday that Australians should feel outraged by this grant. Why does Mr McLachlan say that Australians should feel outraged? Because, he says, it is a French company. I point out that this a French company that has been processing Australian wool in Wagga for 11 years.

There are nine pages of Australian companies that have received assistance in the TCFDA report tabled in the Senate yesterday.

I said I was hearing allegations of corruption and, for a  limited intellect like that of Senator Collins's, I can understand that he cannot understand the difference. In light of his answer, how does he reconcile the finding of the report that the advice to the board by Mr Baldwin and Dr Edwards was fatally flawed, it was inadequately researched and tested and Hughes was not assessed fairly?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen the report prepared by the Sex Discrimination Commissioner. It does find, as Senator Reynolds suggested in her question, that there is in fact discrimination in over-award negotiations. This is a relevant question because it touches on the difference on industrial relations between the two major parties in Australia. The report finds that, where there is access to independent arbitration in the event of a dispute over wages to determine a fair wage, the earnings gap between men and women in Australia has closed. In fact, we have one of the smallest gaps between women's and men's wages of any country in the OECD. But where negotiation has taken place between workers and employers for over-award payments&mdash;and classically, if a union is not present, that negotiation is between the individual worker and the employer&mdash;the wages gap between men and women has opened widely and women have come off second best and are the poor wage cousins, or sisters, of men in those circumstances.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Government respects and protects the rights of women to a fair deal in the labour market. While I appreciate that Senator Newman has maintained a constant stream of interjections to put me off the case in order to prevent the facts getting out, this report by the Sex Discrimination Commissioner is profound on this point: women would be worse off under those opposite; women in employment are much better off under us.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services. I refer the Minister to the New South Wales Health Department figures which show that waiting lists at Bankstown Hospital in the Prime Minister's electorate will double every year for the next five years because of the Federal Government's new Medicare deal with the States. I also refer to the fact that, since 1985, Federal Government funding of New South Wales hospital costs has declined from 40 per cent to only 31 per cent. In light of these figures and the Prime Minister's recent claim that Australians do not need to take out private health insurance, how can constituents in the Prime Minister's electorate expect to get access to a hospital bed when they need it?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The latter part of Senator Patterson's question did not give sufficient weight to the fact that a couple of nights ago in the Senate the Australian Parliament, for the first time, endorsed the idea of the right of Australians to choose public or private hospital accommodation for the treatment of their illnesses, supported by private health insurance. That has been made very clear and is endorsed by this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the question of access to public hospitals and waiting lists, quite clearly what the New South Wales Government ought to do is to accept the new Medicare agreement that has been put forward by Mr Howe, the Federal Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services. Over the next six years that will allow $1.6 billion in extra expenditure to be directed Australia-wide into public hospital services and, in the meantime of course, some $70m will be available to the States to enable waiting lists themselves to be specifically and directly attacked and reduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the Perth meeting of heads of government only a week or so ago, the Prime Minister untied the availability of that $70m to any progress on the resolution of the Medicare agreements. In that way, it is available immediately to be taken up by the New South Wales Minister if he is willing to accept the proposal for accepting money for a reduction of waiting lists. He ought to take up that offer. If he does not take it up, then the Commonwealth is quite prepared to channel the money that would otherwise go to New South Wales to reduce waiting lists direct to the hospitals concerned&mdash;and perhaps that is what we will have to do in order to ensure that the reduction in waiting lists program is not held up and frustrated by the intransigence of the New South Wales Government in this respect. By the way, I do not expect that intransigence to last much longer because, under Fightback, $1.3 billion would be removed from the public hospital system&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I said $1.3 billion would be removed from the public hospital system. In that situation, of course, the strain on the public hospital system in New South Wales would be absolutely enormous. I believe that in that situation, quite clearly, the New South Wales Government will be only too anxious to sign up in order to enable the very persons about whom Senator Patterson expresses concern to get the treatment that they deserve.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. I refer to the likelihood of continued levels of high unemployment and hardship amongst young people, as predicted in the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Wanted: Our Future</EMPHASIS> of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. Also I refer to this week's prediction by the National Institute of Economic and Industry Research that unemployment will remain unacceptably high until at least the year 2010. When will the Government acknowledge that there is an urgent need to redefine the concept of work to include such activities which are now known as voluntary work, and to redistribute work&mdash;for example, by reducing hours where possible for some individual workers? Does the Government also accept that to redefine work is meaningless, unless all Australians are entitled to a guaranteed minimum income?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am invited to comment on a report that has just come out. Clearly, the Government is not in a position immediately to respond, upon the tabling of a report, to the contents and recommendations of that report. I am advised that the Minister, Mr Beazley, is examining the report and will shortly make a considered response.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the last part of the question, in which I am asked whether a fair minimum wage should apply in Australia&mdash;I will come to the other parts of Senator Lees's question in a minute&mdash;the Government's answer is yes, of course it should. The award system in Australia provides, particularly in the private sector, for determination by an independent arbitrator of fair minimum rates for industry sectors. It is the Government's announced intention to legislate, using the external affairs power of the Constitution, in respect of the ILO convention concerning minimum wages in order to see that the minimum rates are basically protected&mdash;so that people who may be in positions of non-award coverage can negotiate knowing that they have a fundamental protection on minimum wages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other parts of the question were about the definition of work. I take that to be a definition for the purpose of determining the provision of government services or support for people who may be unemployed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not sure whether it is the most serious disaster for the number of years that Senator Harradine describes, but it is certainly unquestionably a major tragedy. Latest figures from Indonesian authorities put the death toll, following the earthquake in Flores, at 1,912, with most of the deaths occurring in the Maumere area. There are some media reports indicating that the death toll may well be over 2,200. It is a matter, I guess, of just seeing, unhappily, what the final confirmed figure is.</PARA></TALK.START>

President Suharto has expressed appreciation for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do stand ready to respond to further emergency requests from Indonesia and to participate in rehabilitation activity as requested. It is a matter of being responsive to Indonesian requests rather than really being able to do anything else just at the moment.

It will be at the readiness level as is normal. It was pointed out, I think, that using the Operational Deployment Force rather than other battalions did give us a strategic requirement to put a shelf life on our offer, which is 17 weeks&mdash;not from today, as I think Dr Hewson said, confused, a few minutes ago in the House of Representatives, but from their deployment to Somalia.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I  repeat, it is a report that is publicly available&mdash;if not through the parliamentary process, for obvious reasons&mdash;because it was launched yesterday by Mr Kerin. It is the latest in a long series of reports that have now been published under the auspices this year of the East Asia Analytical Unit, including reports on North East Asia, South East Asia and South China. In this instance, it was written by the former Australian Ambassador to China and Professor Guonan Ma of the Australian National University. It is worth the attention of the Senate and the nation, as it will be worth the attention of the whole international community, because it is a path-breaking piece of analysis of China's grain economy and trade.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal findings of the report are of major significance for Australia's export interests, not only in grain. They are as follows: firstly, China's per capita income is estimated to be between two and three times greater than official Chinese and World Bank estimates. Secondly, in the 1990s a very big shift in China's consumption patterns is expected involving the substitution of wheat for rice and meat for grain in diets. Again, higher demand for food and much greater competition for land for feed and livestock than previously thought could result in a shortfall in grain production of more than 50 million tonnes by the year 2000,  or about one-third of total current world trade in grain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How much this means for imports and what opportunities it will represent for Australian exporters will depend of course on whether the Chinese leadership can be persuaded to relax the present policies of grain self-sufficiency. That has begun to happen. In terms of China's resource allocation, to do that would</PARA>
<PARA>be a major contribution to China's growth. One of the many merits of this report is that it makes a formidable case which can be put to the Chinese leadership for doing just that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the implications for Australia, as the world's fourth largest exporter of wheat and barley, which are two of China's main grain imports, obviously the findings are of major significance, particularly for rural producers, because of the potential size of the Chinese market which has now been identified. We are very well placed to take advantage of these emerging opportunities and we are also well placed to raise these issues internationally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Garnaut and Professor Ma provide a far reaching strategy to deal with the self-sufficiency question. They argued that a narrow window of opportunity exists to deflect China from the path of North East Asian agricultural protectionism. We are already pursuing these issues with Chinese leaders and senior officials; we will continue to pursue them. Mr Kerin will also be writing to relevant members of the incoming Clinton Administration, the US Congress and elsewhere to draw their attention to the significance of this report and to enable some concerted approaches on these policy issues to be made to the Chinese Government. If that is not enough to satisfy Senator Bishop about the relevance, utility and importance of this report, I do not know what is.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 16 December, Senator O'Chee sought advice and supporting documentation clarifying what knowledge Austrade and the Ambassador in Copenhagen had concerning a proposal by a Danish company for the major piggery investment in Australia that has been exercising the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now table those documents, together with an index and guide to them, as requested by Senator O'Chee. As the index notes in the documents I am tabling, five of the 76 documents in question have been withheld either in whole or in part on commercial-in-confidence grounds. I have, however, acceded to a request that I have received from Senator Hill's office that he be able to view those documents on a confidential basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In tabling the documents, I wish to point out that they show clearly that the series of allegations made by Senator O'Chee, based on his extrapolations of the contents of the Austrade memo of 22 November 1990, are all entirely unfounded, and indeed erroneous. These documents clearly show government agencies going about the work that they are supposed to do in creating trade and commercial opportunities for Australia. There is no impropriety here, nor any suggestion that the connections that the Opposition is seeking to draw between Austrade and the Prime Minister's piggery interests exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout the life of the project from 1989 to 1992, Austrade offered its investment facilitation services where appropriate. This involved monitoring the project in Denmark and in Australia. Austrade worked to optimise the chances of the project which represented an important investment for Australia and which promised to generate substantial export income. It was also a project which was enthusiastically supported by the domestic industry and by various State governments who were seeking to have the investment located in their State.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The documents clearly show that Austrade worked to facilitate the investment, but did not at any stage give any assurance regarding its&mdash;Austrade's&mdash;capacity to resolve the quarantine issue. This was clearly left in the hands of the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service. The documents also show that, contrary to Senator O'Chee's suggestion, Austrade did not receive any application from the Danish company seeking quarantine clearance for the import of pigs or genetic material.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reports by Mr Landos of AQIS that Austrade and the Ambassador to Copenhagen, Mr Benson, knew details of the project in September 1990 and detailed these to him during his meeting with them in Copenhagen during that month, are borne out by these documents. Their knowledge of the project was perfectly natural, given this background of domestic interest and appears in Austrade reports back to Canberra in May and June 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have previously advised the Senate on 10 September, the Austrade memo of 22 November 1990, which reported advice from the Danish company that `all technical, principally quarantine issues, are resolved' was simply that&mdash;a report of advice that he had received. The documents also show that when this report was received in Canberra, Austrade sought to clarify this point and was advised that AQIS had told the DPIE that protocols had not been signed because in fact they had not been developed. DPIE felt that the Danish company was presenting an optimistic gloss for the benefit of potential investors. This was accepted by Austrade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, it has also been suggested by Senator O'Chee that Austrade was acting in the belief that the potential Australian investor involved the Prime Minister's company. These documents clearly show that neither Austrade nor the Ambassador in Copenhagen knew of any such involvement until it became public knowledge earlier this year.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the questions raised by Senator Hill which I will mention at this stage is contained in the following questions. He asked: will the Department make available the legal opinions upon which the assessment of damages and liability was made? Oral advice from the Australian Government Solicitor's office is that this information is covered by legal professional privilege and to release it could provide possible litigants with information properly the property of the defendants and their solicitors. Nevertheless, I have offered to provide Senator Hill, on a confidential basis, with copies of the legal advisings to satisfy himself that proper process was followed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order!  I am going to go through the questions and answers now. Senator Hill asked the following questions to which answers have been provided:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Q.The accident occurred outside the parliamentary precinct. I might ask you whether that is correct.</PARA>
<PARA>A.Yes. The accident occurred in the Canberra suburb of Hughes.</PARA>
<PARA>Q.Was it an exercise bike?</PARA>
<PARA>A.No, the bike was not an exercise bike. It was a Strida fold-up bike which was purchased to be used by members, senators, their spouses and children, and staff of the Parliament for recreational riding.</PARA>
<PARA>Q.Was the bike assembled outside the building?</PARA>
<PARA>A.It was delivered in fold-up form to the Speaker and unfolded by him.</PARA>
<PARA>Q.What was the basis of the claim? Why was faulty equipment being used by the Speaker outside the precincts of Parliament? We would very much like to know the nature of the fault in this equipment.</PARA>
<PARA>A.The fault was that the frame of the bike collapsed when the Speaker rode over a pothole. The issue of the Commonwealth being negligent arose because Joint House Department officers were considered by the barrister engaged by the Australian Government Solicitor not to  have exercised their duty of care. The barrister believed that Joint House staff had possession of a manual on the bike and information from safety officials in the ACT which was not passed on to users. The manual stated, `Do not ride over kerbs or through deep potholes' and `The maximum load for the bikes is 100 kilos'. Because the Speaker's weight was thought by Joint House staff to be in excess of 100 kilos, this information and any other instructions should have been brought to the Speaker's attention. The Department should also have advised that care should be taken in riding the bikes because of their method of construction and different centre of gravity from ordinary bikes.</PARA>
<PARA>Q.Who authorised the payment?</PARA>
<PARA>A.After receiving a recommendation from the Australian Government Solicitor the Secretary of the Joint House Department accepted the recommendation and authorised a settlement for the amount recommended, that is, $65,000.</PARA>
<PARA>Q.I thought that an accident which involved parliamentary equipment would have been brought to the attention of the Joint House Committee.</PARA>
<PARA>A.Following the accident&mdash;four Strida bikes were initially purchased&mdash;the equipment was removed from use. This action was taken by the Department prior to legal action being commenced. Equipment failures or breakdowns are not normally brought to the attention of the Committee. Legal matters go to the administrative functioning of the Department and are not matters for the Committee whose role is to advise the Presiding Officers on the provision of services and facilities to members of Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>Q.Why did the Joint House Department annual report not state that it was the head of the Department, that is, the Speaker, who was being paid the damages?</PARA>
<PARA>A.It is not the practice to identify the recipient of personal injury claims for privacy reasons but the Department identified the quantum of each claim settled in 1991-92 in its annual report for accountability purposes.</PARA>
<PARA>Q.What was the injury for which damages were paid?</PARA>
<PARA>A.The Speaker suffered injuries to both hands, his right elbow and face. The statement of claim relating to the injury states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a)fracture of the right radial head;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(f)shock</PARA>
<PARA>Q.What medical advice was given? What was the assessment?</PARA>
<PARA>A.This was personal medical information which was available to the Commonwealth's legal advisers. It is not appropriate for privacy reasons to publicly disclose this information which they assessed and took into account when recommending a settlement figure.</PARA>
<PARA>Q.What was the legal advice that the departmental heads&mdash;the Presiding Officers&mdash;received?</PARA>
<PARA>A.The Presiding Officers, in their capacity as heads of the Joint House Department, neither sought nor received any access to the Commonwealth legal advice. This was an administrative matter handled by the Secretary of the Joint House Department.</PARA>
<PARA>Q.The question of contributory negligence has not been addressed.</PARA>
<PARA>A.This was not an issue in this case.</PARA>
<PARA>Q.Details of the contract of hire.</PARA>
<PARA>A.No formal contract exists. The use of health and recreation facilities by senators, members and staff who do not pay an annual membership fee incurs a hiring fee of $2 per use. The Speaker was not a member of the facilities and paid the hire fee.</PARA>
<PARA>Q.Who made the decision that the Australian Government Solicitor act for the Department?</PARA>
<PARA>A.In the normal course of events the Joint House Department seeks advice from the Australian Government Solicitor on damages claims. In this case the Secretary of the Department thought it doubly prudent&mdash;because the Speaker had made the claim&mdash;that the matter be handed over to the Australian Government Solicitor to ensure probity in the handling of the matter.</PARA>
<PARA>Q.I should also like to know why the settlement was paid by the Department of Finance and not by the Joint House Department.</PARA>
<PARA>A.The Secretary of the Joint House Department has corrected earlier advice which he inadvertently provided to the Speaker and President. A form authorising payment based on advice and instructions from the Australian Government Solicitor was forwarded to the Department of Finance who issued a cheque on behalf of the Commonwealth and debited the Joint House Department contingency fund which provides funds to pay for claims and damages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Crane asked the following questions to which answers have been provided:</PARA>
<PARA>Q.How much was the total claim? Was it fully paid?</PARA>
<PARA>A.The settlement negotiated by the Australian Government Solicitor was for $51,205.55 damages, plus $3,794.45 medical expenses, plus $10,000 legal expenses&mdash;a total of $65,000.</PARA>
<PARA>Q.Was court litigation involved or was it settled out of court?</PARA>
<PARA>A.After negotiations lasting 12 months the matter was settled out of court in November 1991 after the writ of summons had been issued in the ACT Supreme Court but before proceeding to hearing.</PARA>
<PARA>Q.What were the legal expenses incurred by the Speaker?</PARA>
<PARA>A.After examination of the Speaker's solicitors' claims for costs the Australian Government Solicitor endorsed a claim for $10,000.</PARA>
<PARA>Q.Were they met by the Commonwealth?</PARA>
<PARA>A.Yes. They were included in the $65,000 settlement.</PARA>
<PARA>Q.Were any other legal costs involved in this matter which were met by the Commonwealth?</PARA>
<PARA>A.The Commonwealth met its own legal costs. The Australian Government Solicitor, as was the practice in 1991, did not charge the Joint House Department for its own costs. The Australian Government Solicitor engaged a barrister and passed the cost of $500 on to the Joint House Department. To assist in the consideration of issues arising in the case the Joint House Department obtained expert technical advice on the bikes at a cost of approximately $800.</PARA>

<PARA>Mr President, what you have put before the Senate is extraordinary; it raises many questions in itself. But there is only one issue that I want to raise and put to you in light of what you have said. It seems that what you have said is that the fault of the Commonwealth was not to advise the Speaker that there was an effective weight limit on the use of these bicycles. I understand that a woman from the health centre was on duty when the Speaker, Mr McLeay, came in to hire the bike and she refused to let him have the bike because he was more than 100 kilograms in weight. I am further advised that the Speaker later, undeterred, went back to the health centre during the lunch break so that he could hire the bicycle from another person who was unaware of the weight limit. I am told that the woman who gave the first advice to Mr McLeay that it was not a bike that was suitable for him to use gave a statement of the incident to the lawyers concerned. I ask you, therefore: are you aware of that statement? Also, now that you have been through the file in detail, can you tell us whether there is such a statement on the file?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I would have thought that the matter raised by Senator Hill was of the utmost seriousness. It may even be a sufficient defence to preclude any payment. In those circumstances, I would ask you to very urgently consider what material ought to be made available publicly. For example, it was said that certain documents attract legal professional privilege, including one in respect of which I think you said it was claimed by the defendants. That is certainly not the usual understanding of the term. It is a privilege normally claimed by the plaintiff. In any event, I would have thought that both parties could waive that privilege; in other words, in the interests of the public and given that we are talking about public moneys, both parties ought to be prepared to make all relevant documents available, including the documentary evidence in support of the claim and the medical reports. On the basis of the evidence we have, certainly from the scant nature of the injuries as described by you&mdash;and I would have thought you would have been in a position to have at least tabled the writ, which is clearly a public document having been issued out of the Supreme Court&mdash;it is very hard indeed to see the basis of the claim. For example, did it contain a claim for future economic loss, for any loss of earnings or any other pecuniary loss? If not, is that all meant to constitute pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, which is a very nebulous concept&mdash;one which Senator Cooney would well know, because he used to make these sorts of outrageous claims on a regular basis&mdash;which needs to be very carefully and independently assessed on the basis of expert evidence?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would want to know whether there was an independent investigator's report into the circumstances of the injury. For example, I note that you say that the bike was assembled by the Speaker. It may well be that he did not assemble it as he ought to have done. He may not have done up the nuts as tightly as they should have been done up. In those circumstances, it seems extraordinary that you can say that contributory negligence was not relevant. Indeed, the onus of proof being on him, I would have thought that there were considerable difficulties confronting any plaintiff in these circumstances to show that somehow it was the fault of those who did not bring certain matters to his attention. He ought to appreciate, presumably, what can and cannot be done in riding a bike of this sort; he ought to test it before he gets on board; and he generally ought to take account of his own physical condition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More importantly, it is absolutely impossible for anyone to make a judgment about the ultimate merits of the action without looking at all the relevant documentation. As an outsider, to me it seems an extraordinarily high pay-out. Certainly I would be amazed if it could be recovered in the normal course of negotiations for an injury such as this. We do not know, for example, whether the injuries had been substantially resolved or whether there is any permanent disability. Senator Herron, no doubt, is in a much better position to comment on this than others. But if we are talking about severe ulna nerve entrapment, I would have thought that that is simply a matter of an operation to clear the entrapment, and it does not necessarily follow that there would be any residual damage. Therefore, to merely say that there was a fracture of a right radial nerve does not tell us a thing. Was it an undisplaced fracture? If so, was there any continuing injury?  Unless we know those matters, of course there is no basis for suggesting that it is a serious claim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A figure of $65,000, or $50,000, on the face of it, for pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life&mdash;as Senator Cooney would well know&mdash;is something that one would normally be looking at if one was permanently and severely disabled. None of us knows the extent to which Mr McLeay is disabled&mdash;other than in his conduct of proceedings in the House of Representatives&mdash;but presumably he does not need an elbow or a wrist to enforce order even if he was so minded. </PARA>

I think that is the second thing to be conceded. Therefore, when Mr McLeay wishes to proceed with a claim for compensation, how should it be best dealt with? Certainly not by himself; certainly not by Mr President. I think that the Joint House Department was quite correct to refer this to the Government Solicitor.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with Senator Ray. There are two aspects that need to be covered here; one is the process. Mr President, I find it absolutely extraordinary that you can wash your hands of this thing. You are the joint head of the Joint House Department and you cannot say that the matter was handled at secretarial level. If you were not informed and you did not have a hand in it&mdash;and I accept that assurance&mdash;it was derelict of the Secretary not to inform you as joint head of the Department. That is the Nuremberg defence&mdash;`I didn't know it was going on'. Mr President, you do not have that right. You are joint head of the Department. So what Senator Ray said was absolutely correct: there is a matter of process and, within that process, you are responsible, Mr President, with the joint head. You are responsible for the expenditure of taxpayers' money, and you cannot wash your hands of this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point that I wish to raise is the appropriateness, as Senator Ray has said. Mr President, I would like to cite to you the compensation paid in each State to the dependent spouse of somebody who is killed in an accident. In my own State of Queensland a $77,470 lump sum goes to the dependent spouse after death by accident; in Victoria it is $108,640; in New South Wales it is $150,000; in South Australia it is an $80,000 lump sum and 50 per cent of the deceased's average weekly earnings; in Western Australia it is an $83,376 lump sum; and in the Northern Territory it is an $80,449 lump sum. Those are the amounts that go to the dependent in the case of death, and here we have $65,000 for an injury to an elbow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, I can assure you that, from a medical point of view, a displaced fracture of the head of the radius with entrapment of the nerve and myositis ossificans&mdash;and that is just a bit of calcification in the bruise around the injury&mdash;as Senator Alston has said, is a not uncommon occurrence in that sort of injury. It is remedied by a simple operation to pull the nerve out and, at the most, it will give 10 per cent disability. I would like to know how much disability occurred in this case. That has not been answered. But $65,000 for an injury of this nature is absolutely exorbitant, it has no relation to the injury concerned, and I believe that there should be expert advice sought on that matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there are two aspects, Mr President, as Senator Ray quite rightly said: firstly, there is the process, and you are attempting to take no responsibility for the expenditure of this sum of taxpayers' funds; and, secondly, there is the appropriateness of the sum that was given. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Herron read out figures that indicate the compensation a widow would get on the death of her husband. Senator Herron would probably find that that was under a compensation system. As I understand what has been done here, and as Senator Alston will tell the honourable senator, this is a common law action. It is a quite different issue. If there is a common law action, and if that action is justified, widows would get a lot more than the figures the honourable senator has quoted. Those figures&mdash;not that the honourable senator would have intended this&mdash;are quite an unfair reflection on what is a common law action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We have to decide in this chamber whether we want to go into the exercise of deciding what is a fair figure or otherwise. We can, I think, quite properly look at the way in which that amount was assessed in terms of who did it, whether the proper people did it, and whether the proper process was gone through. That is something we can look at. That is the issue that the President has dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be wrong for somebody who knows Mr McLeay, on the basis that the President does, to assess this matter. The President has stayed clear of that. What we can do&mdash;and there is no problem about this; I think we are entitled to do so&mdash;is look at whether the proper people made the assessment. As I understand it, a barrister, whom I take to be competent in this field, and the Australian Government Solicitor looked at the issue. We can look at issues such as whether they are the proper people to make an assessment. But I think it is wrong for us to be talking about whether the figure is fair on the basis of the evidence that has been given to us, because we are not in possession of all the evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that taxpayers' money&mdash;that is, money from Consolidated Revenue&mdash;has been used in the settlement to the Speaker should not be a factor which leads us to assess whether, on the evidence, a fair figure has been reached. Taxpayers' funds are paid again and again to people who have been injured as a result of the Commonwealth's negligence. So I simply say this: let us get around to the real issue. As Senator Hill said on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> this morning and during this debate, let us look at the process, and if the process is right let it go at that. But it is wrong to go into what is really an exercise for a jury. So I would propose that we proceed in the way Senator Hill has suggested. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Might I say with respect that it has only become apparent today, notwithstanding statements put out by Mr McLeay yesterday, that the final decision to settle at $65,000 was made by Mr McLeay's subordinate. It was made by Mike Bolton, the head of the Joint House Department. I do not reflect, nor would I reflect, on Mr Michael Bolton. The truth of the matter is that Mr McLeay is his boss. Anybody who has been on the Joint House Committee will know how much he is his boss. It is an intolerable situation for Mr Bolton to have to sit in judgment on what negotiations should take place, knowing that he was still in the employ of Mr McLeay.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the very least, with respect, Mr President, I would have thought that Mr Bolton, so as to remove himself from a personal relationship, should have referred the matter to the Joint House Committee, which is made up of every political party in the Parliament. It is, we are always reminded by Mr McLeay, but an advisory body, an advisory committee. I can think of no better an occasion than that for the advice of that Committee to have been sought. I note, Mr President, that you observed that that Committee is responsible for offering advice only in respect of services, facilities and amenities for members and senators. I would have thought that the provision of a bicycle would have fitted perfectly into that category. </PARA>

But when he is elevated to such a position, he is required to balance his rights with his responsibilities. He is simply not an ordinary employee who has injured himself as a result of the conduct of his employer. I do not make any judgments as to whether the facts as presented by Senator Hill as a question are right. But I would have thought that by any measure the ordinary, average, intelligent person, in taking a dismantled piece of equipment&mdash;unless that person had some particular skills&mdash;would have asked for the instructions.

<PARA>This is the most serious motion we can move against a Minister and it is not one we move lightly. The charge is that the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) was clearly negligent in the discharge of his duties and his responsibilities as a Minister of the Crown when he was the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support. A Minister is answerable for the actions of his Department&mdash;not in minute detail, but in the overall. He is clearly responsible for the efficiency and the drive of that Department in fulfilling its duties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It cannot be pleaded in the case of this Minister that he was ignorant of the charges that the Department was not operating in an efficient manner. It is possible, of course, given the complexities of some departments, on some issues for a Minister to claim in perfectly good faith that he has no knowledge of maladministration. Therefore, he is not obliged to vicariously accept any shortcomings of any of the officers or servants in his Department. But this was not the case with Senator Collins. Senator Collins had much advice on numerous occasions that things were wrong with the CAA TAAATS contract and he did nothing about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During his period as Minister, the chief executive of the Civil Aviation Authority, a Mr Baldwin, was appointed. The Civil Aviation Authority, on the advice of Mr Baldwin, abandoned contracts that were in train worth $200m and incurred $48m in cancellation costs&mdash;a cost which was borne not by the Department but by the public of Australia. The Department under Mr Baldwin embarked on an ambitious, new, nationwide air traffic control system. As soon as it embarked on this, irregularities became apparent in the way the selection process was going to be handled. Those irregularities were small in the first instance, but they became of increasing number and of increasing importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of questions were asked on both sides of the Senate about the process being followed by the CAA in this matter. Those questions were asked by individual senators and they were asked also by the properly constituted authorities, the Senate Estimates Committee, and by the Joint Committee on Public Works. Senator Collins never answered those questions in a responsible way. Furthermore, he never instructed his Department, the Civil Aviation Authority, to answer the questions that were properly put to it in the Estimates committees. He never advised people such as Mr Baldwin and Dr Edwards that Parliament is supreme and that when Parliament directs questions through a committee to the officers of the Civil Aviation Authority they, like all other public servants, have to answer those questions fully, honestly and comprehensively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The questions that were put to Senator Collins in relation to the Civil Aviation Authority were not trivial questions; they were questions that senators were properly asking in the public interest. It is history now that an independent inquiry, the Macphee inquiry, which reported yesterday to the Senate, found that the worst fears of this chamber were confirmed, that we were dealing with gross professional incompetence in the Civil Aviation Authority in the way it handled the TAAATS contract. You, Mr Acting Deputy President, must feel particular pride about your part in the Public Works Committee in the way you sought the truth in the expenditure of public funds on this matter. </PARA>

The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They persisted that something was very smelly against absolute and categorical denials by the former Minister for Aviation, Bob Collins. </PARA>
<PARA>What we have before us in this report is a devastating record of professional incompetence. The matter for the Senate to come to a decision on is: what did Senator Collins do about it? Every senator who challenged in the form of a question the activities of the Civil Aviation Authority was vilified or denigrated by Senator Collins. If there was not an attack on the questioners, there was an unquestioning support for the actions of the Authority, a support for its officers, for its activities. We were told incessantly that they were making the best of decisions and that it was of the highest probity. </PARA>

<PARA>Then he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I want to get one thing absolutely clear. The officers of the CAA have been constantly vilified and defamed in print. I think it is outrageous that Mr Baldwin and Dr Edwards were named in a newspaper the other day as having hijacked this matter and made decisions about it. They did nothing of the sort.</PARA>
<PARA>He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of claims have been made about irregularities, some of them quite extraordinary and defamatory, in aspects of the process followed by the CAA in relation to this project. There is no evidence to support any of those claims.</PARA>
<PARA>Further Senator Collins said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On behalf of the Australian taxpayers, I am pleased to say that in extracting the best value for money it is a very sensible way to proceed. During this 18 week phase the CAA will have the opportunity of extracting from the preferred tenderer the maximum benefit to Australian industry.</PARA>
<PARA>We now come to the piece de resistance. This final quote, which typifies Senator Collins's approach to the discharge of his duties as a Minister of the Crown, comes from an Estimates committee hearing on 31 March. The question from a senator to the Minister was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is the Minister entitled to answer questions that he anticipates we will not ask, or is he there to answer the questions we ask?</PARA>
<PARA>The response from Senator Collins was:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His second defence could be aptly titled `The Bannon defence'; he did not want to know what was going on in the Department.

It was totally open to him to do that&mdash;and Senator MacGibbon knows it&mdash;and he chose not to, and rightly.

I had no dispute&mdash;as the Macphee report had no dispute&mdash;with the technical evaluation process rejecting IBM. As Senator MacGibbon knows, IBM operates on technology from the sixties which is currently being phased out in the home of IBM, in the United States.

Hughes and Thomson were the front runners and Mr Macphee said that was also correct and proper. That is the correct decision that the board should have made; they were the front runners. It is a fact that they were neck and neck. An examination of the technical evaluation process shows that, because on every single criteria on scores out of 100, they were literally points in front or behind. As Senator MacGibbon knows, it came down to that very important issue&mdash;as it turned out to be in the minds of the board members&mdash;of the actual number of lines of computer code that were contained in the flight data processing components of the system itself.

I scrupulously said to the board on both occasions, and advised this Parliament when I did it, that I was not involving myself politically in the tender process, but the Government did have a legitimate concern about maximising the value for Australia of these projects. I had numerous meetings with the Chief Executive and the Chairman of the CAA on exactly the same matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the CAA short-listed the tenderers to two&mdash;Hughes and Thomson&mdash;I was advised that AWA, a major Australian company, was involved in both tenders. I was told that, I imagine, in good faith. But as I later found out&mdash;and I was angry to find out&mdash;I was told inaccurately. I was quite relaxed about that. On the question of Australian involvement, I would have liked to have seen IBM, employing 4,600 Australians here and having been in this country for 60 years, get up.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AWA is as good as anyone in the world at providing that communications equipment. I was advised that AWA was an essential component of providing the communications equipment of both final bids.

Hughes had entered into an agreement with AWA to provide the communications component of its bid. It was also an option with the Thomson bid&mdash;that is, AWA was also involved in the sense that it could have been used as an option for Thomson as well. But Thomson was also offering its own in-house communications equipment, which I had not originally been advised of, and it was offering it at the time I was involved in this at a cheaper price than AWA could have provided it. </PARA>

This was at the beginning of the detailed specification period.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no difficulty in placing that on the record because I said before, unblushingly, that my only direct political involvement in this process was in asserting the Government's concern about maximising job creation and the technical flow-on returns for Australians by involving Australian companies. I was then assured that my very strong comments had been noted and they departed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last night Senator Schacht alluded to my concern about my alleged preferences&mdash;as did Senator Calvert in a comment made last night, which was correct&mdash;and he is right and I confirm that he is right. This shows just how much involvement I had. If I had any preference, it was for that tenderer, knowing that both of them were neck and neck technically, that employed more Australians than the other. I do not step back from that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I then put in train the processes for establishing an independent inquiry, the report of which we are now debating here today and in which I do not feature in a critical sense. I called for the two most senior officers of my Department&mdash;Mr Evans, the Secretary, and the Associate Secretary, Mr Beale. This was held over a period of some months and it culminated in two meetings in May. We actually got down to the detailed discussion of how this inquiry would be set up and what classes of people would be involved in it. I can remember that a suggestion was made that perhaps the Auditor-General could do it. I said, `No, I think it should be conducted by an eminent lawyer, totally independent of the Commonwealth and the CAA, with no Commonwealth Government involvement'. I was given detailed advice on the procedures involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is, as I have just indicated, that I acted  scrupulously correctly.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Listening to this debate, Senator Collins would have one believe that he was the saviour of the Australian air traffic control system. He would have one believe that he was personally responsible for this inquiry. He would have one believe he was personally responsible for ensuring that we had the review. He would have one believe that he was some sort of omniscient, omnipotent grandfather figure hanging over the place, ready to pounce on the slightest whiff of anything that was wrong in the process. Of course, that is not borne out by the facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those of us in this chamber have a very good recollection of how Senator Collins dealt with the allegations that have been made about the process, about the operation of the systems and, ultimately, about whether the result was fair and accurate. Senator MacGibbon has gone through some of the things today that Senator Collins said to honourable senators on this side of the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Estimates hearings. when we tried to ask questions about this, for example, my colleague Senator Macdonald was told to shut up and stop making silly interjections. Other honourable senators were told they were stupid. Senator Collins told the Estimates Committee that he was going to do as he bloody well liked&mdash;language which is wholly unacceptable but, even worse, evinces an attitude which showed a total and utter disregard for the concerns that were being raised not just on this side of the chamber but also on the other side of the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say this to those who sit in judgment on this censure motion today: this censure motion is not about the CAA; it is not about Mr Baldwin and Dr Edwards per se, although their background, their activities and their characters are relevant factors. This censure motion is about how Minister Collins conducted himself, both in and outside this chamber, as the relevant Minister who was responsible for this portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When a serious allegation about the operational standard of a radar system or about the tender processes or about the people who preside over those tender processes is raised, it is never appropriate for a Minister of the Crown to abuse honourable senators and say they are stupid, they are ignorant or, when they are endeavouring on behalf of the Australian public to raise very real concerns, that he will do as he bloody well likes. That is not acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That in itself ought to be the basis for a censure motion against Minister Collins. Those facts alone ought to be the basis for a censure motion to proceed, but this censure motion does not rely solely on those facts. In fact, Senator MacGibbon has gone further I also intend to go further, and show that what we had was a consistent pattern of incompetence or unwillingness on the part of Senator Collins to listen to the facts, to treat them with open ears and to realise&mdash;for once in his life&mdash;that those of us on this side are not necessarily people who are out to score a political point but people with very real fears. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Collins wishes to address comments that have been made about the radar systems in Cairns. Fine, I am happy to do that. All senators on this side are happy to do it. While we are at it, we should address the radar system in Melbourne because Senator Collins has referred to it. While Senator Collins was talking, my friend and colleague on this side Senator Calvert, who is a member of the Joint Committee on Public Works, told me about the very real concerns air traffic controllers had expressed to the Public Works Committee about the operation of the radar systems in Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lest anybody here believes the stuff we have heard from Senator Collins, it is not just a case of missing planes but a problem that we have had for a long time of incorrect slant ranges on the screens so that the aircraft could be miles away from the proper position. The air traffic controllers said that the reason why they delayed aircraft into Melbourne for a very long period of time, why the separation range was increased from that which it was originally intended to be, was that at the original separation range it would not have been proper to operate the air traffic control system as the primary means of separating aircraft in that airspace. They had to change the specifications. Only after changing the specifications, changing the parameters, were the air traffic controllers&mdash;the people who, at the end of the day, wear the flak if something goes wrong&mdash;happy to continue using the system, and only then because they did not have an alternative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the true measure of the gravitas of this situation. It is really about a system which was not performing adequately. It goes further than that because, having established that the system did not perform adequately&mdash;and everybody knows it did not&mdash;air traffic controllers were coming to people on this side and the other side of the chamber saying, `These are our fears and these are our concerns'. Senator Kernot raised a matter, again on information provided by air traffic controllers and by engineers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having established that there was a problem, the next question is: what did the Minister do about it? The Minister would have us believe that he immediately moved to set up this review. That is utter nonsense. Week after week, month after month, every time one of us on this side of the chamber asked a question about this matter, the Minister called us sleazy, disreputable, dishonest, stupid or silly; yet at the end of the day the comments we made about how the evaluation process was awry were proved to be correct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Collins would have us believe that his only involvement in this matter was in relation to the Australian content of the system. That is not correct. I intend to convict Senator Collins on his own words.

Senator Collins had obviously made inquiries&mdash;or I would hope he had made inquiries&mdash;about the process for him to make that comment. Either he made inquiries and was totally duped as a Minister&mdash;for which he must bear the responsibility&mdash;or he made assertions in the Estimates Committee that would lead one to believe that he had made inquiries when in fact none had been made at all.

If this Minister had been doing his job it would be totally and utterly unsatisfactory for him to allow the CAA to appoint as head of its projects division a man who was under inquiry for his management of projects in New Zealand.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats think the question is whether the former Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, Senator Collins, persistently failed to investigate allegations and irregularities and whether we can prove that the delay really was an inordinate delay anyway. As far as we can see, the time line is as follows. In mid-March the tender was determined. By early April, when the Public Works Committee started the inquiry into the building works involved in TAAATS, obvious problems were surfacing in relation to the tender process. In early May, Senator Collins began discussions with his Department about setting up an inquiry. On 27 May, Senator Cook took over the portfolio. On 3 June, the Public Works Committee tabled its report and recommended an inquiry be held into the awarding of the contract to Thomson. On 11 July, the inquiry started.

I think they could well be. Are there questions about the actions of Mr Baldwin and Dr Edwards, for example?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats believe that there is a strong case that the two executives most responsible for this debacle, Mr Baldwin and Dr Edwards, should be dismissed immediately. We think it is inconceivable that Hughes could have any confidence in the re-run tender process if those two officials are reinstated. There is also sufficient evidence to warrant a review of the appointment of the Chairman and the Deputy Chairman, Mr Ted Butcher and Mr Henry Bosch. In our view, they oversaw a clearly flawed process and appeared to us not to properly and independently question the judgment and action of the two senior executives in question, Mr Baldwin and Dr Edwards. Mr Butcher is, after all, the Chairman of the National Rail Corporation as well as the Civil Aviation Authority. He surely must take responsibility for the haphazard and hasty sequence of events leading to the decision to favour Thomson over Hughes. His position in the NRC is critical to the national interest, and reassurance as to his judgment and determination to act is needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to one of Senator Macdonald's interjections, I said that what has happened here raises the big question of the role of GBEs and the way in which this Government, with the support of the Opposition, which said, `Yes, yes, corporatise; you must corporatise; it is not as good as privatising, but it is a good first step along the road'. So it raises the question of the role of GBEs, their relationship with government, and the notion of what `arm's length' should mean in relation to GBEs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As I understand it, Mr Macphee said that he felt that the Chief Executive and the board either did not know or did not properly understand the Civil Aviation Act, which established the CAA, in that it seemed to him that they interpreted that Act to mean that the sole purpose of the CAA was to operate on a commercial basis. Again, I think the assumption is that the relationship between government and GBEs&mdash;in this case, the Civil Aviation Authority&mdash;was akin to one between a board and shareholders. But the Democrats would argue strongly that because the Government has ownership, a more direct sense of control and responsibility is required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the Government has many government business enterprises under its authority, we think that&mdash;it is the old line: horses for courses&mdash;there are some which quite obviously the Government may wish to say have a primary objective of operating commercially. But, quite clearly, there are others whose prime consideration is the purpose of delivering public good. Chapter 2, on page 11 of Mr Macphee's report, quite clearly specifies:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Board of the CAA has the purposes:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a)to decide the objectives, strategies and policies to be followed by the Authority; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b)to ensure that the Authority performs its functions in a proper, efficient and economical manner. </PARA>
<PARA>This does not mean that its sole objective is to operate on a commercial basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Macphee also suggested that there were other considerations that governments ought to have in mind. On page 13 he lists an indicative and far from exhaustive list of the possible objectives of the Government to be met by the CAA beyond the efficient production of the specified products of the CAA. In the first instance Mr Macphee talks about the `provision of safety in relation to civil aviation'. He talks about `artificial deterrents to demand for or supply of civil aviation'. The first one is quite clearly a public good. The second one he describes as `to reduce the incidence and therefore cost of externalities'. He also talks about assistance to Australian industry to meet the wider policy objectives of producing a portfolio of goods and services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we debated this matter a couple of years ago, we talked about what a wonderful delivery of services we were going to get from this corporatised CAA. I think we should look again. We should say, `It has failed to deliver'. In one sense, we have a GBE which clearly seems to be ignoring its purpose and its major considerations beyond commerciality. The Government needs to take a good, long and hard look at the way the CAA Board is interpreting the Act which establishes it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask again: what is the point of having corporatisation if we are just going to have a board at arm's length making these sorts of decisions, costing this amount of money for a review and a government which stands back?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There is no doubt that the Macphee report is an important document. As I say, the dealing with the effects of that report has some time to run and is not yet complete. One of the key issues, until the report has been properly dealt with and completed, is the morale and integrity of the CAA and its ability to oversee air safety and regulation in Australia. Quite clearly, when a report of this character is tabled, it must have a damaging impact on morale. I think we ought not add to that unnecessarily. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other reason I rise, however, is that I do not want to see an injustice done and, if this motion were carried, I think an injustice would be done to my colleague Senator Collins.

I think these four points put beyond question that this motion should not succeed in the event it is not withdrawn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first is the logistical possibilities of the practical life of government; that is, the time-line between the critical decisions. The Democrats have just put down what appears to me to be about the right timetable, and I think it can be seen that the Government moved with haste and propriety and dealt with this issue promptly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point I make relates to the charter given to the independent inquirer, Mr Macphee. He had, to put it in the colloquial, `open slather'. He was properly able to report on any matter that engaged his attention about this issue, and he did so. He was invited to report the brutal truth of the circumstances as he found them. He entered no finding against Senator Collins, nor did he enter a finding against the board, but he did enter a finding against the officers of the Civil Aviation Authority. I think that has to be respected because, if Mr Macphee believed that there was some improper conduct by the Minister, his charter was that he would report that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is true that Mr Macphee&mdash;and certainly this is one of the reasons why I thought he was an appropriate choice for the inquiry&mdash;is widely regarded as an iconoclastic individual, able to withstand criticism if he makes unpopular decisions. If his decision and finding in this case were unpopular with us as a Government, I do not think that would deter him from making them. The fact that he did not and that he has that reputation I think has to be respected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point is the chain of responsibility which  comes in for some discussion in the report. The chain of responsibility is from the Authority to the board to the Minister. The board is responsible, on behalf of the Authority, to the Minister. The proper connection is the chairman of the board to the Minister. The debate in the report is about other lines of authority to the Parliament, and I think those observations are properly drawn in the report. However, I think to admonish the Minister for the conduct of the officers ignores the chain of command, and that is not appropriate in logic or in fact in these circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth point that I make is that neither I nor Senator Collins had very much warning that our portfolio arrangements were to be changed; I certainly did not and I am pretty sure neither did Senator Collins. This Senate, above all chambers in Australia, is probably very familiar with the cause and effect of the circumstance of the resignation of the then Minister, Senator Richardson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As someone who, according to the pecking order, has been so-called promoted from one portfolio to another, a Minister always leaves a portfolio to take on newer and higher responsibilities with some element of regret. One has regret because any Minister worth his salt, on whatever side of the political fence, commits himself to a program of involvement with his portfolio. If one is called to other duties unexpectedly and that tenure is truncated, one cannot complete projects that have been running&mdash;projects which are important and in which as Minister one has invested effort and time. Someone then comes in and then completes those projects. In some cases those concerned get criticised and wear the blame for doing what one would have done, and in other cases they get the praise and take the credit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am absolutely certain in my mind that had there not been a change in portfolio responsibility from Senator Collins to me, there would have been in any case, under Senator Collins's stewardship, an independent inquiry of the sort that we have had. Not only am I confident about that but when the baton changed from Senator Collins to me, as a tyro Minister, it was incumbent on me, as I saw it, to consult deeply with Senator Collins about some of these transitional managerial issues. I did this on the subject of the inquiry; the appointment of the inquirer; the inquiry's terms of reference to the inquiry; on the licence the inquirer would have; and on the issue, which was a critical one at the time, as to whether the process of the Thomson bid should be discontinued while the inquiry was being conducted. Although Ministers take responsibility for their own decisions, I leant heavily on the crutch of Senator Collins's advice and counsel in those matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I regard the transition in portfolio responsibility from him to me as seamless and without any dislocative break between portfolio responsibilities, as any government would want to see happen when ministerial responsibilities are changed. For those four reasons, I ask the Opposition to consider the withdrawal of this motion; if it does not, I ask the Senate to defeat it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;In closing the debate, I will deal with the speakers in the debate in inverse order. It is not possible for the Senate to accept the plea of the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Cook) to withdraw this motion. The debate has clearly demonstrated beyond any shadow of doubt, that let alone reasonable doubt, Senator Collins is guilty of the charge that he failed to responsibly discharge the duties vested in him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened with great interest to Senator Cook, but as with so many other speakers in this debate he failed to deal with the issue before the Chair. This is not a debate about how the Department of Shipping and Aviation Support or the Civil Aviation Authority operate or anything like that. The debate is about what Senator Collins did or did not do as a matter of fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree very much with Senator Cook's plea that the morale of the Department should not be damaged. But as someone who has known the Department intimately for 20 or 30 years, I can tell honourable senators that the morale is very badly damaged at the present time. While any change in morale is to be deplored, it is a matter of slight degree that the morale is worse today than it was yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to thank the Democrats for their nice, sensitive support for the Government once more. It must be about 40 years since someone tried to teach me any Latin. But I still remember those great buildings, in which the AMP invested its funds in all the country towns, with the statue on the top and a slogan underneath: "Amicus certus in re incerta cernitur"&mdash;which, to my distant Latin thinking, means `a certain friend in uncertain times'. Politics is a matter of shifting loyalties, but at least the Labor Party has the great luxury&mdash;a luxury that I do not think any other party in politics has enjoyed in the Australian Parliament&mdash;of knowing that it does not matter how black the night, the Democrats are there plodding along loyally, uncritically, giving it unfailing support. It just keeps on and on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not wish to dignify with respectability the lightweight contribution of the Democrats by dissecting it in detail, but wish merely to say that great play was made by Senator Kernot of the fact that because the Government had reacted in five or six months, it had acted with great expedition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Oh, six weeks. Well, that makes Senator Kernot's case even worse. I just happen to have reasonably good briefs with me when I move on something, and all these pages deal with the chronology of the TAAATS contract.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find that the leading question was asked by me on 10 September 1991. I realise from Senator Kernot's prognostications on the economic scene that she does not share the great distinction in mathematics that a lot of us in this chamber have, but I think it is rather appalling to claim that 10 September 1991 was only six weeks before the inquiry was initiated. For the rest of her time we had a discourse about GBEs and other irrelevances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point at issue is that Senator Collins, in his own speech in his own defence, failed to establish that he had effectively coped with the abundant evidence that was given that things were seriously wrong in the Authority. He talked about the instructions he gave to the board on numerous occasions. With the greatest of respect, this was utterly irrelevant and had nothing to do with the motion. He talked about direct interference&mdash;how he would not dare interfere in a commercial outcome. Again, this had nothing to do with the motion before the Chair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Collins never had the courage to take the charge on and defend himself against it. The charge is that when he was faced with overwhelming evidence that the process by which the outcome of a major commercial contract was being grossly distorted, and being conducted in an improper and incompetent way, he did nothing about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts speak for themselves. The chronology of the events speaks for itself. The moment Senator Cook came in, metaphorically, we had an inquiry. Senator Collins did nothing. I want to quote from chapter 11 of the report. At page 88 the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under no test of fair play or professional competence could the methods of inquiry or the quality of the conclusions&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the report is talking here about the TAAATS contract&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">during the post December 1991 phase be regarded as being adequate.</PARA>
<PARA>That sums it up. That was the point that honourable senators on both sides of the Parliament were making. The process was fatally flawed. That was found to be a matter of fact by the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are saying that Senator Collins failed to listen to the critics of the program. He failed to intercept and take the appropriate action. If he had done so, the Australian public would have been saved a great deal of trauma, hurt and expense. That is why he is negligent in the discharge of his duties. That is why today we unhesitatingly find him guilty of not discharging the responsibilities that are vested in him as a Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The situation in Somalia is an international tragedy. Devastating famine, factional conflict and gang warfare have already taken the lives of an estimated 250,000 Somalis. Two million more are assessed to be at immediate risk of starvation. Despite the chaos and lawlessness, Australian and other international non-government organisations have displayed remarkable courage in and dedication to getting food and medicine to the starving. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said, the Australian community has been rightly proud of the efforts of these groups.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian community has also demonstrated extraordinary compassion and generosity in responding to the human tragedy of Somalia. Public appeals in Australia have now raised over $11m for Somalia and government has contributed direct humanitarian assistance to Somalia of some $8.5m so far this calendar year. Last weekend, the Australian people donated more than $600,000 to appeals for Somalia and other drought and famine stricken countries in Africa.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United Nations Security Council, in resolution 751, established a peacekeeping operation, UNOSOM, in April of this year in order to facilitate humanitarian relief to Somalia. UNOSOM, however, has proved unable to create the necessary peaceful environment to meet its prime objective of allowing for the provision of urgent humanitarian assistance. The offer by President Bush to provide substantial US troops to a new international coalition to enforce peace in Somalia was therefore welcomed by the international community. It offered the opportunity to break the impasse that had developed. Food donated by the international community was being plundered by armed gangs or had to remain in warehouses because safe passage could not be guaranteed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 3 December, the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 794 which called for the establishment as soon as possible of a secure environment for humanitarian relief in Somalia. As the Secretary General of the United Nations Boutros-Ghali said in a message to the people of Somalia, the United Nations is taking action in Somalia in the cause of security, humanitarian relief and political reconciliation. The United Nations intends to restore the hope of the Somali people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The resolution invited member states to contribute to the multinational force. In response to that resolution and at the invitation of the United States, the Government decided to contribute an infantry battalion group to the US led international coalition enforcement operation. Australia will join at least 20 other nations in the international coalition. The Australian battalion group is based on the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, from Townsville. It is part of the ADF's operational deployment force. The group will consist of 900 personnel and will include four rifle companies, a reduced squadron of 30 armoured personnel carriers, and logistic and engineer support elements. The Australian contingent will be commanded by Colonel Bill Mellor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The battalion group is the minimum sized unit that can fully support and protect itself and can readily integrate with the coalition forces. Possible tasks for the battalion group could include the security of major airfields, sea ports, key installations, food distribution points and oversighting relief operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has decided that the battalion group will be provided for 17 weeks. This timing has been made clear to our partners in the operation who have welcomed our offer. The estimated additional cost for the 17 week deployment is $19.557m. The coalition force will be United States led with the operational control of Australian forces delegated to the combined task force commander, but will remain under national command. These command and control arrangements are consistent with past combined operations, including the Gulf war. Rules of engagement are being developed in close consultation with the coalition and will be approved by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the Australian contingent will have the right to protect themselves, if threatened, at all times. They will be armed with their normal complement of infantry small arms and weapons, but I have to say that this operation will entail risks. As I informed the Senate on 15 November, a careful assessment of the security situation has been undertaken by the intelligence agencies and considered by government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the coalition does not involve itself in disarming the Somali factions, the threat assessment for our troops will be medium to high. If, however, the task involves disarming the factions, the risk would be high to very high. No final decision has been taken by the UN on disarming Somalis. However, as I told the Senate, if the follow-on UNOSOM operation is to be successful, some attempt must be made to disarm the bands. Security resolution 794 authorises all necessary means to establish as soon as possible a secure environment for humanitarian relief operations in Somalia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main body of Australian troops will arrive in Somalia by mid-January 1993. A small reconnaissance party will leave for Somalia in the next few days with an advance party departing in early January. Equipment and vehicles for the contingent will be transported by HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Jervis Bay</EMPHASIS> and HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tobruk</EMPHASIS> to arrive at approximately the same time as the main body of troops. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the highest priority for the coalition is to allow food and relief to be brought to the starving Somalis. The coalition's other major task will be to create an environment in which the UN peacekeeping operation, UNOSOM, can take over and operate in a more secure and stable environment. Australia will continue to participate in the UNOSOM operation and will expand the size of the movement control unit, which we have already committed, from 30 to 45 personnel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our contribution to Operation Restore Hope will be the largest commitment of Australian ground forces overseas in the last 20 years. It increases sharply our total contribution to UN mandated peacekeeping and other operations around the world. These contributions are a clear demonstration of Australia's support in ensuring that the United Nations is able to respond effectively to major humanitarian and security challenges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure all honourable senators will join with me in expressing their support for and confidence in those men and women who are going to be deployed to Somalia. They carry with them the very proud traditions of the Australian defence forces. Our thoughts are with them and their families as they prepare for this important task. We do look forward to welcoming them home at the conclusion of their deployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the remaining time I have I will address some of the issues that have already been raised. Dr Hewson raised three issues in the other place. He asked whether the Opposition&mdash;and I assume other parliamentarians&mdash;could be kept abreast of the threat assessment in this area. The answer to that is an unequivocal yes. Secondly, the question of whether there would be cuts in the Defence budget to fund this operation was raised. The additional $19.557m is supplemented to the Defence budget, so no other capability will be reduced because of this commitment. Thirdly, Dr Hewson slightly misinterpreted the question of 17 weeks when he said 17 weeks from today. It will be 17 weeks from the date of deployment. I am not saying that Dr Hewson in any way deliberately misinterpreted this, but I thought that I would put the record straight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, Senator Powell was kind enough to show me a copy of an amendment to this motion that she believed was necessary. Having negotiated a motion that everyone agreed to, I would not accept the amendment, but I have expressed in my speech the sentiments that would be reflected in that amendment. It is now our role as a partner in this matter to put our point of view. If that point of view prevails, we will certainly be in that situation. If it does not, we cannot unilaterally do that sort of thing without the help of our coalition parties. I understand that there is virtually uniform, if not uniform, support for this motion and I commend it to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition is pleased to support the Government's decision in this instance and to support the motion on Somalia that is before the Senate today. Obviously, the decision to commit Australian forces overseas is one that would never be taken without very careful consideration. We accept that the Government has exercised due care in addressing the decision in this instance. Likewise, our support would never be given without very careful thought.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is occurring in Somalia is a human tragedy of enormous consequences. No doubt it has happened before, but it is somewhat exciting that for the first time the international community is prepared, as an international community, to help in a situation such as this, where law and order has totally broken down and where the consequences of that are mass starvation and loss of life. Nevertheless, the decision of the international community to intervene in the internal affairs of a country is a big step for the UN to take, even though the humanitarian cause is no doubt just. There will be those&mdash;and it is sensible&mdash;who have some caution about what type of precedent is being created. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember addressing a United Nations Association conference in Canberra about 18 months ago. I said that in the circumstances of the new world order I thought the international community should have the courage to intervene in exceptional circumstances. I did not have the benefit of wisdom to know the tragedy that was going to unfold in Somalia. But the one instance that immediately comes to mind is when the Kurds were bombed with poisoned gas in Iraq a few years ago. The international community stood back embarrassed but not feeling that there was any capacity to intervene in such horrendous circumstances. As part of an international community, we have now reached a new maturity and confidence that will dissuade dictators and warlords from such appalling conduct their citizens in the future in relation to their citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am, therefore, pleased that the international community has shown this courage on this occasion. Whilst stating the obvious caution that it must be a humanitarian cause of unambiguous demand and severe consequence, nevertheless, we are pleased that the precedent has been set. We hope that it will help contribute to a more stable and peaceful world in the future not only in relation to conflicts between states but conflicts now within states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the United States, as I did in relation to the Gulf war. It should be mentioned again that the US is prepared to show a leadership which in many ways only the US really can show. As the one superpower in the world, it has a major responsibility. I hope that it will continue to exercise that responsibility under President-elect Clinton. In my view, his predecessor has shown an international leadership that is worthy of commendation. We commended him during the Gulf war and I do again in these different circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian commitment to a force that will be operationally headed by the United States might cause some concern, but not to me. It seems to me to be a sensible command relationship in these difficult circumstances. It might be that one day in the future the international community will reach yet another level of confidence when it is able to put large forces such as this into an operation under a UN command. Clearly, the UN charter provides for this, but that is another stage of confidence in an operation of this size that is yet to be reached. We are gradually heading in that direction, and this is a step along the road. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficult question is that of disarming the heavily armed young men. As the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) has said, there are clear risks associated with that. But I join with the Minister and Senator Powell, through the sentiment that she has put in her amendment&mdash;which I respectfully suggest is probably unnecessary today, provided that the sentiment is expressed&mdash;that the objective of providing humanitarian relief will only permit a long term benefit if peace and stability can be restored. I cannot see how peace and stability will be restored without an effort in disarming the thugs, gangs and warlords. Therefore, it seems to me to be a necessary, logical step towards what we know is the ultimate objective of UNOSOM and Operation Restore Hope, which is to achieve peace and stability within Somalia for the benefit of the Somali people. I think this step is necessary, and this seems to be the force that is most appropriate to maximise the potential for UNOSOM to achieve its objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian armed forces have a proud record in peacekeeping work. I have visited them throughout the world, most recently in Cambodia. I said on a recent occasion that they are clearly a credit to Australia in Cambodia as they have been wherever they have served in these roles. I am sure that they will leave Somalia with Australia's reputation further enhanced as a result of their contribution. However, there are risks associated with this action. It is necessary for us to recognise them and to express our appreciation that Australian forces are prepared, under the Australian flag, to serve the international community in this way but, nevertheless, at risk to themselves. Their families make just as great a commitment as the men and women who go into the field in this task. We wish them well in what is a difficult task but a good cause. We trust that they will all return safely and we want them to go knowing that they have the full confidence and support of this Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats are very pleased to support this motion before the Senate in its entirety. The imminent deployment of Australian troops to Somalia is a welcome and necessary response to a grave humanitarian crisis. As we all know, Somalians have died and are continuing to die in appalling numbers. Many are dying because relief operations are being disrupted by gangs of armed thugs. This is an intolerable situation and it has been absolutely clear for some time that armed intervention is the only way of maximising the reach of emergency food aid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for this reason that the United States, to its credit, offered to lead what can perhaps be called a peace enforcement operation&mdash;dubbed Operation Restore Hope. The United Nations Security Council, in its resolution 794 adopted unanimously on 3 December 1992, accepted the offer and laid the legal foundations for armed intervention in accordance with chapter 7 of the UN charter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats support the Security Council resolution and the Australian Government's decision to contribute troops to the operation which is now under way. We particularly endorse the final part of the motion before the Senate expressing full confidence in and support for the men and women of the Australian Defence Force who are being deployed to Somalia and very much look forward to their safe return. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recently visited Australian troops in Cambodia in both Phnom Penh and in Battambang and I was very impressed by their dedication to duty and the way they are very much respected by the other troops in Cambodia. I believe we will do the same excellent job in Somalia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats also endorse the Government's view that disarmament of the waring factions should be a top priority of this operation. There has been a difference of opinion between the United States and the UN Secretary-General, Boutros-Ghali, on this point and we are persuaded to the Secretary-General's position. Clearly, total disarmament is an ideal and it cannot be achieved. Maximum disarmament must be pursued for the very obvious reason that the likelihood of a return to anarchy and violence after the troops' withdrawal will be proportional to the number of weapons available to renegade gangs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be naive to assume that this operation is guaranteed to succeed. Intervention of this nature by the UN breaks new ground, and as the situation in Cambodia makes clear there is much still to be learned, but the uncertainties are no excuse for inaction. The Democrats welcome the deployment of Australian forces not only because of the potential to alleviate the desperate privations to which so many Somalians are subject; we also welcome it as evidence of an increasing willingness on the part of the world community to collectively enforce humanitarian norms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The size of Australia's deployment to Somalia is a welcome demonstration that this Government is prepared to give more than token support for the new ideals now being put into practice by the United Nations. Our contributions to this force, to the unprecedented operation now occurring in Cambodia and to other contingents scattered around the world are ample evidence of that commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats note the concerns of those who argue that these deployments weaken our capacity to respond to developments in our own region. There is clearly a balance to be struck, but the general absence of security concerns in our region suggest to us that the risks are not that high. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats are well aware that our support for this operation and for the operation in Cambodia will be compared with our opposition to the Gulf war. I would like to spend a little time on this comparison, because it goes to the heart of our concept of the new world order. There are several critical differences between Operation Restore Hope and Operation Desert Storm on which our support for the Somalian deployment is based. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, the United Nations endorsement of the Gulf war was reluctant and a mere formality. Had no endorsement been forthcoming, the war would have occurred anyway. While the size of the United States Somalian deployment makes it practical for the US to maintain operational control of the forces there, it is quite obvious from resolution 794 and surrounding events that the United Nations is firmly in control of this initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Second, the Gulf war would not have taken place had the United States national interests not been threatened. Despite all the denials, the Gulf war was an oil war first and foremost. The Somalian operation by contrast is motivated by humanitarian concerns which are shared far more equally by the international community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Third, the Gulf war was a humanitarian disaster. The Iraqis who could not be held responsible for the excesses of their dictatorial leader were made to suffer in order to liberate Iraq's victims in Kuwait. It is now clear that the predominant victims of the war have been Iraqi children under the age of five, more than 100,000 of whom have died through a combination of malnourishment and poor sanitation. Serious human rights abuses have occurred since the restoration to power of the Kuwaiti royal family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Somalia by contrast there is an excellent chance that significant humanitarian gains will be achieved. There is one common thread running through the Gulf war and the Somalian disaster which should give the world community and our Government food for thought. The seeds of the Gulf war were sown by a myriad of nations, east and west, which sold or donated arms to Iraq to the point where it became a major threat to Middle East security. The full extent of that stupid and short-sighted traffic in weapons is still being exposed in Britain, the United States and elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The destruction of Somalia had its roots in the tug of war for influence between the United States and the Soviet Union, as it then was. Somalian dictatorships were variously backed by the superpowers. A protracted war of insurgency and violent counterinsurgency during the rule of the dictator, Siad Barre, culminated in his downfall and the final dissent into anarchy&mdash;all fuelled by imported weapons and the paralysed unwillingness of the United Nations to intervene. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1989-90, even the Hawke Government approved the sale of two Strikemaster aircraft to the Barre regime which had a counterinsurgency squadron employed against its own people. Fortunately, that sale did not proceed for commercial reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already referred to the heartening change in the United Nations role in enforcing humanitarian norms. It is regrettable that this willingness to take new directions does not extend to restraining the international trade in arms. It is well documented that the flow of arms into the Middle East is continuing unabated, raising grave concerns about the military potential of Iran and Syria and making a future conflagration all the more likely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have already said, a major priority of the United Nations operation in Somalia must be the disarmament of the armed gangs which are now compounding the misery of the Somalian people. It is equally important that future flows of arms into Somalia be made as difficult as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of that, the Democrats support Senator Powell's proposed amendment. We believe disarming the rebel clans is a most necessary part of this process. I thank Senator Ray for his offer to keep parliamentarians informed of the process of Operation Restore Hope and I look forward to receiving information as it becomes available. The Democrats strongly support Australia's contribution to this important attempt to alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Somalia. We support the motion. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I briefly reiterate the point made by Senator Bourne that all of us internationally need to pause for thought about the arms trade which has fuelled the warlords in Somalia, as indeed it has fuelled other conflicts and continues to do so around the world.

It could demonstrate a basis for the resolution of conflict throughout the country. Given that there needs to be a local solution, this conference might present a very good model.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to make some brief comments on the motion moved by the Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Ray, over Australia's participation in the United Nations peacekeeping operation in Somalia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The use of Australian troops for the humanitarian aims of the operation marks a significant and historic point. Senator Chris Schacht spoke of human rights as an international concern in launching the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade report on Australia's role in promoting human rights. It is appropriate that we are participating in an international peacekeeping force which has the positive and worthy purpose of humanitarian concern. Therefore, I support the expression and spirit of this motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I also remain very ambivalent about Australia's involvement in the peacekeeping force because of the emphasis placed on suppressing and disarming warring parties well in advance of food arriving to help the starving people in Somalia. I make that point in relation to the arrival of quite a massive military force in a particular location in Somalia, as happened today, with the news that food would be coming on the weekend. While I realise that it might have quite complicated logistic implications to combine those two, I believe a true message of humanitarian aid which is being enforced and secured by military assistance needs to be expressed together rather than separately. There is a danger that a double message may go to local Somali people as well as to other nations in similar situations, such as Mozambique&mdash;that is, `We will conquer first before we feed you'. It is very important that those two aims are not seen to be separate in the light of the suffering of the people we are seeking to aid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the one hand, the American commanders appear to be saying that their role is to ensure that food gets to the hungry&mdash;something we cannot argue with, although we may not like the measures which are necessary to achieve that goal in those dire circumstances&mdash;and then they will leave. Some have suggested that the United States will leave behind a well-fed, as well as well-armed, Somalia. The United Nations leadership, however, wants the US to disarm the countryside and the towns before getting the food through. While I agree with the concerns expressed by Senator Powell and by Senator Bourne on behalf of the Democrats, I feel there is a danger in the separation of military force from the food aid because it may send a message that military involvement is more important here. That disarmament of necessity would involve a much greater level of military action and the use of force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This confusion, if that is not too strong a word, is coming through in the Australian part of the operation too. We hear that the Australian Government is supportive of the United Nations' position, while it acknowledges that this would place the troops in greater danger, as mentioned in the AAP news story of 15 December. However, the commander of the Australian force says that the troops will be under American command on a day-to-day basis. Yesterday, 16 December, AAP news quotes Colonel Bill Mellor as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Americans will provide operational command. They will specifically task the battalion on a day-to-day basis.</PARA>
<PARA>Colonel Mellor went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The aim of the enforcement operation is to provide security for the delivery of humanitarian assistance&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>thus clearly showing the divergence in the agenda. We must remember that pre-1977, the USSR, and post-1977, the USA, bear considerable responsibility for the present condition of Somalia and the presence of the very arms that the warlords have been using in their fighting. The long term future of a country where quite massive intervention is required leaves the very open question: how does this affect the local people and their own efforts to bring about long term sustainable development?  Where does this put the status of an African-Somalian solution?

<PARA>The 1991-92 annual report of the Department of Tourism records 2.3 million visitors to Australia in that period. The report is interesting reading. It shows that since 1985&mdash;seven years ago&mdash;the number of inbound tourists to Australia has doubled. The target for the year 2000 is 6 1/2 million visitors to Australia from overseas every year. The report makes it very clear that export earnings from tourism are now worth $8.2 billion annually to the Australian economy. That figure rivals the total annual proceeds from sales of some of our traditional commodities to other countries. The tourism sector contributes 450,000 jobs to the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important to note that this report states that `international tourism is increasingly competitive'. In that context we have to look at the potential effect of a goods and services tax on the Australian tourism sector. The reality is&mdash;and the studies show it&mdash;that a goods and services tax would severely damage the Australian international tourism industry. In this context I refer to a report done by the independent Public Service Department of the Treasury, which has looked at the potential impact of a goods and services tax on tourism. The report identified a cost increase of 13 per cent for accommodation as a result of a goods and services tax. Dr Hewson's proposed goods and services tax would add 13 per cent to accommodation costs in tourism. If ever implemented, it would add 12 per cent to the cost of travel by aircraft or other means of transport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that such a tax would seriously reduce Australia's relative price advantage for international tourists. Australia would become a more expensive destination for overseas tourists compared with other countries. If implemented, the goods and services tax would narrow our cost advantage compared with other countries. The reality is that tourist brochures published overseas would record higher prices for tours and holiday packages to Australia. Prices in Australia would rise while prices in other countries were relatively constant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is a long haul destination for tourists. Tourism is a very price sensitive commodity and anything in the form of a goods and services tax, for example, which added to the cost of tourism would reduce competitiveness and tend to reduce the demand for tourism to Australia because Australia would become less competitive. A crazy policy is being put forward by the Opposition in this country; it is proposing to implement a goods and services tax on a key export earner, a major generator of foreign exchange for Australia. International tourism is now worth over $8,000m annually to Australia and the Opposition has a nonsensical policy which would add costs to that industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that Opposition spokespersons in this place repeatedly claim that in the so-called Fightback package there would be offsets for the tourism industry because things like payroll tax would be abolished. The reality is that 85 per cent of the businesses in the tourism sector do not pay payroll tax now because there is an exemption from payroll tax for small businesses. So only 15 per cent of the producers in the industry pay payroll tax. Therefore, the 85 per cent who do not pay payroll tax cannot benefit from any reduction in it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Enormous damage would be done to tourism by the Opposition's crazy policy that will tax this export industry. When Dr Hewson makes his announcement tomorrow, I call on him to exempt international tourism from the goods and services tax. He must do that. International tourism is a major generator of foreign exchange for the Australian balance of payments. It is one way we can earn hard currency. Dr Hewson must avoid damaging this major industry by exempting tourism from a goods and services tax. </PARA>

<PARA>I want to briefly address the annual report of the Tobacco Research and Development Council in order to say something that I have said many times in the past; that is, that this Government has been prepared to ban tobacco advertising in Australia, except in respect of certain favoured events which will bring in the major tobacco sponsorship to Australia. I refer, of course, to the Adelaide Grand Prix, Eastern Creek, Mt Panorama and those sorts of things. What sticks in my throat is the fact that this Government puts $413,000 from this year's Budget into tobacco research. While it may be a legal crop to grow and a legal product to sell, this Government has banned the advertising of it. We have supported that. My colleague Senator Herron knows far better than I do the effects of tobacco advertising. But I believe that if we are to ban tobacco advertising we should ban it completely; we should not ban it very selectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I stood up to point out the Government's double standards not only on advertising but also in respect of the tobacco industry in that the Government gave it $413,000 out of Consolidated Revenue. It is not a matter of giving back to the industry funds that it had contributed through being levied at the rate of .05 per cent of its gross production. As far as I am concerned, these are the industry's own funds and the Government is merely giving back that money in order for it to be used. But in this year's Budget $413,000 is provided for tobacco research. If the use of tobacco is so bad&mdash;and I believe that it is; Senator Herron, an eminent surgeon from Brisbane&mdash;</PARA>

Indeed, my mother-in-law died of passive smoking, I believe. But here we have a double standard in that the Government puts $413,000 into tobacco research at the same time as running around banning tobacco advertising. This Government&mdash;and any future government&mdash;has to address that. The Government should stay with one standard rather than run with the two. The Government has to make up its mind whether the tobacco industry is needed in Australia and whether it should be encouraged in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At an Estimates Committee hearing when I asked a question on this matter of Senator Cook he said that tobacco was a valuable export crop for Australia. If it is, the Government should be doing something different in regard to tobacco advertising. The Government is doing the right thing on tobacco advertising as long as it is doing the same thing right across the board&mdash;but if smoking is so unhealthy it should not be subsidising or paying money for research for the continuation of growing tobacco.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the annual report for 1991-92 of the Australian Sports Drug Agency, I commence by congratulating the Agency on an excellent report. It is not without significance that the report observes that the Secretary of the Senate Committee that deals with annual reports informed the Agency that its annual report for 1990-91 was used as a model for other authorities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very comprehensive report and I will refer to just one or two matters in it. First of all, I take this opportunity to congratulate the Chief Executive of ASDA, Steve Haynes, on his award of best administrator at the recent Confederation of Australian Sports awards in Melbourne. I think that was a reflection not only of his excellent administrative capacity but also on the contribution that he is making to sport in Australia generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I observe that the report draws to our attention that litigation is presently taking place between Martin Vinnicombe and the Agency. One of the difficulties confronting sporting associations and authorities is that, notwithstanding the fact that athletes may be detected for having ingested performance drugs of a bad nature for which they should be suspended from competition, they have on a number of occasions been able to resort to the courts and have their ban overturned on appeal. The difficulty in some cases is that a number of the sporting authorities simply do not have the funding available to them to properly and adequately defend the original administrative requirements and decision. I note that an American athlete named Reynolds, commonly known as Butch Reynolds, who was detected for cheating has now sued the International Amateur Athletic Association for several million dollars. That just shows the difficulty that sports officials and administrators have in ensuring that the provisions are correct in order to enable them to properly eliminate the cheats in sport, of which Mr Reynolds, of course, is one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer also to appendix 12 of the report which draws to our attention the matter of clenbuterol. This is a drug which is used by asthmatics. It is in the beta category and it is also an anabolic agent. A number of athletes have used clenbuterol because they believed that it was not particularly proscribed on the IOC doping list. However, the IOC practice of including `and related substances' means that that possible loophole does not exist. However, it is not without significance that there is at least one Australian athlete who has been detected as positive for using clenbuterol for the purpose of enhancing his performance who is now appealing his suspension. I suspect that that will embroil Athletics Australia in very large costs. It is a pity that the IOC did not take up the matter of clenbuterol earlier so as to clarify the situation, because it was drawn to its attention by the Canadian drug agency. However, the IOC did absolutely nothing about it for something like 18 months. Now various sporting bodies around the world find themselves confronted with that difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by quickly drawing to the Senate's attention appendix 3, which refers to our memorandum of understanding with Canada and the United Kingdom concerning reciprocal development and enforcement of measures against doping in sport. I can only say that until such time as we have arrangements of that nature including China, America and all the European countries, we will not eliminate the cheating at the Olympic Games and our own Australian athletes will continue to be disadvantaged, given that we have the most rigid regime in the world. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I draw attention to appendix 8 of this report on the Australian Sports Drug Agency, which outlines the difference between the States in the manner of applying penalties for the taking of anabolic steroids. It is quite remarkable that the Australian Capital Territory has a very low level of penalty and very moderate laws to discourage people from taking anabolic steroids. It really is quite striking that in the Territory in which the Federal Parliament exists, and where there is a determined bipartisan approach against the taking of steroids, we have an administration that appears to take a remarkably lenient view.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, this question appears in appendix 8:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. Is it an offence for unauthorised supply of anabolic steroids through pharmacies?</PARA>
<PARA>We see that in Tasmania and New South Wales, there is a $2,000 fine&mdash;or in New South Wales, two years gaol. In Queensland, the fine is $1,200. In Victoria it is $5,000. In Western Australia it is $100,000 or 25 years gaol. In the ACT it is $200. That is disgraceful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further question is stated in appendix 8:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.A) Is it a requirement that a pharmacist is required to keep a record of all prescrip. dispensed?</PARA>
<PARA>In the ACT the fine for not doing so is $40. In Victoria, it is $5,000 or 12 months in gaol. In New South Wales it is $800 or six months in gaol. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. Are all wholesalers of veterinary and human scheduled products licensed? B) Veterinary products?</PARA>
<PARA>I mention veterinary products because many drug takers appear to be taking them. In all States, it is required that they be licensed. In the ACT, the fine for not being so is $200. In Western Australia it is $100,000 or 25 years gaol. In Queensland it is $1,200. In Victoria it is $2,000. Question No. 4 of appendix 8 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. Is it a requirement of the wholesale licence that supply of scheduled products can only be to a licence or permit holder?</PARA>
<PARA>Breaching that brings about a fine of $1,200 in Queensland, $2,000 in Victoria, $100,000 or 25 years gaol in Western Australia&mdash;and in the ACT, $200. It seems to me that this sort of thing is totally unacceptable, particularly when we come to question No. 7:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7. Is possession of S4 substances such as anabolic steroids an offence?</PARA>
<PARA>In every State and Territory of this nation except the ACT, it is an offence. Something has to be done about this.

I have taken up one minute of my precious five minutes to bring out the absurdity of this process, but this document is of very major significance. I repeat that the document concerns the operations of the registered health benefits organisations&mdash;the Private Health Insurance Administration Council. I quote from the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proportion of the population covered by private health insurance continues to decline. Over the year the privately insured proportion of the Australian population fell from 43.7% at the end of June 1991 to 40.9% at the end of June 1992. The State which sustained the largest decline was Victoria which fell from 47.9% to 42.9% (5% points) over the year. All States recorded declines with the smallest decline occurring in Western Australia (0.5% points). . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The industry has lost approximately 119,000 members Australia wide over the year, with Victoria accounting for slightly more than half of the loss. . . </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The significance of the coverage of the Australian population in looking after its health care is enormous.

He was not covered and then he got the hospital bill and did not pay it. Those who are not privately insured and are prepared to pay the bill account for 10 per cent of the population.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General's Report No. 17 of 1992-93 on medifraud and excessive servicing is a particularly significant report, one that we have been waiting on for a very long time. The first I heard about the investigation into medifraud was some three or four months ago and it has taken a considerable length of time to actually drag, reef and haul out of the Government the information that is now contained in the Auditor-General's report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very sad state of affairs, because what we have really found is that the recommendations that were put to the Health Insurance Commission over 10 years ago have been almost totally and utterly ignored. We have actually seen in the past year, 1991-92, around $4.6 billion of Medicare fraud. One can only imagine what the unemployed could do in terms of job creation with $4.6 billion. Of course, the recoveries for fraud have been but $1m. Over seven years, 43 providers have been prosecuted. It would be very easy for any government to slip into a situation of doctor-bashing. I do not believe it is the doctors who are primarily at fault; it is the system that is clearly at fault. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One notable omission from the Auditor-General's report tabled tonight is the question of bulkbilling. When we are talking about such colossal amounts of money it is just amazing that the whole question of bulkbilling has not been raised. As my colleague and friend, Senator Herron, who of course is a notable surgeon, will probably mention later on, the ability for fraud under bulkbilling is just enormous. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key findings of this report are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a lack of prosecutions and disciplinary action . . . The performance of the Commission, with the exception of the last twelve months, shows little improvement over that of the then Department of Health in the early 1980s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commission's legislative powers to combat fraud and excessive servicing are deficient in regard to the investigation and prosecution of unethical medical providers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Medical Services Committees of Inquiry, the main disciplinary bodies, were not operating effectively. . . .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The growth in Pathology Benefits has slowed to the extent that there was a marginal decrease in expenditure in 1991-92 compared to 1990-91. However, Diagnostic Imaging expenditure is still escalating . . .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ability to release information for investigation is important in preventing medifraud and the Commission has been reluctant to fully utilise its powers under the Health Insurance Act because of uncertainty about the effect of privacy legislation. A comprehensive policy is needed.</PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General's report recommends a number of changes, particularly in the legislative areas. Legislative weakness is cited as one of the greatest difficulties in enabling the Health Insurance Commission to pursue medifraud. Of course, there is also a need to have competent investigators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see in the Auditor-General's report, as we saw in the Harvey Bates report&mdash;the private consultant's report undertaken as a precursor to this report&mdash;that the Health Insurance Commission was particularly lax in pursuing and investigating within the guidelines that it had at the time. It was also lax in taking up the recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee of Public Accounts, which in the mid-1980s pursued a number of reports dealing with fraud and overservicing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That Committee's reports reveal a number of factors which affected the Commonwealth health budget at that time. According to the Auditor-General, these factors included:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">legislative weaknesses</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">prosecution difficulties&mdash;e.g. problems associated with collecting admissible evidence</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Medical Benefits Schedule&mdash;e.g. lack of clarity</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">technological advances, especially in regards to pathology</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">oversupply of doctors, and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">entrepreneurial fraud.</PARA>
<PARA>But one of the notable omissions, even from this collection of recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee of Public Accounts back in the 1980s, is the question of bulkbilling&mdash;and that question simply cannot be ignored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a great pity that the Government has continued to try to hide what is going on in respect of medifraud. Recently I persisted and persisted in my efforts to get a copy of the consultant's report. I find it absolutely amazing that the Government is developing in this Parliament the practice of absolutely and utterly ignoring parliamentary requests. That has happened on this occasion just as it happened recently in respect of other documents. This Senate has requested the tabling of certain documents, yet the responsible Minister has said no. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is absolutely no reason why Mr Howe should have said no to the request made a number of weeks ago for the Harvey Bates's report. It was alleged by him that it would teach people how to commit fraud. It certainly did nothing of the sort. What we are seeing today in the Auditor-General's report proves exactly that. If he was trying to conceal parliamentary inactivity by the Government, then that is one thing. If he was trying to conceal the inadequacies of the Health Insurance Commission, that is another thing. But simply to use the excuse of saying that it would teach people how to commit fraud is totally and utterly misleading. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are seeing in this Auditor-General's report is most disturbing, because money is being wasted and fritted away at a time when this country cannot afford it and a million people are unemployed. I certainly hope that we will see the Health Insurance Commission act swiftly on the recommendations in the Auditor-General's report. I also hope that the Commission will look very closely at the comprehensive report put together by the consultant, Mr Harvey Bates. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not reiterate the points that Senator Knowles made in speaking to this report of the Auditor-General. I have seen today one of the most farcical press releases I have ever read since I have been in this place&mdash;a press release put out by Mr Howe who somehow has had some flash of light on the road to Damascus that something is not well with Medicare. Somehow light has dawned on him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the mid-1980s a report highlighted the problems that surrounded the Medicare system. Included in that report was concern about fraud. Also included was concern about lack of legislative powers under the Health Insurance Act to apprehend and deal with people for engaging in fraud and/or overservicing. Nothing was done about this until a year ago. We then began to see something being done. Why? Because the Auditor-General decided that he would do an audit. Suddenly the Health Insurance Commission decided that it would appoint a consultant. Things started to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does Mr Howe say in his press release? The press release states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services, Brian Howe, today signalled the Government would move quickly to draw up legislative proposals designed to enable the Health Insurance Commission to deal more effectively with fraud and overservicing of Medicare and Pharmaceutical Benefits.</PARA>
<PARA>He should have done that seven years ago when he was told that there were problems. But somehow it has taken the Auditor-General to go in there, and then Harvey Bates to be appointed as a consultant, for the Minister to do anything about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How much of the Australian taxpayers' money has been lost? How much money that has been lost because of fraud could have been used to reduce those dreadful hospital waiting lists? Millions and millions of dollars have been wasted in fraud. Hip operations have not been done; cataract operations have not been done; people are living in pain and anguish because this Minister and obviously previous health Ministers have sat on their hands and done nothing about what they knew existed. They had been told. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Howe said&mdash;and this will make Senator Knowles laugh if she has not read it&mdash;that he was going to have wide and open consultations with the medical and pharmacy professions. I am sure that they will find that most entertaining. What are we told over and over again by the health professions? Every time we have the optometrists in, we are told, `We were never consulted. We do not get consulted'. The pathologists come in and say, `We were not consulted'; the pharmacists say, `We were not consulted'; the medicos say, `We were not consulted'; people in disability fields say, `We were not consulted'. Every time under this Minister we hear the words, `We have not been consulted'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think I get the same complaints from peak bodies of constituents in respect of any other Minister that they were never consulted. Mr Howe, on the road to Damascus, has suddenly discovered that the way forward is through open and wide consultations. I could have told Mr Howe before I even came into this place that the way to move forward is to consult, to find out, and to say to people, `We have got a limited amount of money. How are we going to achieve this together?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> That is not what is done. The message comes from on high. We get some bureaucratic idea which is totally incomprehensible, such the idiotic suggestion that was made some years ago of merging all small rural nursing homes that were less than 250 kilometres apart. There is no concern for the humans at the end of the line&mdash;the real people. Notwithstanding that, we are told that there will be open and wide consultations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Howe says that he will get an adviser. He is going to appoint an adviser who will play a key role in consultations and in making sure we get it right. He said that he will be appointing an eminent medical practitioner. I can tell Mr Howe that it is too late. He should have got it right when he first got in and when other Ministers held the health portfolio. He has got it so wrong that he will not have the chance to get it right. It will be the coalition that gets it right, not Mr Howe with his fancy consultant. He should have had someone in there years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fraud has been extensive. We do not know how much it is and Senator Herron will deal with that in more detail. The Government has no idea. Seven per cent? Ten per cent? It is anybody's guess. Mr Howe also says that the Government is going to review diagnostic imaging services. Good for him, but when one sees the figures one will see that they have been going out for a long time too. Something should have been done about that before this. It took the Auditor-General going in for Mr Howe to be shaken and jolted into doing something about our Medicare system which is in disarray and which is not delivering services to people who genuinely need them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said this before and I will say it again: I had a local newsagent ring me up in desperation. He told me that he cannot bear to see an old lady who comes into his newsagency week in and week out, deteriorating because she has waited two years or 14 months&mdash;I cannot remember what it is; it most probably seems like 10 years to her&mdash;to get a hip replacement. He has nothing to do with this lady; she is a customer of his. There are women and men like that throughout Australia. They have been waiting while the Minister sat on his hands while the fraud has gone on. He knew in the early 1980s that we needed legislative changes, that there were difficulties in having prosecutions, that there were problems with the medical benefits schedule, that there were technological advances in medicine that needed to be addressed and that there was fraud. All of those things he knew. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General has not told us anything much new. There are a few extra things about the oversupply of doctors, because that has changed maybe in the last six or seven years, but everything else was in that earlier report in some form or other. Nothing has been done by this Government. The Government will stand condemned because, for the public, health is one of the major issues, next to unemployment, which are so drastic in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the worst recession in 60 years and now we have a health system in total disarray. We have the Minister distributing in the press gallery an absolutely farcical story about how he has now seen the light and he is going to do something about it. Let me tell Mr Howe that it is too late. He will not have the chance because it will be Bob Woods the Minister for health who will address the problems and make sure that the health dollar is delivered in the right place to those people in need. We will reduce those hospital waiting lists, we will get a proper balance between private and public health and we will restore the best health system in the world. We had that and we will restore that. Mr Howe is so late that it does not matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Auditor-General's report on medifraud and excessive servicing is an absolute indictment of the Health Insurance Commission and of Medicare itself. I particularly wish to draw the Senate's attention to the overview on the first page. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At that time, the extent of fraud and overservicing was estimated by the then Department of Health to be `. . . at least 7% of the total medical benefits expenditure by the Commonwealth and health funds'. This 7% represented $100m in the 1981/82 financial year when Commonwealth medical benefits expenditure `. . . amounted to $1497m'. The Australian Medical Association agreed with this figure.</PARA>
<PARA>In 1982, the Australian Medical Association cooperated with the then Minister for Health, Dr Blewett. When Dr Blewett came out with an announcement that Medicare fraud amounted to 7 per cent of the total medical benefits the AMA agreed with him and said that they should cooperate in doing something about this. When those figures were analysed, eventually Dr Blewett had to concede that there was no veracity at all in that statement. The President of the Australian Medical Association apologised to his members and was not re-elected on the next occasion. In fact, he stood down because he had misled both his membership and the Australian public. Yet this document, based on that figure, says that the base line is 7 per cent and it has been extrapolated from that that it must be more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the figures in the report. In seven years the recoveries from excess servicing was $ 1/2m. It is estimated that Medicare expenditure over that period of time would be in the vicinity of seven times $3,000m to $4,000m, and out of that it got back $500,000&mdash;an average of $71,420 a year. I did a quick calculation on my calculator and that is 0.0000155 per cent. It is an infinitesimal amount, and 51 medical practitioners were disciplined in the recovery of that amount of money. In 1991-92 $55,000 was recovered from four providers. Senator McKiernan should note that of the 36,000 doctors in Australia, four were prosecuted and $55,000 was recovered. It is absolutely unbelievable on two counts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unbelievable that the current mechanisms&mdash;I support the report in that regard&mdash;are such that with that enormous expenditure of money, $4,600m, we were able to recover $55,000. It is absurd. That was on what is called excessive servicing but let us look at fraud, deliberate attempts to steal. In seven years I estimate that about $28,000m was paid out by Medicare and $5.6m was recovered. If one goes to one's calculator and calculates $5.6m as a percentage of $28,000m, one again gets a figure of 0.000-something per cent&mdash;an infinitesimal amount of money. In that period of time, 12,000 investigations occurred and 43 of the 36,000 medical practitioners in Australia were prosecuted. It is absolutely absurd. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not saying that people are not committing fraud or overservicing, but that excessive servicing can be explained in some cases. A simple example is a friend of mine, an anaesthetist, who was investigated by a medical services committee of inquiry because he was putting three times the average number of intravenous drips into patients. He was investigated. The committee discovered that he was the chief anaesthetist at the Prince Charles cardiac hospital in Brisbane which required at least four drips to be put into any one patient having either a coronary bypass operation or a heart transplant. That example explains why some of those 12,000 investigations did not proceed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mind boggles at how much money may have been spent&mdash;this report does not allude to it&mdash;on investigating those 43 doctors over seven years who committed medifraud. In 1991-92, as I mentioned, $4,600m was paid out in Medicare and the recovery was $1m. That is 0.00002 per cent of the total expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Four providers out of the 36,000 doctors in Australia were actually prosecuted. It is not mentioned in the report that at least one of the four, a pathologist, for a significant sum of money, appealed to the High Court and had the judgment overturned. He was paid out over $1m. I bring these figures to the Senate's attention because they obviously  demonstrate&mdash;and I support the Audit Office to this degree&mdash;that there is very little in the way of legislation or resources to deal with this problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the basic problem? How can this occur? Both Senator Knowles and Senator Patterson referred to it. The basis of it is that, under Medicare, there is a blank cheque. People are given a card, they can go to any doctor, the card is zipped through a machine and they sign it. There is no check on it, and no co-payment by the doctor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Robert Ray had to put his hand in his pocket and pay out some money for a service, he would say, `What am I getting for this service? Why am I spending this money?'. He would then say, `I want to get my money's worth out of this'. But under Medicare he can sign a blank cheque&mdash;he need not even know what is put on the blank cheque&mdash;and it costs him nothing. So Senator Ray says to himself, `This is magic. It's costing me zilch. I have got the service, I have had the pathology test done&mdash;isn't that great', not appreciating that the taxpayer is picking up the cost at the other end and that it has the potential for fraud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are four case studies in this report, one of which involves tattoo removal by laser. The doctor involved advertised the removal of tattoos at no cost to the patient through direct billing to Medicare. He did multiple removals over a long period of time, bulk-billed Medicare and made a fortune out of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second case study involves a public health CT scan. I will not bore people with the details because they are in the report. In this case a man decided to make money by having CT scans. He went to different doctors and gave false names and complaints because he thought that this was an absolute bonanza. He got $284 every time he had a CT scan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third case study involved double dipping. In Adelaide the Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science, a State operated pathology laboratory, provides pathology to doctors and providers. The Commonwealth assists with the funding of the institute. For the unethical pathologist, it is possible to have work undertaken by the Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science and then bill the patient under Medicare. That is what happened in the third case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth case involved a grandmother nicknamed `Granny Robin', who recently obtained nine Medicare cards. She went around making claims with the aid of dead women's birth certificates. Certainly bulkbilling is capable of exploitation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The four examples in the report are an indictment of the Medicare system. The Department recognised that last year and wanted to bring in co-payment so that patients would be the ones who would put a brake on the possibility of fraud. All the organised medical profession wants to prevent the very thing that is referred to in the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like Senator Patterson, I almost laughed when I saw in a press release that the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) is to appoint an eminent medical person to advise him. When the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs investigated radiology, the Minister sent his adviser in this area to brief us on our report, which we believe was also an indictment on the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services. The adviser did not have any idea about radiology, he was unable to tell us anything, and the Minister was not prepared to come along and brief us. So if his press report is any indication of the position, I wish him well because he has never done that before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister should involve the organised professions in advising him, because I am sure they will. All of us on both sides of the Parliament want to stamp out fraud. It has to be done. The mechanisms have to be given to the Health Insurance Commission, and particularly the neural networking system of computerisation. It applied for funding of $500,000 but was granted $237,000 out of a budget of $4,600m. The profession must be given the resources to stamp out fraud. The basic cause of it is bulkbilling. Until bulkbilling is removed, there will be medifraud and overservicing. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>I am sure honourable senators will recall that the provision of special benefits under the Social Security Act is intended to provide adequate income for people in hardship who, although unable to support themselves or their independents, are not otherwise entitled to a pension or allowance. A basic condition of the payment is that the claimant is in severe financial hardship. Consideration is given to both the long term and short term needs of the applicant when he or she applies for the benefit. The rate of special benefit payable is discretionary, although it cannot exceed the rate of the Jobsearch allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In short, special benefits are intended as payments of last resort to those in dire financial circumstances. During the financial year 1991-92, special beneficiary numbers increased from 29,800 to 34,800, or by 17 per cent. Payment outlays rose from $261.7m in 1990-91 to $304.1m in 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The release of the Auditor-General's report today by the Australian National Audit Office confirms that tighter administration of special benefit by the Department of Social Security and a more rigorous application of DSS guidelines could save up to $7m in annual benefit payments. When he was Minister for Social Security, Senator Richardson said in this chamber over and over again, especially when Fightback first came out, that no more savings could be made in social security and that everything was as tight as possible. We used the term `taut and terrific' because we were told that nothing could be done in social security to make savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have in one small program an estimated saving by the Auditor-General of $7m. The ANAO estimates that further savings may be achieved by revising DSS guidelines to make them more consistent with the underlying purposes of special benefits&mdash;namely, to support only those individuals who are in immediate hardship and without any other available means of support for reasons beyond their control. The report also outlines that there were some inconsistencies in the internal guidelines for this program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are all aware of the parlous state of the economy, the record 11.4 per cent unemployment and the hardship that many in our community are suffering. It is absolutely essential that the financial relief the Government provides is well targeted and reaches those most in need. It is very much like the last report we debated dealing with the Health Insurance Commission. The money is limited and ought to be targeted. We ought to ensure that the money reaches the right people rather than its being lost to fraud, or in this case lost because the program has not really been directed at those to whom it is targeted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is apparent from today's report that the targeting has not been achieved. I refer particularly to the fact that it is found that special benefit has been used to accommodate difficult or sensitive cases from mainstream social security programs. Some would be assisted more appropriately under such programs as the Jobsearch allowance and disability support. The Auditor-General has said that there are people who would fit much better into those programs. Perhaps they have been slotted into that category because it is too hard or it is easier to put them under special benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the key ANAO recommendations is that the Social Security Act and supporting guidelines be reviewed and strengthened to make them more consistent with the underlying purposes of the special benefit, but not to disadvantage the truly needy. Another recommendation is that more guidelines and support should be given to regional office staff in the exercise of their discretionary powers under this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the DSS has recognised problems in the administration of the special benefit for some time and has in the 1992-93 Budget introduced measures that are expected to tighten the administration of the special benefit, which is expected to save $3.7m in a full year, I am disappointed in its response to this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department has only agreed to or partly agreed with 12 of the 22 ANAO recommendations. In addition, the DSS has not agreed with the ANAO's savings estimate and has further indicated that it believes that the guidelines are matters for government consideration only. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this is a shallow response and I put on the record my extreme disappointment at the blinkered view of the Department in refusing to take on board many of the recommendations made by the Australian National Audit Office. </PARA>

<PARA>This report by the Auditor-General on the Department of Defence new submarine project concerns the project to build new Collins class submarines in Australia. This is of significance to the defence of Australia, according to the Auditor-General, because it represents an important commitment of expenditure of $5 billion in April 1992 prices. The Auditor-General states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The contract for the submarines includes necessary performance standards and the Project Office is in the process of ensuring proper testing against these standards. The Project Office is also taking reasonable steps to ensure that the submarines will meet quality requirements. The ANAO is concerned, however, about the financial management of the project and the achievement of the contracted delivery schedule.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Senate will be aware, senators from New South Wales have expressed concern initially about the failure of appropriate volumes of this contract coming to New South Wales. Therefore, it is quite disappointing to find that the main findings of this audit are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the contract does not adequately protect the Commonwealth against loss</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the Commonwealth has advanced funds (initially $120m) to the Contractor without adequate information about the need for those funds</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.in its dealings with the Contractor, the Project Office has frequently taken a position which would be more appropriate if it were dealing with a fellow Government entity rather than a commercial organisation with a primary responsibility to its shareholders</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the Project Office has not given sufficient weight to the importance of the timing of the payments</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the Project Office's assertion that the project is on schedule is not supported by the data that can be obtained from the Contract Monitoring and Control System and the ANAO believes the slippage which is evident within the schedule will be difficult to recover prior to the launch and commissioning dates for the first submarine</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.contract amendment procedures may have resulted in excessive prices being charged by the Contractor.</PARA>
<PARA>The report indicates:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANAO makes a number of recommendations primarily intended to ensure that future contracts overcome the problems identified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Defence contests a number of the ANAO findings but agrees or agrees in principle with 15 of the 30 recommendations in the report.</PARA>
<PARA>I would briefly like to mention a couple of other points made by the Auditor-General. The report contains one particular conclusion about the risk of loss of funds and states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The protection provided by the Contract is insufficient relative to the losses that may be sustained by the Commonwealth in the event of failure or default by the Contractor.</PARA>
<PARA>The report makes the point that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Contract does not prevent the repatriation of dividends to shareholders prior to the major risks of the Contract being overcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Significant dividends and management salaries paid since the commencement of the Contract mean that in the event of Contractor default the total value of assets that can be obtained from the Contractor are less than the value paid by the Commonwealth to that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Contract specifically prevents recourse by the Commonwealth to the Contractor's shareholders in relation to any deficit.</PARA>
<PARA>The report also makes the point about financial risk without an appropriate return. The Auditor-General says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Substantial funds have been advanced to the Contractor without sufficient certainty that this action is in the Commonwealth's interest.</PARA>
<PARA>I will not read too much more of the report because no doubt the Minister will want to respond. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case the advance of funds was based only on what the Auditor-General describes as `belief'. The Auditor-General goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Contractor did not provide budgeted cash flow statements or profit and loss statements to allow the Commonwealth or its consultants to verify the amount required.</PARA>
<PARA>This relates to considerable amounts of money, because the contract provides for the Commonwealth to pay ASC claims on a 30-day basis related to actual progress. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The average monthly claim made by ASC to 30 June 1991 was $37 million. The ASC earned $9m in interest in 1987/88 which would indicate an average investment of around $80m.</PARA>
<PARA>Providing up-front funding which was obviously not needed by ASC because it was put in the bank to earn interest, irrespective of the reasons for such funding, has provided the company with a means of making significant returns to shareholders before any major risk area has been overcome. The Auditor-General concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Contractor earned $9m in interest in its first year of operation and $77m in interest in its first four years of operation. This is not indicative of a `slightly positive' cash flow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the Auditor-General's report. I have not dealt with it at great length because we have pressures of legislation, but I ask that the Department of Defence may consider that more than just 15 of the 30 recommendations merit serious attention. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to speak on the Auditor-General's report&mdash;an efficiency audit into the Department of Defence's new submarine project. It is terribly important for public life in Australia that there is an independent auditor. The Parliament raises taxes, which is never a pleasant obligation on the members of this Parliament. The payment of taxes, despite the legislative backing for it, is largely voluntary. It depends on the goodwill of the community to pay them. There is a contrary side to that. It puts an obligation on the Parliament to account very clearly for the way it spends that money. One of the ways of reassuring the public that the money has been spent properly and honestly is by having an independent auditor.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a very good point. I am glad Senator Schacht raised that because, instead of messing around with this sort of nonsensical efficiency audit, if the Auditor-General had inquired into the expenditure of the Civil Aviation Authority and the loss of several hundreds of millions of dollars through maladministration cumulatively over the years, we would all be better off.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that we have an independent auditor and it is important that that auditor is not an instrument of the Executive Government; it is important that the auditor is answerable to the Parliament. His purpose ought to be to prevent fraud, theft and other malpractices in a financial arena in relation to the expenditure of public funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent times the Auditor-General, for reasons that I do not follow, has gone into this concept of efficiency audits. It may well be possible to run an efficiency audit if one has a chain of fish shops, hardware stores or something like that where there are volume sales and some pattern by which one can assess efficiency. But when it is applied to the Department of Defence&mdash;which by any standards is a notoriously uncommercial body where we have to have reserve capacity, where we have to provide for unforeseen contingencies and where it becomes increasingly difficult to buy missiles and equipment other than being part of a block purchase that we hold for years&mdash;the efficiency audit is really quite nonsensical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said on many occasions when these efficiency audits have come up that the Auditor-General ought to back off from the efficiency audit. By all means, he should go into Defence and assure everyone that the money has been properly spent. But let us keep away from the efficiency side of it where the Auditor-General simply has no methodology that is competent to assess the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent years we have seen glaring examples of the inadequacy of an efficiency audit. We had the recent audit on training areas. The Department of Defence, 10 or 12 years ago, bought a very large area of land for a very low price at Yampi Sound as a training area. That was bought for the next 100 years. The Auditor-General got very indignant about the fact that the land, for which $600,000 or $1.2m million was spent&mdash;I forget the figure, it is irrelevant, but it was a relatively low sum&mdash;has never been used. No-one has ever been on the land. The Auditor-General is totally incapable of understanding that it is for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General's report on the ADF reserves was absolutely legendary for its misdirection and the false conclusions that resulted. I come back to the important point: that the Auditor has to be seen to be independent and objective. My great fear is that the Auditor is debasing his reputation by getting into nonsensical areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the report that is before us deals with the contract that was set up between the Government and the Australian Submarine Corporation. I have very great difficulty in agreeing with anything the Auditor says about that. It is a matter of public record that the Australian Submarine Corporation, based in Adelaide, was set up as a pork-barrelling political exercise by Mr Beazley&mdash;not Senator Ray. I will put that to one side because I do not wish to embarrass Senator Schacht. The fact remains that a legally binding contract was drawn up between the Commonwealth and the Australian Submarine Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it might be of interest for the Auditor-General or any other element of the Department of Finance to look at the terms of the contract with the benefit of hindsight and see how it could be improved in the future, the fact is that it was a contract that was freely entered into between the ASC and the Commonwealth. If the Commonwealth is now being taken down in the eyes of the Auditor-General because he thinks the payments are extravagant, I am afraid that is just too bad. Let the Commonwealth Government, the present government in power, wear the blame for writing an ill-advised contract. It is not fair, as the Auditor-General has tried to do, to hang the blame for the contract on the Australian Submarine Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I come back to the point that I started on. The Auditor-General ought to back off from efficiency audits. If he persists with this path, he will debase the high prestige that his organisation has because he is applying methodology which is totally inappropriate to a department such as the Department of Defence and its contractors. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the first time I have ever bothered to come into the chamber to discuss an Auditor-General's report. I normally follow due process and draw up a response, as I must, send it to the Minister for Finance and implement the necessary adjustments recommended by the Auditor. I was somewhat disappointed to know that this report had been leaked to at least one member of the Opposition some weeks ago. That is disappointing from my point of view because it leaves me in a poor position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators can imagine how much more seriously I viewed the fact that the Auditor-General's press release on this matter was issued yesterday before it was tabled in this chamber or in the other chamber. Inquiries were then instituted as to why this occurred and the claim was made that, unfortunately, the press release was accidentally issued. This is a sign to me that the Auditor-General either does not respect his responsibility to report to this Parliament before he reports to the press or that we have a fairly unprofessional organisation in some aspects. Either way, I think it raises serious questions about the management of the Australian National Audit Office. I was contacted today to be told that the Auditor-General plans to have a background briefing on this report for the press tomorrow. I do not know the ethics of that, but I do know that I do not like public servants having background briefings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also had some doubts when the Department was contacted for an efficiency audit on the purchase of the additional&mdash;up to 18&mdash;F111s before it even sent the negotiating team to Washington. Tonight I wish to acknowledge some of the criticisms of the Auditor-General but also contest some of these claims to give the Senate a more balanced view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to look at the audit methodology. In looking at the report, I appreciate the difficulties that the Audit Office has in conducting a review of such a very large and complex project. The Audit Office's timetable in issuing this report today was self-imposed. My Department has strongly advised the Audit Office that more time should be given to discuss all the issues involved in this report. Brief discussion in recent weeks has led to a substantial modification of the Auditor's original stance. No doubt, further careful examination would lead to a significant shift in his position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to give one indication of that. Honourable senators will notice that in a range of issues&mdash;I think Senator Baume touched on it&mdash;mention was made that there was a $5 billion contract, with $10m private investment, and that this particular matter was serious. In discussions with my Department, it was agreed to take that matter out of the executive summary because it was uncertain and simply leave it in the body of the report. That was agreed; that is the way it is in the report. What is the first major issue in the Auditor-General's press release? It touches on that very point to be highlighted. The matter agreed between my Department and the Auditor-General as uncertain was taken out of the executive summary but put up-front in that press release that was issued yesterday. I am most unhappy about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frankly, the Audit Office lacks the technical expertise to address the biggest risks in this project&mdash;that is, the engineering and software aspects. It lacks the commercial experience to fully appreciate the practical realities of a fixed price contract won under fierce competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the rush to get this report tabled, the Audit Office did not accept my Department's request for its response to be fully self-contained. In other words, there are the Auditor's views, and we put our views and what happens? Our views are not put up front, back or anywhere. They are cut and pasted and distributed, with full editorial rights, to the Auditor-General. Tonight I will table the response of the Defence Department in its comprehensive completeness so at least senators can read it and see what our overall response is, argued in a logical way, rather than cut and paste through the report. I table that. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The document read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">RESPONSE BY DEPARTMENT OF DEFENCE</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANAO Report is critical of aspects of the financial arrangements entered into by the Commonwealth with the Australian Submarine Corporation (ASC), and of aspects of the way the Contract with ASC has been managed particularly in respect of changes subsequently embodied into the Contract.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Defence notes that the original decisions taken by Cabinet were based on long&mdash;term strategies for the national interest. The Project was seen as an opportunity to enhance Australian industry capability and competitiveness, as well as to ensure indigenous support for the submarines throughout their operational lives of about 30 years. The greater part of the investment was to benefit Australia, not only through job creation but also through technology transfer, creation of new skills, improved quality practices, development of modern management techniques and the introduction of new and more progressive industrial relations practices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The processes and procedures that led to the selection of ASC to construct in Australia six new submarines for the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) were thorough and exhaustive. The risks involved were substantial.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The determinants of risk were the unique platform and combat system (both of a new design), Australia's lack of previous experience, new consortium (ASC), separation of design centres from production centres, fast track design and production, the long construction phase (about 12 years), innovation (steel, ship control system, towed array, ADA software, anechoics, ILS elements, etc) and the Australian industrial environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The key judgment was where to share this risk with an Australian company which had no previous experience. In the view of the Government the majority of the risk should lie with ASC though it was inevitable that the Commonwealth would effectively provide much of the capital involved, and would share some of the risk. ASC's risk was in turn shared by its major subcontractors through the performance guarantee requirements of the Contract.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before responding to ANAO criticisms, the Department would draw attention to the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a.the current status of the project which is on schedule, within budget and ahead on performance, a considerable achievement for a $5 billion project five years on;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">b.the dominance in the original and current risk assessment of technical and performance risks (which are also the major source of cost and schedule risks), neither of which is raised as a matter of concern by ANAO;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">c.the competitive circumstances surrounding the contract, which maximises value for money but simultaneously limits the Commonwealth's leverage to extract additional concessions from a winning tenderer without offering commensurate additional payments or other offsetting conditions;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">d.the considerable advance made by Defence, and the Commonwealth as a whole, in its contractual practices with the Submarine Project, which have been further refined in subsequent projects (including in areas mentioned by ANAO);</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">e.the importance in such a large, long-term, high risk contract of close cooperation between the Department and its contractors including acceptance of their need to make a reasonable profit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Generally, the ANAO findings reflect little appreciation either of these broader Government considerations or of the technical aspects of "development risk". Naval shipbuilding, including the relatively short history of submarine construction, has many examples where countries embarked in embryonic design/construction programs and suffered initial, disastrous losses. The Australian Government recognised these risks and took them into account.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Current Status</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After more than five years since contract award, the project is on time, within budget and the predicted performance of the new submarines (the Collins Class) generally exceeds the contract performance specification requirements. Importantly, through careful management by all parties involved in the project, the remaining risk is significantly less in many areas than perceived at the time of contract award. Nonetheless, some areas of technical (and hence schedule) risk remain substantial. It would be inappropriate to downgrade these risks until nearer to delivery of Submarine 01.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Progress to date includes:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the continuing successful implementation of the Government's defence self reliance policy, particularly the capacity to support, maintain and adapt the new submarines and their various systems throughout their operational lives;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the successful implementation of a number of major initiatives associated with the Australian Industry Involvement program:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">-expenditure in Australia of 70 cents in the dollar of total project funds has been a major contribution to the overall increase in Defence major equipment spending in Australia from 30% to 65% over the last decade;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The contribution of the Project towards greater international recognition of Australian Defence Force and industry capabilities, and towards increased credibility and standing of Australia in the SE Asia and SW Pacific regions, should also not be ignored.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Management Focus</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Defence appreciates the difficulties ANAO had in conducting a review of such a large and complex project, but questions the technical experience and understanding of the audit team to make the overall judgements implied in the report. It is also unfortunate that more time was not given to consultation with higher executives in the Project Office and the Department, and with related agencies such as the Attorney-General's Department.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Project Office management focus has at all times been directed to ensuring that the six submarines would meet the required performance and be `fit for purpose'. Dominant project activities centred on engineering, safety and risk management.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With design and production centres spread across ten countries (Europe, North America and Australia), engineering management has been a formidable challenge. This would have been a difficult task in a mature industry environment. The Project Office had therefore the additional task of nurturing the creation of a new industry including the development of ASC. Difficulties with ASC were certainly encountered in the initial years of the contract. This was due to the consortium arrangements at that time, a situation which was subsequently rectified to the benefit of all parties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Contract Amendments</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To support its findings and conclusions, the ANAO cites, by way of examples, a number of Contract Amendments (CAPs). The factors involved in each of the Contract Amendments were more extensive than described by ANAO.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the case of Electric Cables (CAP No. 321) for example, the negotiations also embraced the redesign, production and installation of a single bilge pump to replace the two units operating in series as designed by Kockums. While that design met the RAN performance requirements, it imposed operating procedures unsuited to the deep diving depth capability of the submarines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While ANAO asserts that "ASC had planned on using cables which did not meet the contractual standard" the actual position was far more complex and was certainly not clear cut even taking into account advice from the Australian Government Solicitor. Kockums offered in good faith a cable to a Swedish specification during the Project Definition Study in the belief that it satisfied the RAN specification requirement based on UK standards (NES 518 and NES 525). The comparison of specifications and standards of one country with those of another is a difficult and sometimes impossible task because of the different philosophies and tests involved. In addition, standards (including those of the UK) are reissued from time to time to incorporate improvements based on experience (eg Falkland's war).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The RAN accepted the Swedish cable specification offered by Kockums because it was current, it met the requirements of the Royal Swedish Navy and it appeared to conform generally with NES 518 and NES 525. Some year or so after Contract award, however, Kockums advised that under certain laboratory tests, the Swedish electric cable discharged toxic gases with levels in excess of NES 518 criteria relating to sheathing materials.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While there were clear benefits in acquiring new electric cables manufactured to the latest UK standards, there were also a number of major difficulties. These included increased cost, a long manufacturing lead time, redesign by Kockums and other ASC subcontractors of electric cabling and, finally but not least, installation and handling (ie increased production costs by ASC). A major difficulty involved in the Electric Cable negotiations related to schedule. ASC initially advised that the changes in cable could involve a 14 month slippage to the program. Under the contract terms and conditions, the cost associated with such a delay could have been borne by the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Resolution of the electric cable and bilge pump problems with their attendant cost, schedule, safety and performance implications was a major challenge that called for understanding and compromise on the part of all parties involved. The outcome, negotiated and agreed over many months, was fair and reasonable. ASC agreed to accept responsibility for the design and procurement of a new bilge pump, the Commonwealth agreed to fund the cost of the new cables including small premiums for a shortened manufacturing lead time and their installation. ASC agreed to fund the redesign work required by Kockums and other subcontractors and to maintain the original delivery schedule as contracted, and the Commonwealth agreed to waive Liquidated Damages only for late delivery of the first submarine for up to three months.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The circumstances and factors relating to each of the other examples of Contract Amendments cited by ANAO also need to be fully understood in order to gain an appreciation of the circumstances affecting the negotiations with ASC and the subsequent decision to accept each of the changes in their final form. The following synopsis of the more significant examples of Contract Amendments is relevant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ILS Documentation Building CAP 149.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ANAO compared the cost of a purpose designed facility with that of a general purpose accommodation building. ANAO also relied on preliminary data relating to the timing of payments. The price of the ILS Documentation Building included elements for security, siteworks, external services, office fitout and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">furniture, and construction management. When comparing the price of this building with the RAN Accommodation Building (part of the ACF), ANAO failed to recognise that these elements were priced in separate packages for the ACF. On a comparative basis, the price of the ILS Documentation Building was about $1 350/m(2).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Electric Control Room and Control Room/Lower Accommodation Platforms Fabrication and Outfitting CAP Nos. 1538/1874.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The CAPs were priced on the basis of competitive quotations obtained by ASC for the fabrication work. The outfitting work was estimated by ASC based on Kockums limited progress of outfitting, setting to work and testing of the platforms for submarine 01. The final prices for platforms for submarines 02-06 were substantially less than the Project Office's own estimates derived from Kockums fixed prices for the platforms for submarine 01, the learning curves both in Sweden and Australia, and knowledge that ASC itself was not entitled to a profit margin for this particular work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Combat System Support and Test Equipment (CSSTE) CAP No.1418. This complex CAP brought together all the remaining ILS work for the Combat System including documentation, training, training equipment, etc. The CAP was fully investigated by the Financial Cost Investigation Group in NSW. The total price of the ILS CAPs (including those for the platform) was some $90m less than the initial Contract indicative price for the same scope of work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">System Test and Software Support Facility (STSSF) CAP No.1327. The Contract was based on the premise that ASC would set to work the Integrated Ship Control Management and Monitoring System (ISCMMS) in the submarines. This activity included software integration and test. More than two years after Contract award it became clear to the Project Office that ASC's intent was a risky approach and that also a dedicated Land Based Test Site or STSSF would be required to support ISCMMS in service. Such a facility was not foreshadowed in the Contract. The negotiations with ASC were extended in order to have the company contribute to the cost of the facility on the basis that it would reduce its risk of delay in setting to work submarine 01. The 75/25 cost split was finally agreed on the basis that the Commonwealth will own the facility and it will be delivered in the late 1990s to HMAS STIRLING in WA on completion of delivery of submarine 06. The new approach also greatly enhanced safety.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Logistic Management Data System (LMDS) Cap No. 360.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The issue was not so much one of price and visibility but rather the relationship of LMDS to the Ships Information Management System and Ships Information System (SIMS/SIS). The negotiations, which continued over more than one year, were difficult because the RAN had not finalised its requirements for SIMS/SIS. LMDS was not a deliverable to the RAN and was in effect a proprietary item. A `cost reimbursement' approach would not have resolved this difficulty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Overall Cost Control</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANAO findings convey the view that ASC benefited financially to a disproportionate extent through some Contract Amendments incorporated into the Contract. Given the complexities involved in each case, and the protracted negotiations, undoubtedly there is room for different judgements of what an appropriate outcome should have been. Consistent with sensible risk management, the Project Office also exercised a degree of `give and take' in its negotiations concentrating its efforts on key matters. Defence is satisfied that overall the Commonwealth position has been well protected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The contract comprised fixed price elements of work (95% of the contract price), provisionally priced elements (5% of the contract price) and indicative priced elements for ILS and other work to be included into the contract at a later time. Most of these elements have now been incorporated into the contract at fixed prices. The provisionally priced elements increased in price by about $70m. The indicative priced elements (largely ILS) decreased by about $90m against the initial budget of about $530m. In addition, the total cost to date of engineering changes for all six submarines has been about $80m. The number and value of engineering change proposals has been extremely low by comparison with overseas shipbuilding programs of similar size and complexity. The net increase in the value of the contract price as initially identified has therefore been minor.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not for the Department to defend ASC, but Defence does question the ANAO view that ASC has intentionally exploited the Commonwealth for short term gain. Defence notes ASC's longer term commercial interest in quality, the development of its national and international reputation, and its long term corporate aspirations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Review of audit findings</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Risk of inadequate performance</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department is confident that the performance of the new submarines will meet, and in some cases exceed, the specified requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Risk of inadequate construction quality</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response to recommendation</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The number of Australian companies with accredited quality management systems to an international standard has increased significantly since the mid-1980s. In future contracts, where companies do not possess accreditation, the Department will include some motivational measures to ensure the accreditation is given a high priority by the Contractor.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Financial risk&mdash;Loss of funds</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response to findings</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department and Cabinet were fully informed of the risk position and the measures taken to minimise the risk to the Commonwealth. These measures included: financial guarantees initially worth $177m; mortgages over the assets of ASC; progressive vesting of title in the supplies; and, performance guarantees from the parents of the companies undertaking the major part of the work as subcontractors to ASC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The $200m in ASC's annual accounts referred to by ANAO as advance payments by the Commonwealth, comprise that part of the contract price for materials and equipments which represents ASC's general contingency for future risks. This liability is not a measure of payment for materials and equipments which have not been vested by the Commonwealth, as ANAO implies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department's assessment is that the financial risks to the Commonwealth today is low, given achievements to date, ASC's own risk studies, and remaining financial guarantees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department is satisfied that under the most unlikely and extreme situation of default by ASC, sufficient assets will exist to enable the Commonwealth to arrange for completion of work. Under the contract the Commonwealth is entitled to recovery of guarantees, possession of the construction facility, control of all work in progress, completed design and due performance of subcontractors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department is of the view that for a very long term contract it is unreasonable to expect major companies involved to delay repatriation of dividends to shareholders prior to the major risks of the Contract being overcome. Dividends should be assessed against reserves, contingency and residual risk, and the Department understands that ASC considers it has adequate reserves and contingency to meet its future commitments even under the `worst case' risk scenarios. ASC's dividends to date equate to about 2.5% of the Contract price.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While a case may be made to allow the Commonwealth recourse to a contractor's shareholders, such a contractual provision would almost certainly involve some cost premium. The need for such a provision also depends on the adequacy of other financial guarantees. The Department considers those other measures to be sufficient.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response to recommendations</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A formal mechanism for collating and reviewing all comments made in the tender evaluation process is already in place for major Defence projects. Contract signature does not occur until due Government processes, particularly consideration by the Attorney-General's Department, are complete.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Repatriation of dividends will be identified as a specific topic for negotiation in future major projects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Financial risk&mdash;Risk without appropriate return</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response to findings</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The advance of funds to ASC was determined in a fully competitive environment during the parallel negotiations with ASC and AMS. The start up costs and payment profiles were broadly similar for both contenders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is normal practice for companies to carefully calculate cash flow requirements and projections. The cash flow projections for ASC and AMS were similar across the life of the contract. A comprehensive analysis of the benefits and risks associated with the payment of Commonwealth monies to ASC was carried out as far as it was practicable to do so given the large level of risk inherent in the project. In any long term fixed price contract, there are inevitably swings and balances. The long term financial viability of ASC is paramount for project success.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response to recommendations</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For future contracts the Department will review its requirements for information governing payments to contractors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fixed price contracts have inherent benefits. They are fair to both parties and are relatively easy to administer. The Department does not intend to undermine their viability by including terms and conditions that apply to `cost reimbursement' contracts because of their potential to transfer risk back to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Defence will explore the position to provide up-front funding on a trust basis but up-front funding should be assessed against overall risk and the period of the contract. Benefits to the Commonwealth must be balanced by benefits to the contractor.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Risk of paying more than necessary</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response to findings</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Contract amendments increase the scope of the contract. ASC is entitled to profit on additional work commensurate with the risks involved, which are more than just the shareholders' equity in ASC. It is quite unrealistic&mdash;and unreasonable&mdash;to expect the Commonwealth to negotiate Contract Amendments providing virtually no profit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The assertion that there are examples of significant under-pricing errors by the ASC being corrected through the use of Contract Amendments to increase the amount it is paid is disputed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similarly, Defence does not accept ANAO's assertion that the Project Office has paid twice for the same work. ANAO failed to consider engineering and other factors involved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response to recommendations</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Defence will continue to ensure that Contract Amendments provide due benefit proportional to cost.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Current departmental and government processes underlying management of the project require the project director to gain independent advice on significant contract amendments. The Department will consider further the financial delegations, but notes the considerable benefits of ensuring that the project director has direct control and responsibility for a project.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The terms and conditions of the contract, including the product specification, determine the Commonwealth's position in relation to any dispute. In the case of the Project, the terms and conditions are complex and often interdependent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Risk of failure to minimise opportunity cost</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response to findings</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Project Office has always been satisfied that claimed progress was achieved prior to payment. This is the basis of CMACS and the accompanying verification procedures. For example, during the past 12 months, the Project Office verified 2342 activities out of a total of 13762 resulting in 63 minor discrepancies which were corrected. For the balance of activities, the Project Office relied on ASC's certification procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The contract with ASC is a lump sum for all six submarines delivered at about yearly intervals. It is based on ASC and its subcontractors progressing work and ordering quantities by the most economic means. This promotes efficiencies in production.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Payments are made to ASC on the basis of certified physical progress. Physical progress, and payments to date, match the overall schedule and payment profile established at the time of contract award.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Analysis shows that, as a result of re-scheduling of packages, 498 were started later than the initial schedule baseline incorporated into the Contract, 294 were advanced. In addition, the first progress claim against the majority of packages (70 percent) has been made two months or more after the package start date. The analysis shows that the Contractor has successfully introduced workarounds to offset delays and maintain the overall schedule. The weight of delays to packages in opportunity cost terms exceeds that which applies to those packages advanced by ASC for risk mitigation. The Department therefore questions the ANAO's conclusion that the opportunity cost of funds provided to the Project is significantly higher than it needed to have been.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response to recommendations</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Project Office will continue to place emphasis on risk management and mitigation, product quality, schedule and cost. Consideration of opportunity cost, while often important at the development stage of a project, generally has less relevance in relation to these other factors during project implementation. Nonetheless the Department will look more closely in future at its processes for considering opportunity costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Project Office will continue to provide flexibility to ASC to vary the schedule of individual packages in order that the primary risk remains with the Contractor.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Risk of slippage in the delivery schedule</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response to findings</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The primary purpose of CMACS is to measure progress. CMACS and ASC's Cost Schedule Control System (CSCS) are not the primary tools for schedule control.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Liquidated Damages are not the principal drivers to encourage ASC to perform to schedule and achieve the delivery of the submarines on time. Liquidated Damages are a means of offsetting costs incurred by the Commonwealth as a result of shortfalls in performance or delays. They do not offset or replace other terms and conditions in the contract which require ASC to deliver the submarines to quality, cost and schedule, the risk for which lies substantially with ASC. It is clearly in ASC's interest to achieve success.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response to recommendations</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of Liquidated Damages should remain extant and separate from other more significant terms and conditions. The Department agrees nonetheless that it is desirable for damages to reflect the cost of slippage to the Commonwealth without time limit, noting this needs to be negotiated for each contract.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department agrees that assessment of schedule should ignore advance progress of activities not on the critical path, but cautions against overly simplistic critical path analysis. The Project Office produces aggregate reports for the Project and Submarine 01, but these have limited value for determining schedule. Reports showing progress of elements and activities have much greater value and are used for assessing progress and initiating corrective actions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NSP employs a comprehensive range of information systems which are generally more advanced than those found in other major projects. The evolution of Management Information Systems for projects is ongoing and is given a very high priority. Requirements are generally tailored to meet the individual needs of projects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Project Office analyses Production Baseline Revisions in accordance with contract requirements and management needs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth's position in relation to agreement to schedule revision and the effect of this agreement on any future delay-related damages claims is determined by numerous factors including consideration of its legal position. Advice provided by the Attorney-General's Department indicates that the position is complex and that any claim would need to be considered on its merits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Risk of increased costs through contract amendments</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response to findings</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As described previously, the majority of the risk lies with ASC and there is no evidence that the Commonwealth has been substantially disadvantaged in its negotiations with ASC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In overall project cost terms, changes have accounted for a small portion of the work under the Contract, some 15% which includes ILS work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For all CAPs, the Commonwealth has been provided with adequate visibility of data and information and has been satisfied that overall the agreements reached have been fair and reasonable. It is acknowledged that time is often of the essence to avoid consequential penalties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All CAPs covering engineering changes are complex and require professional judgements regarding the estimation of cost vis a vis the performance, schedule, quality and safety aspects. ASC is largely a project management organisation with more than 80% of its work subcontracted to more than 170 equipment suppliers. Many of these companies in turn rely on hundreds of other lower tier subcontractors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is inevitable that ASC has relied on quotations from Kockums, both the designer of the submarines and shareholder in ASC. The matter of consortium arrangements and the potential for conflict of interest was addressed by the Defence Source Definition Committee during source selection.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A cost reimbursement approach to pricing for changes is not supported. Theoretically, contract amendments priced on a cost reimbursement basis would allow visibility of supporting information for ASC costs. In practice it would be impossible to separately measure the costs of implementing such changes during the construction of the submarines. Such changes would also undermine the fixed price basis of the contract with the consequence of risk being transferred to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response to recommendations</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under a fixed priced contract, all work is required to be included under the general scope of the contract. It is simply not practicable to negotiate changes as a separate issue or in isolation, as such negotiations do not occur in a competitive environment and the changes themselves are intrinsically linked to the product specifications and overall contract schedule. In all negotiations involving changes, there is always some common ground and leverage on both sides.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The contract requires the Contractor to provide additional supplies on similar terms and conditions; requires pricing for Contract Amendment Proposals to be supported by evidence; permits Commonwealth investigation to establish reasonableness; and, requires the Contractor to warrant that the CAP presents the total impact on the Contract. The Project Office will pursue with ASC the additional certification requirements recommended by ANAO.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the view of the Department, contractors involved in fixed price contracts are unlikely to agree to ANAO access to their accounting records. The Department is nonetheless reviewing its own need to have access to cost data in major, high risk contracts, noting there are strong arguments against such access for fixed price contracts won in strong competition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department is satisfied with the ability of the Project Office to negotiate Contract Amendments with ASC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consideration of opportunity costs will be taken into account for future Contract Amendments where appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department considers it is not practicable for many contract amendments to be costed separately by a contractor during implementation particularly where the contract is a fixed price.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">General issues noted</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response to recommendations</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth normally establishes certain minimum commercial terms and conditions as a baseline to assist Contractors in framing their offers. It is not practicable to expect Contractors to agree all such terms and conditions in advance of their offers. The development of terms and conditions should be progressed in a strong and sustained competitive environment as was achieved for the Project.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department notes the recommendation that it take into account the implied profit provided by the transfer of title in the Construction Facility in analysing the performance and position of ASC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department considers that, overall, the Project Office has maintained a balanced perspective throughout the period of the contract. The JSPCA recommendations of 1986 advised against tangential management initiatives such as reliance on a semi-autonomous business management function. The Department will nonetheless review the financial delegations for more significant contract amendments, within the Acquisition and Logistics organisation's chain of responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Training programs are continuously refined to meet project needs. The concept of opportunity cost will be further developed to meet possible future requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Project management systems are continuously refined and developed to meet specific needs. Consultants are engaged where necessary. The Department will review the criteria for such systems for future projects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department normally develops transition and in-service support arrangements for all new equipments in procurement. It is anticipated that acquisition of long-term maintenance services for the submarines will be arranged through the Naval Support Command consistent with industry and contract policy guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Summary</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's policy of greater self-reliance depends on Australia being able to compete internationally in selected areas of high value added industrial production. The Submarine Project was seen to provide Australian industry with an excellent opportunity to demonstrate its capability to support high technology defence platforms and systems, and to break into related international markets such as the potentially large market in the South-East Asian region for electronics and defence systems. It should also provide Australian companies, with demonstrated capabilities of quality and reliability in defence production, opportunities in other commercial work. These opportunities are gradually being realised by Australian companies involved in the Submarine Project.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANAO Report contains no suggestion of any wrong doing, corruption or fraud. The majority of findings reflect differences in opinion between ANAO and the Department. Given the complexity, magnitude, cost and inherent risk of the Project, this is not unexpected nor is it cause for misgivings about the development or management of the Project.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The key issue for Defence, ANAO and ASC in this project is whether the submarines will be completed on time, within the approved estimated project cost and to the performance requirements specified for them. Both the Department and ASC, with the benefit of their fulltime involvement in the Project for the past five years, are confident in their ability to tackle the remaining risks in the Project and meet all three objectives.</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am most grateful to the Senate and to the honourable senators who have allowed me to incorporate that document. I will not repeat what is contained in it, but I do think it addresses some of the issues here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Audit Office has also raised many new points and comments on the Department's response which have not been discussed at all with the Department. Again, I think that is poor methodology. I am pleased to see that the report is at least in printed form, because the original intention was simply to table a photocopy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The submarine project is a complex project, both in technical and commercial terms. I appreciate that auditors who have never seen a submarine or been associated with a project management would have some difficulty in coming to grips with the issues. The Audit Office has done a good job, considering its lack of experience of, and expertise in, these projects but it would have been better for the Audit Office to have taken more time to be educated on these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move to the question of the overall judgment of the project. The report concentrates on certain financial aspects and strikingly avoids any overall balanced judgment of the project. The project was always a high risk one and openly entered into by the Government with that knowledge. The biggest risk was always known to be in the technical engineering areas. Indeed, it is the technical risk which generates most of the schedule and cost risks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lost in the Audit Office reports is the significance of its implicit finding that the technical aspects of the project have been well managed by the project office. It is extraordinary that, in an audit of a $5 billion project, whose risks are primarily technology driven, the Audit Office should be so superficial about this issue. It is not just that this side of the project has been handled well&mdash;and credit should be given where credit is due. This still remains, and always would remain, the biggest area of risk. The failure of the audit team to consider how much risk remains and whether it has been rigorously and sensibly pursued is a culpable offence, in my view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department's review, backing the project office and the Australian Submarine Corporation&mdash;and this is the key part of what I have to say tonight&mdash;is that the submarine is on time, and it is on budget with an enhanced performance. That is the essence of what a fixed price contract is about. It seems to me that what the Auditor is yearning for is a cost plus contract and they have proved to be disastrous in the past. The Auditor and the audit do not directly dispute the contention I have just put down that it is on price, and on cost with enhanced quality. The report sort of says, `Look, we're a bit unsure about whether it is on schedule'. It cannot really argue one way or the other. It does not suggest the project is at serious risk of going beyond its budget, but suggests a new performance measure because commercial project management would not be satisfied with completing a major project within a fairly generous budget; noting, of course, that the budget reflects that the Australian Submarine Corporation's fixed price was developed in a strong competition. I do not believe that is a balanced judgment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one in Defence is saying the project has no risk, nor is anyone suggesting Defence should not pursue the best possible financial and performance result. But surely we can expect a major audit to give us a serious judgment on how the project is going on schedule, cost and performance and whether it is in line with the original budget estimate and performance requirements. If that is the case, the report should have said so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us move to some of the key criticisms. Many of the Auditor-General's comments are made with the benefit of twenty-twenty hindsight. There is no recognition that the contract was won after fierce competition. The alternative tenderer sought nearly double the up-front funding to ASC. The up-front funding to ASC was negotiated downwards from its winning bid before the contract was signed. The Government, through the contract, was establishing a new consortium and a new industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The contract was signed only after the most exhaustive process which included Defence committees, the Department of Finance and the Attorney-General's Department. The Audit Office suggests that, somehow, in a fixed price contract, the Government should monitor in detail a contractor's cash flow and should claim back up-front funds not directly required. We can certainly look at that in future, but let us not pretend that such an arrangement will not affect the contract price or the sharing of risks between the Commonwealth and the contractor. The issues are not simple and I am concerned that the Audit Office comments do not reflect commercial experience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Audit Office also expresses concern about the Australian Submarine Corporation's dividend payments. A graph on page 10 of the report highlights the company's profits and dividends compared with the shareholders' assets. I stress that this is a $5 billion project in an industry effectively created by the Commonwealth. To suggest that the contractor's risk is merely the shareholders' capital of $10m and that the profits ought only to relate to that is plain silly. The more important question is whether the dividend payments increase the Commonwealth's risk to any significant degree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is, with the advice of the Department of Finance and the Attorney-General's Department, the Department has a substantial financial guarantee. If the contract circumscribed dividend payments, presumably there would have to be some contract cost involved. The real issue is whether the overall array of financial guarantees&mdash;mortgaging and vesting&mdash;provide sufficient insurance for the Commonwealth. Unfortunately, that issue was not adequately discussed because of the Audit Office's self-imposed deadline. The Audit Office's comments on the Department's response has not been seen before but the Department's position has the support of the Attorney-General's Department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other major criticism concerns contract amendments and the claim that the Commonwealth has paid more than it should. I do not intend to go into all the details here; that is a matter for the Department to handle in due course. It is clear that the rights and wrongs in this area are heavily dependent on technical considerations which the Audit Office does not appear to be in a strong position to judge. I am also concerned that the Audit Office does not appear to appreciate some of the commercial aspects of this area. There is a suggestion that, somehow, contract amendments can be negotiated by the Commonwealth from a position of strength and that greater use should be made of cost based funding arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issues here are complex but I am concerned that the Audit Office's proposals could, in fact, add to the Commonwealth's costs and risks and remove the benefits of a fixed price contract. Again, time has not allowed the Audit Office and the Department to sensibly discuss these issues. The Audit Office also raises concerns over opportunity costs. There is no evidence here that the problem is a significant one for the submarine project. There is no appreciation of the consequences of pursuing opportunity costs in a fixed price contract such as might arise from the Commonwealth telling a contractor how to schedule and manage detailed work packages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said all that, I am not trying to cover up the fact that some mistakes have been made with the project. It would be unrealistic to expect nothing to go wrong in a $5 billion project. My firm view is that the Department has come a long way in its project management capacity in the last decade. The submarine project is a considerable advance on the past and, might I say, a considerable advance in any comparable project being built overseas. This report has made a number of very worthy recommendations which I have asked my Department to look at closely and which will improve the management of the project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another area involved, and that is the Australian Submarine Corporation itself, which the Auditor did not talk to, yet which has taken some big hits in his report&mdash;so much so that it may well dent its credibility in trying to market the submarine overseas. I will briefly put on the record some of the views from the Australian Submarine Corporation and seek, in due course, permission to incorporate its press release. Don Williams, the Managing Director of the Australian Submarine Corporation, has expressed his concern about the report, particularly its suggestion that his company is intent only on short term gain at the expense of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Williams has stated publicly that the Australian Submarine Corporation's first objectives are to deliver a quality product and to achieve budget profit margins and that the ASC does not see itself as a single contract company. I can certainly believe him in this because I have seen him make investments in South Australia, and in Newcastle, and explore possibilities at the moment in Western Australia. Dr Williams has also stated that the Audit Office fails to appreciate the commercial reality of staying in business based on quality and integrity. In other words, Dr Williams is saying that the corporation will not have its reputation besmirched by poor quality work, cost overruns et cetera when it intends to stay in the shipbuilding and associated industries into the long and distant future. I also know that his view is that the overall management of this project by the Department and the Navy has been a remarkable achievement in the face of substantial risk and a wide range of knockers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said at the opening of my remarks, I felt, because of the nature of this particular report, that I needed to put some of the counter-claims on the record.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">December 17, 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL AUDIT OFFICE (ANAO) REPORTS ON THE NEW SUBMARINE PROJECT</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following the tabling of the above report in Federal Parliament on 17 December 1992, the Australian Submarine Corporation Pty Ltd (ASC) would like to point out two important facts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. ASC has signed a lump-sum contract (subject to escalation based on CPI and currency movements) for the design and manufacture of six new submarines for the Royal Australian Navy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This means that, irrespective of the work involved in designing and building the six submarines, ASC is required to deliver them at the agreed price, on an agreed schedule.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The contract was awarded to ASC following a competitive bidding process between ASC and Australian Marine Systems (AMS); ASC and AMS having been selected from seven proposals based on designs from UK, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden and the Netherlands. The contract was negotiated in a climate of intense competition; with all aspects being finalised with both ASC and AMS, before final source selection was made by the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Five years after commencement of the contract:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the project remains on schedule&mdash;SM#01 will be launched on 28 August 1993</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the project remains within the original Commonwealth Government budget</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the submarines will meet, and in some cases exceed, the performance requirements laid down in the contract</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the Australian Industry Involvement program specified under the contract is being exceeded.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. ASC is a private company&mdash;not a government organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Like any other company contracted to provide services to the Government, it remains independent of the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accounting and tax standards require ASC to declare a profit on an ongoing basis and pay tax annually. It logically follows that when a private company has declared its profit and paid tax, it finally pays dividends.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ASC is proceeding with its foreshadowed plans for diversification and acquisition, so that the company can consolidate as a new major manufacturer of complex equipment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is very important to note that the Australian Submarine Corporation is rapidly building up to become a major Australian shipbuilding and heavy engineering company. This is being achieved through acquisitions which include the former Carrington Slipways in Newcastle and T. O'Connor &amp; Sons Pty Ltd in Adelaide. Negotiations also are progressing in regard to the establishment of a presence for ASC in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Business plans are being developed which identify work for these facilities, and for the submarine facility at Osborne. This is entirely based upon the reputation ASC has established for project management, quality engineering, systems integration, on time schedule performance and as a leader in the application of integrated logistic support techniques which ensure maximum availability of high technology equipment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a final comment, ASC is disappointed that the ANAO report contains direct comment on its activities, particularly when at no stage did ANAO audit staff contact ASC with questions or requests for comment.</PARA>

I understand that some members of the Opposition have an interest in going to a meeting that might be conducted in the not too distant future and that they would like to organise the business to facilitate that. It is very much in the Government's interest as well to proceed in this way because we are proposing to move more expeditiously to Government Business and legislation. The downside is that I accept that it is possible that it will reduce some of the time pressure on people speaking on reports because there is not the pressure of subsequent business, but it may be that the pressure of the hour and their colleagues' ire will compensate.

I just assure those concerned that those messages will not include at this stage the migration Bill, which we will do a few minutes subsequently. Also, in order to clarify things for people who are trying to time their arrival here, the first item of Government Business will be finalising the seafarers legislation, and we will then proceed to deal with the migration package following the presentation of the message from the House.

<PARA>This is the seventeenth report of the Committee concerning a matter raised by persons under Privilege Resolution 5 of 25 February 1988. On 14 December 1992, the President, Senator the Hon. Kerry Sibraa, referred to the Committee a letter from Ms Margaret Piper of the Refugee Council of Australia, on her own behalf and on behalf of Ms Eve Lester and Mr Seth Richardson, relating to remarks made by Senator McKiernan to the Senate on 7 December 1992. Ms Piper wrote to the President on 9 December 1992, and the matter was referred to the Committee as a submission under Privilege Resolution 5.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wish to avail myself and my colleagues of the provision that exists for the Senate Committee of Privileges to examine remarks made by Senator Jim McKiernan in the Senate on 7 December 1992 relating to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Ms Margaret Piper, Executive Director of the Refugee Council of Australia (RCOA);</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Ms Eve Lester, Co-ordinator of the Refugee Advice and Casework Service (RACS) Victoria;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Mr Seth Richardson, Co-ordinator, RCOA Port Hedland Project.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is our belief that many of the remarks made by Senator McKiernan were inaccurate and that they impugn our reputation and that of the organisations we represent. To answer specific points raised:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">". . . the Refugee Advice and Casework Service, which includes the Refugee Council of Australia" (<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> p4307)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Richardson and Ms Piper are members of RCOA; Ms Lester is Co-ordinator of RACS. It is inaccurate to say that the Refugee Advice and Casework Service includes the Refugee Council. RCOA is an umbrella organisation; RACS is one of the services operated by RCOA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"Eve Lester, Ms Margaret Piper and Mr Seth Richardson earned the accolade of being perhaps the worst set of witnesses that have ever appeared before a parliamentary inquiry. They did not want to answer any questions. . . we did not get direct answers to our questions." (<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard </EMPHASIS>p4307).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These comments imply that in our evidence to the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations we were being purposely evasive and trying to disguise the truth. We attempted to answer as accurately as possible, and to the best of our knowledge, the questions that were put to us. There were times, however, that their questions appear to us to be vague or misdirected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.". . . they purported to be experts in the area." (<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> p4307)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In response to the question from the Acting Chairman about the capacity in which we were appearing, Ms Lester advised that she was present in her capacity as Co-ordinator of the Refugee Advice and Casework Service. Neither Mr Richardson nor I was given the opportunity to answer this question because the Acting Chairman asked an unrelated question; the original question was not returned to.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4."We were insulted on a number of occasions. . . " (<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> p4307)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe that we did not insult the members of the committee and we cannot find what could be described as an insult in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record. On the contrary, we found that the method of questioning was at times aggressive and with frequent interruptions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was also an occasion when Senator McKiernan made a direct attack on Ms Piper's integrity and that of RCOA on the basis of a misinterpretation of a previous remark. Ms Piper's efforts to correct Senator McKiernan's perception of what she said were interrupted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"Ms Margaret Piper is doing herself and her organisation a great disservice in making such statements (referring to a quotation from evidence to the inquiry) on the record. . . . The conditions in Port Hedland are nowhere near what they are in Hong Kong or in many of the other refugee camps around the world." (<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> pp2307-2308).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator McKiernan has failed to recognise that Ms Piper's remarks related not to the nature of the buildings but to what happens there. A facility that is appropriate for short term accommodation for workers is not necessarily appropriate for long term detention of men, women and children, especially when one considers the fact that they are locked in behind barbed wire fences and under 24 hour a day guard.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">". . . We asked direct questions of Mr Richardson and Ms Piper in this Committee to ascertain how much they were getting out of the public purse. Organisations such as theirs do have a vested interest because they exist on government funding. The initial answer to our questions on the matter of funding was that it was $55,000. Through persistent further questioning we got agreement that the funding was in the region of half a million dollars." (<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> p4308)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The answer $55,000 (plus $30,000) was the correct answer to the question asked ie the amount of money received by RACS. Our attempts to explain the difference between the funding allocations to RACS and RCOA were interrupted by further questions. It was never our intention to disguise the figures and in fact we had brought the figures to the inquiry (as evidenced by their presentation) in case we were asked for them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">". . . what a difficult task the Standing Committee had in trying to elicit accurate and factual information from this body." (<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> p4309)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If Senator McKiernan was concerned about the accuracy of the evidence we presented to the inquiry, he could have approached us directly or taken more formal measures. Instead he has made these very serious accusations under the privilege of parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"I also doubt very much whether they are getting the proper legal service that they should be getting." (<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> p4309)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a particularly serious accusation impugning the competence and professional ethics of the lawyers involved in the projects, including Ms Lester and Mr Richardson. Senator McKiernan presented no evidence to substantiate these comments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is relevant to note that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.there have been no complaints made by the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (DILGEA) about the quality of the legal advice offered to the asylum seekers;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the asylum seekers have made no complaints about their legal advice from RCOA and RACS;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.The lawyers' actions with respect to their client have been vindicated by the results of judicial action thus far, in particular the High Court decision of 8 December 1992;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.DILGEA has recently awarded a contract following the first tendering process to RCOA for the provision of legal advice to the Romanian asylum seekers in Port Hedland. If there were concerns about the quality of the advice we were offering, it is reasonable to assume that they would not have awarded us this contract.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If Senator McKiernan has grounds for these remarks, he may take his complaints to the appropriate bodies, namely the Law Institute and the Law Society. To our knowledge, he has not done so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are submitting this document in an effort to put on the public record the facts as we see them in the hope that the issue can be addressed constructively and we can proceed towards finding a resolution to the very serious problems that exist in the area of refugee determination.</PARA>

Getting any information from them was truly like extracting teeth. Even when one asked direct questions it was extremely difficult to get a direct answer as these people were weaving their way all around the place. In one instance I made the comment that I doubted very much whether they were getting the proper legal service that they should be getting. I was referring, of course, to the asylum seekers that are held at various detention centres around Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, that is an accurate description of where we had reached. It lacks some of the pageantry of what we were doing. We were within nano seconds of concluding a hands-across-the-chamber agreement, I think. The synopsis is that Senator Panizza had moved a motion, Senator Bell had supported it, I had poked a few holes in it, we had agreed to resolve the difference and then the sitting was suspended. In the interim we have resolved the difference, I think. Any one of us&mdash;Senator Panizza, Senator Bell or I&mdash;could be the one who actually moves the outcome. But since what is formally before you, Mr Chairman, is Senator Panizza's motion, it seems to fall to me to move it and I do not in any way shirk from that.</PARA></TALK.START>

I trust, if I might interpolate at this point, the Minister thinks always the appropriate ones are the representative ones and not some others. Further, subclause 1B provides that a failure to consult as required by subclause 1A does not affect the validity of a regulation prescribing an amount for the purposes of this section. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition believed in the first place that its amendment, which was agreed to by the Democrats, covered the situation. I believe that this new amendment, the amendment to our amendment, has made it rather unnecessarily complicated. We believe that the Minister has a regulatory function, that the employers have a commercial responsibility to have the money there in the event that certain things happen and that the employees are the beneficiaries. In fact, Martin Byrne at the hearing the other night of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure on the Bill did not seem to place much importance on or did not say much about our amendment. So I presume that he accepted, as long as the money was there, that everything was okay.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe what we are talking about is simply a matter of mechanics. It seems to have been well established in all the discussions that the money will be there. We are taking out that $1m and replacing it with `the prescribed amount'. Whether employees are included or whether the employer organisations are included, the Minister can consult with who he likes. I am sure that he consults with his Department and with those who he thinks necessary outside of the Department&mdash;and I believe he could have consulted with anyone, employees especially, without amending my amendment. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill makes changes to provisions of Division 4B of the Migration Act, which deals with the custody of people who come to Australia by boat without prior authorisation. The changes proposed are interim measures until the commencement of the relevant provisions of the proposed Migration Reform Act 1992 in November 1993, which establishes a new and simplified regime for dealing with all unlawful persons, irrespective of their mode of entry to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Honourable Senators may recall that in May this year the Minister presented a Bill to the House designed to ensure that people who arrive by boat in Australia without prior authorisation remain in custody until they leave Australia or are granted an entry permit. The Minister believed then, and continues to believe, that only those granted authority to enter should be permitted to move into the general community, and that a clear signal be sent that entry into the Australian community cannot be achieved simply by arriving here.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Aspects of Division 4B were challenged in the High Court, which recently handed down its judgement validating the custody regime it sets out. The Minister applauds this very valuable decision, which clearly affirms the Government's right to maintain control over Australia's borders for the protection of the community as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The High Court decision did, however, uncover doubts as to the validity of custody under Section 88 of the Migration Act, in which most boat people were held before the commencement of the amended legislation on 6 May 1992. Section 88, which formed part of the major 1989 amendments to the Migration Act, replicates a long-standing provision in the earlier legislation. A majority of the judges held that detention ceased to be lawful under Section 88 after the destruction of the boat on which the person arrived or in other circumstances making the boat unavailable for the person's departure. While most of the boats on which the people in Section 88 custody arrived remain in existence, including the two boats on which the 37 plaintiffs before the High Court travelled to Australia, there is nonetheless considerable uncertainty now surrounding the lawfulness of Section 88 custody.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This uncertainty turns not on the central issue of unauthorised arrival, but on the haphazard fate of the boat on which the people travelled. Should custody have become unlawful, it is as a result of a technical breach. This has created an artificial situation when the fact of the matter is that the boat people arrived in Australia unlawfully and their detention was based on our understanding of the provisions of Section 88 at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Lawyers for the boat people are now publicly discussing compensation for unlawful detention, and already applications have been lodged in the High Court on behalf of some of the detainees. While our assumptions about the operation of Section 88 may have been misplaced, and the High Court has offered important guidance on this, the issue still remains to be tested in numerous cases. In the case of one boat, for example, the people were rescued at sea by the Royal Australian Navy as their boat foundered, and they were brought into Darwin on HMAS Townsville. One of the passengers rescued described their relief at being rescued in last Saturday's Weekend Australian. There must now be serious doubt about the custody of this group. It would be ironic if those rescued could now sue the Commonwealth for the privilege. Some 300 boat people in all are potentially affected. It is possible that, were a Court to find for these people, the Commonwealth could be ordered to pay a very considerable sum by way of compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister believes that it is essential to counter the possibility of significant damages claims. It would be absurd for the Australian taxpayer to be expected to underwrite compensation payments to people who had arrived here without authority and who had been detained on reasonable grounds while their claims to remain were exhaustively examined.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill therefore introduces a provision which limits any compensation payable to an amount of $1 per day for any period of detention which a Court of competent jurisdiction finds to have been unlawful. This will apply to all designated persons under Division 4B of the Migration Act, including those who have already commenced proceedings against the Commonwealth for damages in relation to claimed unlawful custody.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, this Bill seeks to put beyond doubt certain aspects of the custody scheme embodied in Division 4B of the Migration Act, in line with the guiding philosophy of that scheme:  namely that designated persons remain in custody until granted an entry permit or removed, subject only the proviso that the processing of entry applications must be completed within the time frame set down in the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Specifically, the Bill introduces a provision to put it beyond doubt that custody is to continue between the negative determination of an entry application and the removal of the applicant. While removal must be effected as soon as practicable after the entry application is refused and all appeals against, or reviews of, the refusal have been finalised, there are inevitable lead times in procuring travel documents and making associated arrangements. It is essential that there be legislative authority for continued custody through this period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also introduces a provision to extend the permissible period of custody where an entry application decision is reopened by an unfavourable ruling of the courts. This Bill provides that the period known as "application custody", which is limited to 273 days and which is intended to ensure that a decision is taken by the Department within that period, excludes any period of reconsideration following an adverse court ruling. The Bill provides an additional 90 days for each such reconsideration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also provides that the institution of proceedings in relation to unlawful custody does not prevent the Government from detaining or removing designated persons during the course of such proceedings. This Bill makes it plain that a stay order against removal may not be issued to allow an applicant to remain in Australia during the course of such proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, this Bill extends the coverage of the existing provisions under Division 4B to include people arriving by boat on or after 1 December 1992, up until the commencement of the new measures contained in the proposed Migration Reform Act 1992, which was passed recently by this Parliament. When Division 4B was enacted in May of this year, it was envisaged that the planned Migration Reform Act would commence on 1 December 1992 and therefore the amendments related only to boat people arriving before that date. As the relevant provisions of the proposed Migration Reform Act will not now commence until 1 November 1993, it is essential to extend the existing custody provisions to cover people arriving on or after 1 December 1992, but before 1 November 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate and I present the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition supports the Migration Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1992 and notes the need, as proposed by the Government in full consultation with the Opposition, for there to be certainty in the matter of the intention that we in this Parliament had when we adopted the Migration Act and its provisions as they now stand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, after we debated and passed this legislation in May this year and as a result of a High Court ruling with regard to a recent immigration case that came before it, there were some comments made by members of the Bench. From these comments, it appears that a number of the asylum seekers, people arriving by boat illegally on Australia's shore, may&mdash;and I stress the word `may'&mdash;have been unlawfully in custody under section 88 of the Act from the time they first entered Australia until the amendment was enacted. It is also possible&mdash;and I stress the word `possible'&mdash;that if they were unlawfully held a claim for damages could arise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The defect in section 88 which has given rise to this possibility was discussed by Justices Brennan, Deane and Dawson. It was suggested that detention is only authorised until the departure of a vessel carrying the alien from Australia or until such earlier time as an authorised officer directs. It is on the rub of when a boat bringing an illegal entrant arrives to the point when that boat departs that we have provisions in section 88 of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A situation has arisen which was not fully foreseen and which may&mdash;and I stress the word `may'&mdash;lead to a problem. That problem is this: in the particular case considered by the court, it was informed that the vessel had been burned by quarantine officials. The view of the court was that once a vessel no longer exists, or for that matter could never depart, the authority to detain a person lawfully might cease to have effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The High Court has a duty to adjudicate independently on the law as adopted by the Parliament. With all due respect to the High Court and courts at every level in this land, what we have is what I would see as a litigious game of hide and seek. Over the last 10 years we have had this litigious game of hide and seek not only in Australia but also in the United States and Canada, and a wide range of other countries which receive immigrants and which are subject to the phenomenon of illegal migration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would even say that well-intentioned lawyers seek to uphold what they see as the rights of illegal immigrants. They seek to find every loophole they can in immigration law in order to help their clients achieve the goal of gaining permanency in the country that they have chosen to come to illegally, without papers, without entry permits, without visas, and often without even passports. What is at issue in this game of hide and seek is in fact the national interest of Australia and the integrity of our immigration law. We must have a law that genuinely fulfils the intentions of the elected representatives in the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without seeking to provoke some honourable senators who might speak after me&mdash;and I see that Senator Harradine and Senator Chamarette are in the chamber&mdash;I wish to quote from the second reading speech of the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand). This is the same second reading speech as the one that has been incorporated in this place. I quote from page 3946 of the House of Representatives <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard </EMPHASIS>of 16 December 1992:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This uncertainty turns not on the central issue of unauthorised arrival, but on the haphazard fate of the boat on which the people travelled.</PARA>
<PARA>We need to understand this central fact. If the boat was burnt, put in a museum, as one boat was recently, or disposed of in some way, there is a possible interpretation that section 88 of the Migration Act no longer provides that the person who came on that boat can be lawfully detained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am a plain man. I am not into litigious hide and seek, except insofar as to try to win a battle on behalf of the people of Australia and on behalf of the intentions of the Parliament. I would say that there was never any intention by the Parliament to allow an escape from section 88 of the Act on such grounds. Let me mention just a few examples. One vessel that arrived in recent years was called the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Collie</EMPHASIS>. The 79 people on board were all illegal immigrants. This vessel could not depart from Australia because it was sunk. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Echo</EMPHASIS>, which had 10 illegal immigrants on board, was committed to a museum. It cannot leave Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another boat, called the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">George</EMPHASIS>, carried 77 illegal immigrants. It was burnt. Another boat, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Harry</EMPHASIS>, with 10 illegal immigrants, was sold and beached. The fate of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Dalmatian</EMPHASIS>, with 33 illegal immigrants, is unknown. Because of the haphazard outcome of what happens to such boats, are we trying to maintain that we will allow some lawyers to drive their coach and horses through a loophole in the law and break down the intentions of this Parliament and, indeed, the integrity of our immigration laws?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the doubt, it is necessary that there be certainty as to what the intention of this Parliament has been all along. This legislation applies to the period from 19 November 1989 to 1 November next year. After 1 November next year the provisions of the Migration Reform Bill, which we adopted recently, will make for certainty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that appeals to so-called human rights, appeals to the covenants on civil and human rights, or consideration of the rights of persons to be imprisoned or detained and the conditions under which they are detained, bear upon this matter as much as the haphazard nature of the outcome of the vessels on which they arrive in relation to the words that happen to exist in section 88 of the Migration Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have read carefully the House of Representatives speeches of the Minister, Mr Hand, and my close colleague, Mr Phillip Ruddock who is the honourable member for Dundas and the shadow Minister for immigration and ethnic affairs. I want to quote two sections of Mr Ruddock's speech. He calls this Bill `an important piece of legislation, designed to ensure that the provisions of the Migration Act, which were enacted last May, are valid'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have spoken on behalf of the Opposition in the last four or five debates on immigration law. A few years ago we were involved in the reformulation of the whole Act. We have sought to make the Parliament's intention clear in legislation, despite this litigious game of hide and seek. We do not in any way wish to see in the immigration law of Australia any breakdown of human rights, any discrimination, or any action that is inhumane or lacking in compassion. We want to see fairness, justice, truth and certainly integrity in the intended immigration law of Australia. Mr Ruddock is reported on page 3951 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it has always been clear that our principal problem has been the unduly legalistic approach that has had to be adopted because of the Government's view that we ought to provide ready access to judicial review of administrative decisions . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to talk about the creative way in which the High Court of Australia and other courts have got into the business of determining refugee claims and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for the reasons that have already been set out in the House of Representatives&mdash;and which I have repeated&mdash;that we wish to see the original intention of the Parliament in the amending Bill of May this year maintained, despite this litigious game of hide and seek.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The relevant section on which the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) sought to support his decisions in this area is section 88 of the Migration Act which sets out the provisions relating to stowaways where the presence or departure of their boat is obviously a significant factor. The Government sought to use that section to justify the continuing detention of the 37 boat people whose boat had been burned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government realised that it could not amend section 88 retrospectively. Rather than make an attempt to do that, it has brought in a provision in the current Bill which states: The compensation that may be awarded to a designated person in an action under subsection (2) is to be $1 for each day of the person's unlawful custody.</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister claims that the provision is not contrary to article 9.5 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which states that anyone who has been the victim of unlawful arrest or detention shall have an enforceable right to compensation. However, it is clear that this is mere subterfuge and that, in substance, this provision is contrary to the principles of international human rights guaranteeing the rule of law. </PARA>

It is my understanding that some of my colleagues, in particular Senator Coulter, who will be expressing his views shortly, may take a different view on this issue which in many ways is a conscience issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is hard to avoid being cynical as the Government yet again rushes into the Parliament to amend the legislation dealing with people seeking asylum in Australia by the Migration Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1992. If it were not so tragic to the people concerned, this could be categorised as the `Oops!' legislation. The Government has tried and tried again to make sure that gaining refugee status in Australia is well nigh impossible unless people come through proper channels and wait in the queue. But each time it has discovered that it has left a tiny window through which the light of justice and fairness can shine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, this legislation has come about because the High Court has ruled on the Government's policy of detention without recourse to court jurisdiction. In May of this year, we saw legislation rushed in here to head off a court challenge and now the Government again wants to make sure that the courts are not able to evaluate the legal validity of its policies. So it is time to try to close the window once more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In May of this year, we had the extraordinary situation of the Government insisting that even a court did not have the power to release someone held in custody by the Department. Why is this Government so hell-bent on this process which relies on detaining people against their will without recourse to the power of the courts to adjudicate on the merits of their detention? Whose interests are being served by this regime of detention without relief?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It costs the Australian community thousands of dollars per person held. Just for interest, at a very conservative estimate, the cost is $11,000 per person per year in Port Hedland and $27,000 per person per year at Villawood or elsewhere. This imprisonment reinforces antagonism towards these people in the community by making them seem different, not to say criminal, and denies people opportunities for overcoming the fears which they have sought to escape by coming here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Studies overseas have shown that, in countries where refugee applicants are not detained during their processing, only 3 per cent fail to appear for the various steps required for their application. But even putting aside the remote possibility that the Australian Government could come at that, we have groups in our community which are willing and ready to provide accommodation and support for these people and to see them through the application process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill seeks to clarify some other matters which managed to slip through the net last time. So the 273 day detention period during which the processing must be completed is now to be able to be extended by a further 90 days for each extra step of an appeal process. A person's detention may so become nine, 12 or 15 months. Where will it end? The Government says that it is committed to ensuring that people will not be held in custody for three years or longer, as has happened to a number of people, but it seems to want to have the right to punish people with extra detention if they choose to appeal a negative decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now also have the infamy of the Government setting people's right to compensation for illegal detention over the past few years at a paltry $1 per day. To add to the infamy, it recognises that a compensation claim can only proceed for the 104 people who fall within the High Court determination. But, nonetheless, it wants to limit the court's decision making powers by setting the level of compensation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One dollar per day is an insult to those who have been illegally detained. In fact, the notion of someone bringing such an action, making use of legal representation possibly costing thousands of dollars, is an obscenity. Is this the hallmark of a civilised and caring society? Australia has limited by this legislation its liability to a total of some $23,000 shared between 104 people potentially, yet may still spend 10 times that defending their obligation to pay it. Such is the stupidity of this Government's attitude towards this tiny number of unfortunate people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just to make it concrete, the Department of Immigration does not intend to contest the claim of 71 of these people whose boat is no longer in existence. This would amount to $300 compensation for each person for their 10 months unlawful detention. However, the Department of Immigration would be   prepared to contest the claims of the 33 people whose case for unlawful custody was upheld in the Federal Court and who, through this legislation, would potentially receive $60 per person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The total number of refugee applications from people currently in Australia exceeds 21,000. But this Government has singled out a small handful of less than 500 for all the harsh treatment, manipulation of our standard legal processes and, indeed, the skewing of our entire immigration agenda to boot. Why is the Australian Government so deeply committed to allowing only 5 per cent of refugee applications to succeed? When compared with other countries&mdash;Canada is an obvious example&mdash;why are we so miserly with onshore applications? Even if we were to accept all of those who are at present in detention centres, especially those who have been in custody for three years or more, would it make any significant difference to our immigration program? Of course not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 6 of the Bill also provides a catch-all clause to negate any further possibility of redress to the courts at a State or Federal level for unlawful custody apart from the compensation I have outlined above. One of the pillars of a free country is recourse to the courts, yet through the insertion of proposed new section 54RA(1) in the Act there can be no further opportunities for these 104 or any other refugees who arrived in Australia after 19 November 1989 to find any sort of remedy through court proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is another disgraceful episode in this Government's refugee policy blundering. It seeks to snuff out the light of hope for a just and fair hearing for those who leave their homelands in terror and despair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is happening to this country? What is happening in this Government and in this Parliament? It has become heartless and inhuman. This legislation and the decision making and motivation underlying it expose a serious value vacuum in our society. The stories that we hear from Germany regarding the resurgence of the neo-Nazi movement promoting jingoism and racism are not so far afield. In Australia, it is emanating from our government policies rather than from subversive minorities. Australia's international reputation is at risk. Our approach to refugees exposes totally our hypocrisy in decrying the human rights violations of other countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have mentioned once before in a different context, the problem with racism is that people who have racist values and attitudes have great difficulty acknowledging that they are racist. They believe firmly that they are right and that everyone else is wrong. They live in an encapsulated world of black and white values and concrete thinking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reasons underlying this Government's preoccupation with migration legislation from the point of view of its supporters is simple: this land is ours; only if people apply through the correct bureaucratic processes will they be given consideration of their civil rights and access to the due process of law; and if we are not strict in enforcing our borders, we will be inundated by hordes trying to take advantage of our lenience and steal from us the benefits of this land. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">White Australia has a black history. This paranoia that people will rush in and steal our land may well be related to the fact that European Australia stole this land from its Aboriginal occupants only 200 years ago.

In many cases, they got together enough money to bribe boat owners in order to illegally enter this country. We did not bring them in. In some cases, they could have applied through the normal refugee stream and sought refugee status, but they did not do that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the recently announced immigration program for 1992-93, there was considerable debate and consultation with the Australian community&mdash;taxpayers, ethnic groups, government departments and State governments&mdash;on what the intake for immigration ought to be in this current financial year, 1992-93. It was determined by government that it be 80,000 in total. Twelve and a half per cent of that would be made up of refugees, which is an increase in percentage terms from last year accounted for by the fact that, in the last financial year, the figure was 12,000. It has gone down to 10,000, but the overall program has been reduced from 110,000 to 80,000. The Government has stuck with its principle of looking after refugees. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This measure to deny these people their day in court was rushed through the House of Representatives and rushed through this place two days before the court case, without the Bill going to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. However, after the Bill was passed in October this year, the Scrutiny of Bills Committee did look at the Bill. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee said a number of things about the measure. As to the provision that a court is not to order the release from custody of a designated person, the Committee stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee suggested that the combined effect of new paragraph 54R(3)(e) and section 54S is that a `designated person' effectively would be denied access to the courts for the purposes of determining whether or not they should continue to be detained. The Committee suggested that this may be considered to be contrary to Article 9, paragraph 4 of the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights. . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Scrutiny of Bills Committee was drawing that to our attention, given its terms of reference. The terms of reference of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee include one which says that it must report in regard to Acts or Bills which trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties. The High Court found that it did trespass on these rights. I am suggesting to the Senate tonight that the courts will find parts of this legislation to be so trampling on the individual human rights of persons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am asking&mdash;unlike what the Parliament did last May&mdash;that this measure be allowed to go to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. As I said in the Senate on 7 December, the Government's treatment of refugees has been disgraceful, callous, uncivilised and bordering on the barbaric. Its handling of legislation in this area has been secretive and surreptitious as indicated by its latest actions in ramming this legislation through the House of Representatives in the early hours of this morning and expecting the Senate to kowtow to its wishes on this, the last day of the Parliament's sittings. If the Senate succumbs to these outrageous tactics with disregard for the rule of law and the rights of individuals and proper parliamentary procedures, it will be a day of shame. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Migration Amendment Bill (No. 4) which is before us tonight is, indeed, an extremely difficult piece of legislation from the point of view of conscience and from the point of view of balancing the appropriate demands of various sections of the community for justice and fairness. I have had a great deal of difficulty with this piece of legislation, but I have come down on the side different from that of my colleague Senator Spindler, whose position I very much respect. I can fully understand and fully sympathise with his position but, on balance, I have come down on the other side. I would like a few moments to explain why I have taken that position. I do not know what the position of my other colleagues will be, because I think this is very much a matter of conscience.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also repeatedly on record as saying that Australia should substantially increase its intake of refugees. The position of the Democrats has, for a long time, been one in which those who come here for economic reasons&mdash;either their own or the perceived economic advantage of Australia&mdash;should be pushed aside in favour of those who come here for humanitarian reasons. For those reasons we have argued against the business migration and skills migration program and have argued for a substantial increase in migration of refugees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support a point made by Senator Harradine. Section 88 of the primary legislation is one that should have been reviewed a long time ago. There is no doubt in my mind that the Department has been lax in not attending to this matter before, and to do it at this late hour is a long way from ideal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This situation has arisen because the High Court has ruled, as several other senators have said, that the part of the legislation recently passed through this Parliament in relation to the ability of the courts to order release from detention was invalid. In the course of that judgment, the Hight Court also passed some remarks about the availability of the means of egress from Australia being the means by which people came in here. It would seem that that part of the High Court decision does involve, as Senator Baden Teague pointed out, a considerable degree of arbitrariness in that, if the success of a case for compensation turns on whether the boats have been destroyed&mdash;and they may have been destroyed for very good reasons, say, of quarantine&mdash;then it seems a bad law that compensation should simply turn on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One example given to us in the second reading speech of the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) was that people were actually rescued and brought into Australia on a naval vessel and, because that naval vessel has gone back into international waters, their means of entry into Australia is no longer available to them. Therefore, having been rescued, through this arbitrary mechanism, they may be eligible for compensation. That seems unusual and unfair. It certainly is discriminatory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I spoke to Father Frank Brennan this afternoon, a person whom I very much admire and respect in this area. He points out that even if that leg of a claim were not to stand up, the claim might still stand in relation to the fact that section 88 was being used in an inappropriate way. He pointed out to me that that section was originally used in relation to people who had stowed away. They were, therefore, only likely to be detained for a very short time and then returned to the boat on which they had come in, and off they would go. He argues that it may well be that these people would be able to still sustain a case for compensation on the grounds that section 88 was being used in a way which was not intended originally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we are then left with a situation in which the number of people who may be eligible for compensation could be quite large. I understand the number is some 267 people. In my mind, that raises another issue of fairness and equity. If the amount of compensation is going to be very large, one must balance the demands on that amount of money for other perfectly good humanitarian needs in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chamarette in her contribution mentioned the Aboriginal people from whom we, the white people or Europeans, took this continent 200 years ago. One is aware of medical programs, health programs, education programs and a whole lot of other things that are underfunded in terms of the indigenous people of this country. Yet money might well be expended on people who are not Australian citizens but who have come here for their own reasons and who have not yet entered Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings me to the next point I want to raise. The word `detention' is used quite a lot in respect of these people. In a sense these people are not in detention. These people have not yet entered Australia. They are, as it were, in the same position as people in quarantine. They do not have visas or passports and they would enter Australia when they pass out of that place of detention through the gates with the appropriate paperwork. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the argument in relation to fairness and the extension of Australian law to those people who are not yet in Australia but who are claiming refugee status and whose status has not yet been determined, in my view, is no different from that of a refugee who may be living under equally horrible or even worse conditions who is also outside Australia and still in the country of origin or some third country. I have been to some fairly horrific refugee camps in such places as Jordan where Palestinian refugees are living. If we are to extend the rights of Australian law to potential refugees who have not yet entered Australia but who are in detention camps on Australian soil, it seems to me that we should logically extend Australian law to those refugees who are in detention camps who apply for refugee status while on Jordanian soil or some other soil. The issue of how far one extends this particular prerogative seems to me to have become extremely blurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us consider the situation of people who have, to use Senator McKiernan's term, `bought their way in'. These people have presumably had enough money to buy a boat to get to our shores. In respect of fairness and equity, I think it is fair to compare the rights of those people with the rights of those who do not have that facility and who are in refugee camps, say, in Jordan and who are going through the processes of applying to enter Australia as refugees. I think there is a real equation here that has to be weighed up very carefully. I have great difficulty in accepting the argument that, simply because people have been able to buy a boat and land on our shores unannounced, their rights should supersede the rights of those who are somewhere else and applying for entry. It seems to me that those people should be treated equally, and then either Australian law has to be extended to those people in terms of compensation if they are in detention or, if not, if they are of some other status, the appropriate course is to treat them as people who are applying for entry but who have not yet entered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another aspect in relation to detention is that these people are not like prisoners who are kept in gaol. They are perfectly free to go back to their country of origin in that I understand at every stage the offer is there for them to be flown back to their country of origin. They are therefore not quite in the same situation as somebody who is in gaol. They are being detained in terms of not being allowed across that border from the detention camp into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for those reasons that, on balance&mdash;and it is very much on balance&mdash;I am concerned that this legislation should be passed. I want to reflect again on the inadequate way that the Government, apparently over a quite long period, has dealt with this legislation so that continually we find these loopholes that need to be plugged at the last minute. That is a very unsatisfactory situation and one that I hope the Government will now give some attention to and review very quickly so that these things do not occur again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the reference to a committee&mdash;and this is the last item I want to pick up&mdash;it seems to me that if we refer this matter to a committee at this stage there will be in the interim a large number of applications before the courts and we will be very much in the situation that we were in last time, with the argument being put that we cannot change the situation once the matters are before the courts. So, if one perceives that this is a loophole, however unsatisfactory it is to close it in this arbitrary and peremptory way, I think it is better that it be done. I have great difficulty with this matter. I have spent many hours this afternoon worrying about this legislation. I fully sympathise with the position that has been taken by Senator Harradine, Senator Chamarette, Senator Spindler and probably some of my other colleagues, but, on balance, I have to say that on this one I come down on the other side. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just before the Minister sums up the whole debate, I thought it would be useful to speak on the amendment moved by Senator Harradine to refer the Bill to the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills rather than have it proceed tonight.

I believe the due parliamentary process needs to be observed at all times, even if a Bill is rushed through at the last minute&mdash;and perhaps even more so in that case. This is particularly the case with a Bill that proposes to vary the legal rights for a particular class of persons on Australian soil going before Australian courts&mdash;people who are to be denied their rights to challenge in court the amount of damages if they are found to have been unlawfully detained, and only in that case. I believe that that is a principle that needs examination before this chamber votes on it. It should not be determined in the hurry in which we are asked to do so tonight.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In setting the context for this debate, may I first absolutely reject the extravagant language of both Senator Chamarette and Senator Harradine. Senator Chamarette, for example, claimed that we were involved here in yet another expression of government sponsored resurgence of Nazism&mdash;that is what she said. She is speaking of a Government which, in the most difficult and trying times in the Australian community, still finds enough compassion&mdash;to use Senator Chamarette's terms&mdash;to permit entry and welcome to this country 10,000 refugees, who satisfy the humanitarian criteria.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what Australia does: we take 10,000 people into this country on humanitarian and refugee grounds every year, including during the last several years this Government has been in office. We do that with the support of the Opposition, and, I think, of the Australian community, despite hard times. We recognise the plight of tens of thousands of Cambodian refugees; we go to the border camps to assist them in coming to this country to find a future for themselves and their families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To speak of the record of this Government and the Australian community in those terms has to be utterly rejected as flying in the face of the facts. Also, Senator Harradine said that the Government was tonight inviting the Parliament to act in a racist way because these people were brown or yellow&mdash;that was what he said. But what about the Polish people who arrived unannounced in a vessel back in October? They were also assessed against the international criteria in a process which allowed, of course, for natural justice. They were found not to have satisfied the internationally accepted criteria relating to refugee status, their claim was not accepted and they were deported; they were returned to some other country. The fact is that that was done in an even-handed way. Those people were not brown or yellow. Senator Harradine's claim that this is racially motivated legislation must be utterly rejected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also suggested that we should find some solace in the words of Mr Justice Einfeld. Why Senator Harradine called him Mr Justice Einfeld, I do not know. I do not think he was acting in a judicial capacity or exercising judicial power when he made the remarks to which Senator Harradine referred. Apparently he said that the way in which we treated those seeking recognition for a claim for refugee status was `a shameful blot on our compassion and humanity' when, in fact, there is a most exhaustive process of assessment of such claims according to the principles of natural justice. Perhaps it is that exhaustive process which may be subject to criticism rather than the claim that we demonstrate a lack of compassion and humanity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the main argument of Senator Harradine, and perhaps other senators, is really directed against any detention at all while the claims of these people who arrive unannounced are being assessed. Whether the detention is lawful or unlawful is, in a sense, a secondary matter to the major objection to the process of holding people in detention for a period&mdash;which has in some instances been lengthy&mdash;whilst the claims are being dealt with. As I say, I reject the general claims that have been put in a such way as to colour the argument and try to move people to oppose this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I admire Senator Coulter for exposing the way in which he wrestled with and tackled the various arguments that can be put in relation to this legislation. It is not straightforward to give unambiguous adherence to what is put forward tonight by the Government to the Parliament as a way of dealing with a very difficult situation. But the fact is that we were faced with the High Court decision, which expressed a view as to the lawfulness or unlawfulness of the custody of certain persons who were held, it was intended, under section 88 of the Migration Act. The majority of the judges indicated their view that that detention or custody ought to be characterised as unlawful if the vessel on which the people arrived was no longer available to take them back into international waters; basically, that is what it amounted to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think Senator Coulter was the one who made a very telling comment when he said that, for example, if two boat loads of people came into the same inlet in north-west Western Australia, one vessel riddled with some disease-bearing organism which justified destruction by the quarantine authorities in order to preserve the Australian community from the encroachment of some exotic disease which could do great damage to our pastoral industries or to our human health, and the other vessel not so riddled and therefore able to be tied up at a wharf when seized by the various authorities concerned, those people who were on the boat that was destroyed in order to protect the Australian community would now have a claim for damages, for compensation from the Australian community in relation to their detention&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;whereas the others would not. This is really an absurd situation. I do not see anything untoward in the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia saying&mdash;and I emphasise this&mdash;not that there is an interference with the judicial power, with the right of the court to determine whether the detention was unlawful&mdash;that is still a very proper, central, primary task of the bench of judges who will be approached in relation to these matters&mdash;but that the bench of judges will decide whether the detention was lawful or unlawful in accordance with the criteria which has been pointed to by the High Court in relation to section 88; that is their primary function. It is not being stripped away.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All that the Parliament is being asked to do this evening in relation to a decision made by a court that the detention was unlawful is to limit and restrict the quantum of the compensation. In that way, the interests of the Australian community will be properly protected by decision of the Parliament. That would be a justifiable approach which would be well understood within the Australian community which we represent; not in a racist, xenophobic way and not in a neo-Nazi way, but in a simple way to recognise the needs of the Australian community and the capacity of the Australian community to deal with the consequences of the High Court decision in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter again gave the example of persons being rescued at sea. Consider this for a moment. HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Townsville</EMPHASIS> rescued persons at sea from a boat that would otherwise have sunk and they would have perished in the waters close to Australia. They were brought into Darwin. But, because the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Townsville</EMPHASIS> had to then go on other duties and was therefore not available to take these people back into international waters or back to their country of origin, their transit country or whatever, should a large compensation package be offered to them for the period that they were detained unlawfully if that is what a court determined their detention to be? Does anyone seriously suggest that the Australian community should now offer a large compensation package in respect of those persons who were saved from perishing by an Australian naval vessel? It is just absolutely absurd. It is just absolutely absurd when those whose boat did not founder and who came into the Port of Darwin and tied their boat up to the wharf would not have such a claim against the Australian people for compensation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill is saying that, in the situation where we have that consequence, there is a limit to the compensation to be determined by the Parliament. That limit is justifiable and, I believe, can be supported in good conscience by senators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, Senator Harradine says, `Well, perhaps the matter should be sent to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee'. As one of the founders and, if not the inaugural chairman, certainly an early chairman, of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, I think I understand its role reasonably well. Its role was to alert the Parliament&mdash;the Senate chamber in particular&mdash;to those instances where legislation might otherwise escape scrutiny, and a provision or some effect or impact on the rights of those who would be subject to the Bill might not be noted in a way which would allow proper debate in the chamber before a decision was made on whether to give support to the Bill concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not the case tonight. Senators know the situation. We are having a very vigorous debate, which I think just exemplifies my point.

I suppose it is possible that somebody may have sneaked in in the interim, over the last couple of weeks. I cannot deny that is a possibility.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to ask the Minister to respond to a question that was put by Senator Harradine in his speech. Senator Harradine spoke of the incongruity of the determination of compensation being made by the perpetrators of the particular unlawful offence. I would also like the Minister to comment on proposed new section 54RA, which refers to compensation. How will this place Australia in relation to article 9.5 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which states that where a person has been detained unlawfully they shall have an enforceable right to compensation?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Chamarette will not find a provision in this Bill saying that the Executive will determine the limit of compensation. The whole point of the exercise is that we are asking the Parliament to determine the limit and the amount or quantum of compensation. So the rhetoric of Senator Harradine is really ill founded. It is not simply the Executive making a decision as to the quantum. We come into the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia asking it to pass that particular provision, which Senator Chamarette will find on page 3 of the Bill. Clause 6, 54RA(3) reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The compensation that may be awarded to a designated person in an action under subsection (2) is to be $1 for each day of the person's unlawful custody.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a provision which is to be given statutory status if it is passed by the Parliament; it is not an executive matter. As to the question of the international covenant, the Government is not stripping away the right to compensation. It is, as I said, setting a level of compensation, a quantum, but it is not denying the process, most importantly, of allowing a judicial tribunal to determine whether the detention was unlawful or not. That is a basic judicial function. As to the quantum, that is being dealt with in the way suggested in the Bill and the Government does not believe that that is at variance with the international covenant which the honourable senator mentioned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with the Minister. Senator Chamarette appears to be quoting from Senator Harradine's press release of today which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government was the perpetrator of the illegal detention&mdash;now it sets itself up as the judge of what compensation is to be made.</PARA>
<PARA>When I read that I had the same response&mdash;that it is the Parliament that is determining the law. It is the Parliament that is setting the limit on compensation. I can only say in concert with the Minister, Senator Tate, to Senator Harradine and Senator Chamarette that they seem not to have grasped the burden, the central element, of this legislation which I tried to explain as clearly as I could and, of course, as Senator Tate did in summing up this second reading debate. I think Senator Coulter got to the kernel of the legislation. It is the arbitrariness of seeing an avenue to compensation never intended by this Parliament and the arbitrariness of that avenue opening up as a loophole on the grounds that the boat on which they arrived may not any longer exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we could have all sorts of semantics for another half an hour. I do not wish to rise again, but I just want to say that there is no point of difference with regard to this legislation between the Government and the Opposition. The Government and the Opposition have an approach to the integrity of Australia's immigration law which seems to have been lost by my good friends Senator Chamarette and Senator Harradine. I can only appeal to them not to create straw men by the questions they ask of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I am on my feet, I will refer to the amendment that has been circulated by Senator Harradine. The amendment would require the Minister to respond within 28 days to any application for refugee status and the granting of a permanent entry permit on the basis of strong humanitarian grounds. The Opposition believes that the legislation is adequate and we will not support that proposed amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find that extraordinary and indicative of a closed mind approach towards this matter. Senator Teague has just stated that he would vote against an amendment that has been circulated but not moved. He has not given me the courtesy of hearing any arguments that I might advance in favour of that measure. I will come back to that in a minute.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also take note of Senator Teague's statement that the Opposition and the Government are at one in this matter. I wonder whether, in their hearts, all of the Opposition and all of the Government are at one in this matter, particularly in its legal consequences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point I want to briefly mention without arguing about it is the statement by Senator Teague that we should not carry on with semantics and we should not raise straw men. I have heard a few semantics around this chamber tonight&mdash;one being the suggestion that certain boat people would be discriminated against in that they would not be able to claim that they were illegally detained because they had been brought into Australia by a ship of the Australian Navy which rescued them. That is arguable anyhow because that ship, as I understand it, has left Australian shores. I will not get into that argument. That is semantic argument for the purposes of this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The faults in the legislation are not the fault of the refugees. They are not straw men; they are real people who have suffered in their own country and suffered at the hands of this Government in Australia. I remind the chamber that church groups and community groups appealed to the Government to allow these people to be released into their custody and on their cognisance and the Government deliberately and callously refused that request. We cannot blame the refugees for seeking to go to the courts to be released from detention. I am not talking about semantics. Does proposed new section 54RA(1) remove a person's common law right to claim damages for false imprisonment?</PARA>

The Minister said that proposed new section 54RA(1) removes a person's common law right to take a damages action for false imprisonment. If it can be done for these people, it can be done again for others.

I remind the chamber that proposed new section 54RA(2) substitutes for a person's common law right a right to paltry compensation that is technically determined by this Parliament but which we all know is determined by the Government. I restate what I said because it is accurate: the perpetrator of the actions which kept these people in unlawful detention has set itself up as the judge of the amount of compensation that will be paid to its victims. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Harradine has raised various matters. I will return to the question of proposed new section 54RA(1) and the question of the retrospective effect of unlawful imprisonment, as it was put, that would take away the right to sue for damages in relation to unlawful detention. I re-emphasise what I said before: the question of the unlawful detention, the false imprisonment, is still proper for a court to determine. Nothing in this Bill affects that. I simply want to emphasise that what is negated is the usual method of receiving an award of damages from the court should the detention be found to be unlawful. Senator Harradine then moved to proposed new section 54RA(3) to talk about the provision for compensation. He reiterated what is patently untrue. Perhaps I cannot put it that way; I beg his pardon.</PARA></TALK.START>

This is a case where&mdash;to once again return to the second reading debate but not to linger on it&mdash;the unlawfulness of the detention or custody depends on a set of circumstances which, I submit, are quite different to the sort of unlawful detention that might occur if a Federal police officer, without any cause whatsoever, simply took somebody off the street and held that person against his or her will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An example put by some&mdash;no doubt it would be tested in a court&mdash;is that of a Royal Australian Navy vessel rescuing a foundering boat, taking the bedraggled and forlorn survivors off the sinking vessel from almost certain death into a port and then sailing away on other duties and that the fact of sailing away makes the detention of the boat people unlawful. That is a very different circumstance to the one that Senator Harradine pointed to as an analogy. I believe it is in that peculiarity that the right of the Parliament to substitute its view as to appropriate compensation for that which would otherwise be awarded by a court is proper to the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, I do not think it is fair to characterise this provision of a limited quantum of damages or compensation that might be available to a person as a subterfuge or a way to avoid an implication under an international undertaking that Australia has entered into.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are trying to grapple with the `logic' of the High Court. That is the problem that this Parliament is confronting. One is confronting a situation which&mdash;and I repeat this; Senator Spindler may have been out of the chamber when I said it before&mdash;arises from an example given by Senator Coulter. Suppose that two vessels limped into port. One was riddled with some disease-bearing organism which threatened the integrity of human health in the Australian community or posed a real threat to the pastoral industry in north-west Western Australia, and therefore that boat was destroyed and burned at the order of the quarantine authorities. The other boat was not so infected and was allowed to tie up in port. If elements of the High Court's decision are correct, the persons who came in on the vessel that was burned would be entitled to have their detention subsequently characterised as unlawful and would be, if the Parliament did not act, entitled to compensation or damages determined by the court in some way which is unsupervised or uncontrolled by this Parliament, and the others would not.</PARA></TALK.START>

He was gaoled by the KMT, became a communist, went right through the system, was gaoled by the communists, and is a very well known author. I put that question to him. His clear response was that you do not believe what the PRC officials tell the outside world; you believe what they tell their own people. They told the outside world that nothing happened in Tiananmen Square; these are the same people who gave Mr Conybeare those assurances. Have Mr Conybeare or any of our officials been to the area where these people were returned?

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current mechanism for allowing some persons rejected for refugee status to stay in Australia on humanitarian grounds makes use of the Minister's powers under section 115.

The key point is that to access the Minister's powers, an entry permit review application must have been rejected. A refugee status review rejection does not trigger the Minister's section 115 powers.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to the issue you raised in the course of debate on the Migration Reform Bill 1992 on 10 December 1992 on the subject of access of the Cambodian boat people to humanitarian consideration. I am writing to confirm the position outlined by Senator Tate in response to your questions on the issue, namely that under the present Act and Regulations persons who make unauthorised entry to Australia do not have such access.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The procedures currently in place for allowing refugee applicants access to humanitarian consideration are complex. They rely on a power of the Minister to grant individuals an entry permit, in this case a domestic protection (temporary) entry permit, in spite of the fact that criteria for that permit may not have been met, in certain exceptional circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Migration Act provides that applicants are entitled to be granted an entry permit if they meet the criteria set out in regulations. Conversely, the Minister is specifically enjoined from granting an entry permit where the criteria are not met. There are only two circumstances where the Minister may grant an entry permit to an applicant who does not meet the regulatory criteria. This is when an application for a permit has been rejected either at internal review under section 115 of the Act or by the Immigration Review Tribunal under section 137 of the Act. In that case, the Minister may grant the permit if he or she considers it would be in the public interest to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current mechanism for allowing some persons rejected for refugee status to stay in Australia on humanitarian grounds makes use of the Minister's powers under section 115. In essence, the Minister grants applicants a domestic protection (temporary) entry permit in spite of the fact that they have been found not to meet an essential criterion for the permit, namely that they have been determined to be a refugee. The key point is that to access the Minister's powers, an entry permit review application must have been rejected. A refugee status review rejection does not trigger the Minister's section 115 powers. This reflects the fact that at the time section 115 was drafted, refugee status decisions were not formally incorporated in the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Cambodian boat people are designated persons held in custody under Division 4B of the Migration Act. Previously their status was that of prohibited entrants held under section 88 of the Act. No review rights attach to any entry permit or visa application made by a prohibited entrant or a designated person. As a result, the Minister's powers under section 115 or section 137 cannot be engaged in respect of any such application.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As applicants who have not entered Australia, in the strict legal sense in which the term entry is used in the Act, there are a limited number of visas and entry permits for which the Cambodians can be considered. It would seem that the only permit for which they might qualify is the domestic protection (temporary) entry permit. If the Cambodians are not found to be refugees it is likely that they will not meet the regulatory criteria for any entry permit or visa. If this proves to be the case, neither the Minister nor any officer of the Department will have the power to grant them an entry permit or visa under the law as it presently stands.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In your remarks to the Senate on this issue, you drew attention to the Report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations on Australia's Refugee and Humanitarian System, particularly paragraphs 5.4 and following. In those paragraphs, the Committee outlines its understanding of the operation of the present mechanism for granting humanitarian consideration. Although I cannot, of course, speak for the Committee, I think it would be fair to assume that the paragraphs in question were not intended to be a full and complete description of that mechanism. As it happens, the Committee has quite correctly set out the procedures which apply for the normal case. The Committee apparently did not feel it necessary for the purposes of its report to note that these procedures do not apply in all cases. As noted above, in the case of a designated person or a prohibited entrant, the Minister has no power to accede to a recommendation to grant an entry permit on humanitarian grounds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I hope that this letter helps to clarify the issues you have raised in relation to this complex and important issue.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In short&mdash;and I will be very short&mdash;it seems to me that there could well be circumstances where the Minister may consider, pursuant to his letter, that he has no power; that his hands are tied. There may be circumstances where he would say, `Yes, clearly there are strong humanitarian grounds and we should consider those grounds; we should not close the option up'. Under the present circumstances, pursuant to the letter that he has written to me, he does not have such power. I read the penultimate sentence of that letter:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>I believe that to be unduly restrictive, and I think any reasonable person would understand that. I am not necessarily talking about the people under current review, although I know that there have been appeals, including by the Australian Bishops Conference, for those people to be allowed entry on humanitarian grounds. But, in general terms, I believe that this measure deserves to be supported. It sets certain time limits. It is not a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kathleen Mavourneen</EMPHASIS>. It is not putting the thing on the long finger and stretching things out because, in respect of a person whose application for refugee status has been rejected, I have included the provisions that:</PARA>

<PARA>so he or she has to apply within 14 days&mdash;and:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)There are strong humanitarian grounds for the grant of a permanent entry permit to the person.</PARA>
<PARA>If those conditions are met, this enables&mdash;it is not a mandatory thing&mdash;the Minister to consider that and to grant a permanent entry permit, if the Minister so chooses. Also, the Minister must determine the application within 28 days of receiving it. I think it is perfectly reasonable and I appeal to the Committee to accede to this amendment. </PARA>

As I said, I do not regard the legislation as racist, but it is, arguably, discriminatory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To call arguments coloured or emotive may be a way of marginalising them. People are entitled to hold their different views. In my view, the policy underlying the legislation represents a discriminatory stance. Australia's migration intake is, in my view, biased against refugees. If people have money, connections and the ability to fill in forms, they are facilitated in access to this country. Senator Tate said earlier, as an example of our generosity, that we take 10,000 refugees. This legislation determines that we only take 10,000 refugees who are able to satisfy bureaucratic requirements. That makes it discriminatory because consideration is attached to a capacity to fill in forms and undergo entry requirements. The obvious example given by Senator Harradine was the ridiculous labelling of people from Cambodia as queue jumpers when there is no existing queue. </PARA>

That is precisely what, in a sense, Senator Harradine's amendment would achieve: that one would formally go through a refugee determination process, but in the end the pressure would be on the Minister to grant entry anyway.

<PARA>The arguments have been rehearsed pretty well, and I will not extend them. Nevertheless, this matter is fairly important. I am aware that Senator Watson proposes to move an amendment to this motion, and I imagine Senator Kernot will want to speak on it as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make a few points to make the Government's concern clear. Senator Watson's proposed amendment, which he has circulated and which, I accept, is a significant step forward from where we were with the first amendment that was sent back with which the House disagreed, solves two of the problems which I had. I recognise that; but it still causes two problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first and most obvious problem is revenue. It is very hard to be specific, but my personal estimate&mdash;it is not an official estimate&mdash;is that it may cost Consolidated Revenue about $10m. That means either that we have $10m less with which to provide public services, or that we have to get $10m from other taxpayers or increase the deficit by $10m; one of those three things. Each time we propose an amendment, thinking we are being generous to one group, we have to reflect on the fact that we are punishing someone else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The second problem is that it imposes an inequity. Let me give two examples. If the amendment proposed by Senator Watson is accepted, we get two absurdities. One is that the vice-chancellor of the University of Melbourne will be able to park tax free in the centre of Melbourne&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a comment about the tutor at the university who gets paid about the same as a low to middle range clerk in any private sector institution, so I will come back to that. The vice-chancellor of the university will be able to park tax free, but the person who comes to paint the building will not be able to do so. A clerk in the Public Service or private sector on one-tenth of the salary of the vice-chancellor who has free car parking back at headquarters, will not be able to. I do not blame the vice-chancellor for being concerned about that; what I cannot work out is why the Senate is concerned about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is the second ridiculous anomaly. Senator Kernot raised with me privately and then in her interjection the analogy of the university tutor. Let me put this to her: what she is proposing is that that university tutor will be able to drive into the university and park in the staff car park tax free; but the person who works in the bank on the university campus will not. People who work anywhere where they are not employees of the university will be doing exactly the same thing, but their tax situation will be different. I think Senator Kernot is creating absurd anomalies. We would very strongly suggest that it is not the most appropriate thing to do.

We do not dispute that amount. The Senate has to honour a commitment to the Budget in terms of this Bill of $90m. That $90m will be met and will be exceeded by quite a significant amount.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate may recall that when we examined the Budget Papers the figure for car parking was $120m. That was based on the premise of a start-up date in April. By the Government's own action, the deferral is to 1 July. Further, by the Government's own action in terms of the amendments that it made, initiated through this chamber, to the Fringe Benefits Assessment Bill, the grossing-up impact reduced the second year's take quite significantly. So by the Government's own action it has significantly reduced the revenue from car parking on two counts. </PARA>

There is the one kilometre discrimination. You can have one part of your factory within the one kilometre and another part of the factory just across the road or down the road outside the one kilometre&mdash;it is full of discrimination. Does not the Parliamentary Secretary have any concern or compassion for those struggling demonstrators in the physics labs and the chemistry labs who are working part time struggling to get an undergraduate degree or working for a postgraduate degree? He should think of not only the demonstrators but also the part time tutors. Senator McMullan might have been one himself.

He quite rightly said that ministers of religion in the pursuit of their pastoral duties are not subject to the same degree of fringe benefits tax as are others. But I ask the Parliamentary Secretary: what about the part time secretary who comes in five hours a day for one day a week who is going to get caught? The church will have to pay the fringe benefits car park tax. What about the church gardener who comes in and works six or seven hours mowing the lawns, and the cleaners who come in to do the cleaning up, who park behind the church and who are going to get caught by the fringe benefits? These are the people who the Parliamentary Secretary in the other place, in following his prescribed notes so closely, failed to acknowledge.

It is far easier to go to a fringe benefits Act, which is readily available, than a separate little Act called the Car Parking Act.

It means that if one is inside the line, one has to pay no matter what one's income is and no matter who one is. What Senator Watson is doing with this amendment is adding another inequity in that if a person happens to be in a certain occupation he will get an advantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just a matter of the chancellor or the vice-chancellor of a university. Many other people in these institutions on medium and upper medium level incomes and even low income earners may be affected. Other very low income earners in that kilometre range working in the private sector will also be affected and will have to pay. Once that boundary is defined, I think it is inequitable that a person who happens to be in the private sector has to pay but a person who is in the public sector or in a general charitable or religious area does not. </PARA>

So if one happens to be the head of a university research section that makes a profit as a commercial operation, under Senator Watson's amendment one will not have to pay a tax. However, a private enterprise research body down the road which, as a commercial undertaking, makes a profit, has to pay. This is where I think we run into the problem of creating an inequity in respect of low income earners and high income earners working within the same one kilometre.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point I want to make is that, in a practical way, many people in these institutions will get a real advantage.

It is almost in the centre of the central business district of Adelaide and has hundreds of car parking spots for staff. They will all be exempt. The university staff members will have the social advantage of being able to use that car park of a weekend and after hours for their social amenity of going shopping, going to entertainment and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a real advantage to be able to park one's car in the Adelaide University grounds, close to the central business district and all the entertainment areas of Adelaide.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can understand in a simple way that the amendment seems good.

For that reason, we believed that it was incumbent on the Government to so frame its Budget documents to make sure not that the top 10 tax experts in Australia understood what the Government meant but that the ordinary, reasonable man in Australia understood.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of our backtracking, there will be some harm and some hurt caused to at least one company that made a very passionate appeal to a number of senators and to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. In fact, I think that all those who were present at that meeting were very deeply moved by the comments that were made. Those comments led to the coalition framing its original amendment to ensure that there was no retrospectivity&mdash;that contracts validly made prior to Budget night would not get caught up retrospectively in the new legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on this side of the House have something of an abhorrence of retrospective legislation. It is retrospective legislation not of a kind which changes tax rates but which fundamentally alters the structure of the taxation that will apply to those particular payments. I remind the chamber that these particular payments, royalty withholding tax, were actually scrutinised quite openly by the Tax Office. Tax was paid on an assessment basis depending on where it went. In some cases there was an exemption, and assessments were made in relation to this withholding tax. Then along comes the Government on Budget night and changes the whole basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Effectively, where Australian companies are responsible for the tax, the rate is upped to 43 per cent gross&mdash;a very draconian rate. I understand why. It is trying to discourage certain payments that go off to places like Jersey or tax haven countries. But we have to be very wary in this country, in that in trying to eliminate tax avoidance many other genuine contracts go off to a lot of other countries around the world that are not necessarily tax haven countries&mdash;countries that have built up degrees of expertise. We require that expertise to be used and be developed here in Australia. It is generally the scientific area&mdash;the new technology&mdash;that we should be trying to promote and to encourage in Australia. I know there will always be people who will try to minimise tax arrangements. We believe it is right and proper to plug loopholes within the law which people are exploiting. But where contracts have been validly made we believe that they should expire before the new rules apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee will note that the Opposition has been particularly concerned that in the definition of contract no extension arrangements have been allowed. We are fairly tight on it. So I think our bona fides in the tax avoidance debate are quite clear. We are concerned with the retrospective effect&mdash;the impact it will have on industry and employment. There will be an impact on one company, but because it is retrospective to Budget night it will not wipe the company out entirely. True, it will have some severe financial ramifications, but we have to consider that good law is not made by hard cases or, putting it another way, bad law often results from hard cases. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a series of amendments by the Australian Democrats. I guess the one that I should start with is the one that I am most familiar with. The view of the Government is to not accept any of these amendments. The key points of the amendment moved by Senator Lees that deals with clause 6 and clause 6(3)(d), page 3, are that the administration of the rural adjustment scheme, RAS, is devolved to the State RAS authorities. The Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council is intended to provide oversighting at the strategic level by the Commonwealth and monitoring of the effectiveness of this scheme. It is therefore inappropriate to expand the size of the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council, which could lead to the perception of increased Commonwealth direction and upset the balanced relationships with the States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our view, the expertise sought by the expanded membership is well covered by the expertise criteria for membership outlined under clause 6(3) of the Bill. The membership will include members who specifically have expertise in rural counselling and banking. In addition, a membership of eight is considered to be the maximum for an effective working size, given the role and functions proposed for the Council. In our view, 12, including a chairperson, as proposed in the amendment, would be far too unwieldy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To some extent, the proposed amendment is factually incorrect. The rural counselling services are part of a joint Commonwealth-State program which is separate from the rural adjustment scheme. There are no State rural adjustment schemes in that sense.

It would confer a benefit on this group which other groups who do not have access to this sort of privilege would want as well. It is not appropriate to deal with these things in this manner. Rather than create this sort of unnecessary precedent, we believe the loan approach is a worthwhile way of encouraging good farm management and a worthwhile way of proceeding so that farmers can evaluate their risk and take some responsibility as well. We oppose the amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>These are very tightly drafted amendments and their intention is very clear. The intention is to implement Liberal policy, as best I understand it. These amendments retain but delay the loan component of the scheme so that the farm household support becomes at first a nine-month income tested welfare grant equivalent to JSA, which is not conditional on whether the farmer finally leaves or not. After nine months it then becomes a loan. I understand from my reading of what I can find of Liberal policy that this is what the Liberal Party basically would do if in government. While it is far from ideal as far as what the Democrats want, it is certainly a lot better than what the Government is offering. </PARA>

We listened to Senator Boswell on the night that we made our speeches in the second reading debate talking about droughts in other parts of the country. There are so many things that are well and truly out of the hands of our farmers. The Government's legislation that we are finally dealing with tonight will probably see some 20 per cent of family farms now in existence close to the point where those people presumably will simply join the unemployment queues in the city.

<PARA>These amendments give the option to the recipient when he or she wants payment of farm household support to start after a successful review of a decision either on the day of the new decision or eligibility can be backdated. If they choose backdating, as in the legislation now, they would get a lump sum payment. If they choose from the new decision, they would effectively have their time extended. This is because of the delays which, we are told, are up to 12 months in the Department of Social Security applications and appeals processes. That is despite the promises that have been made recently about efficiencies. So this is an important option. Otherwise, the grant period could effectively be over before the farmer knows whether he or she has actually qualified for farm household support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Natural Resources Management (Financial Assistance) Bill 1992 brings within one piece of legislation the authority for the Commonwealth to develop integrated approaches to land, water and associated vegetation management issues with community groups, the States and Territories and other organisations. At the moment much of the Commonwealth finance for landcare is channelled through the States and in many cases the States have used it to finance their previously State funded soil conservation offices. While the administration for water, land and related vegetation programs is through the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, the different legislation means programs are confusing and lack coordination. The Government circulated a discussion paper in April this year to key groups and the Government claims the comments supported a more integrated approach to natural resource management.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently the Federal Government obtained agreement from State governments to combine the Ministerial Councils of Agriculture, Water Resources and Soil Conservation to ensure that a more comprehensive focus to Federal and State policy discussion occurred in these areas. In the second reading speech of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) on the Natural Resources (Financial Assistance) Bill there were some positive aims. On the basis of these positive aims, the coalition is prepared to support the Bill and to monitor the progress of the consolidated arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first proposal in the Bill that the Minister refers to is his aim to combine the Ministerial Councils for Agriculture, Water Resources and Soil Conservation. The aim is to provide a more comprehensive or integrated approach to those related aspects of sustainable development in agriculture, which is certainly worth while. Part of the broad proposal is to merge the national soil conservation program and the Federal water resources assistance program into the one, and that is basically the content of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget for this year is to be $77m. We are talking here generally about what is commonly known to the ordinary person as landcare. There are really separate programs. There is a separate Landcare Ltd, a private company that is in a very positive way getting in the private sector or company finance to further promote the total soil conservation and landcare ethics. There are also the water programs that are concerned with salinity, high water tables et cetera. They have their own community groups separate from the landcare groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Community groups all have the aim of raising community awareness of soil, water and vegetation problems. They concentrate on community programs more than they do on particular problems on actual farms. That is where the major action actually has to occur&mdash;on the farms themselves. If these changes, or this consolidation of legislation, simplify the application procedures and reduce the administrative delays and costs, the change will be positive because there has been confusion and there have been complaints about this in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a further problem in the past where the finance from those two programs has gone via the States or through the State system and where the States themselves have been the recipients of the programs. The aim expressed in the Minister's second reading speech of the third element of this proposal, the partnership agreements&mdash;which is where the Minister can make comment if he feels that this is not right&mdash;is to hopefully overcome or reduce this weakness of States that do not maintain in real terms their expenditure in these areas prior to the Federal Government's assistance arrangements commencing. The States will be required to maintain in real terms their own expenditure at the same time, and this is sometimes the opposite part of the problem&mdash;not establishing too much duplication at the Federal level with regard to checking how the money is spent, applications and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Landcare, in broad terms, has been bipartisan, and continues to be bipartisan. But there have been times recently at particular functions when the original arrangement has not been maintained and there has not been recognition of the bipartisan approach. The shadow Minister for primary industry, the honourable member for Murray, Mr Bruce Lloyd, in his speech in the second reading debate in the House of Representatives, voiced his concern that the level of budgetary provision for landcare remains flat. In fact, it is declining in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With this comes another problem. If one looks at just the last three years of expenditure, at the expenditure estimated for a financial year as proposed in the Budget for that year, and the figures in the Budget documents for the following year which show what was actually spent, one sees that the figures are quite different. For example, in the year 1990-91 the Budget estimate was $88.5m; the actual spending, $73.5m. In 1991-92, the Budget estimate was $70.8m; the actual spending, $60.2m. In this year's Budget, for 1992-93, the Minister refers to $77m. I would hope that very close to $77m would be spent in this important area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one looks at the decade of Landcare and the figure for the national soil conservation section, of around $25m a year for each of those 10 years in real terms, one sees that the actual commitment is declining. We have to do better than that for the remaining years in the decade of Landcare. For a start, we have a number of Landcare groups&mdash;there are now many other types of groups as well as those referred to as Landcare groups.  In fact, there are over 1,300 of them. They have increased dramatically. Presumably, there will be further increases. While the money they want may not be able to be provided, there is obviously a continuing and growing commitment in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Separate to this, and additional to it, is the real problem of encouragement to farmers for on-farm remedial measures, which can be quite costly in some cases. This is where section 75D of the Income Tax Assessment Act has been quite important. In some locations in Australia, this Government has removed some of the tax incentives for on-farm works, for soil conservation, or for irrigation improvement. However, the write-off in the year of expenditure for lasering and related measures was never removed. This has been tremendously important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been some anomalies that have been subsequently sorted out concerning tree planting and fencing and some things that have been clarified and improved again in recent years. In some areas of Australia, farmers have spent up to $25m in some difficult years, and now close to 50 per cent of the total irrigation area of areas such as northern Victoria will be covered by these improvements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a tremendous achievement. That really is doing more to help in the slow but sure improvement in the quality of Murray River water from that part of the State, in the sense of drainage of irrigation water that goes into the Murray, than anything that has been done by communities through Landcare groups, SPAC groups, the salinity program action groups, or whatever we like to call them. They are tremendous groups; all of them. The real action is and always will have to be on the farms themselves. Any on-farm activities are very expensive. We are talking thousands of dollars for any worthwhile project. If there is a low cash flow, it is very difficult, even with section 75D tax deductibility, to write-off in the year of expenditure to provide any real incentive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a challenge here to provide incentives and encouragement for those on-farm practices so they may proceed to a greater degree than they have so far. The future of sustainable agriculture in these areas and, for that matter, in dry-land areas or wherever it may be in Australia, has to be addressed. In addition to the Landcare programs, and so forth, which provide community awareness, which do very good things and have to be maintained in real terms, additional policies or programs need to be put in place to ensure that more farmers are encouraged to do what they themselves would naturally want to do: that is, to improve the state of their farms so that every farmer who would want to, could leave the farm to the next generation, or sell it to whoever they wish in a better sustainable position than when they started. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I deviate slightly from this legislation to a related matter that has been drawn to my attention today. That is a press release by the Environment Centre, Northern Territory, which has been released by the campaign's coordinator, Mr Jamie Pittock, in which he blatantly attacks an outstanding company operating in the Northern Territory, Zapopan. Zapopan NL is a respected company which, in all dealings with government and environmental groups with regard to the Mount Todd gold mine, has used the correct process of approval of this project. This disgraceful press release has only been released today, but it includes some of the following statements by Mr Pittock with regard to the draft environmental impact statement conducted for the Mount Todd gold mine:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Supplement is a cynical exercise in deceiving the public into believing the endangered Gouldian finch will be adequately conserved. All Zapopan has proposed is to cut most of the finch monitoring program at Mount Todd (200 person day per year of 360) and give the money saved to the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service (ANPWS), who are currently assessing the mine proposal, for a national recovery program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Government should be ashamed of entertaining Zapopan's latest proposal. The message it gives to developers who threaten endangered species is that they can buy their way out by giving money to the ANPWS. This is particularly disturbing since ANPWS as recently as May 1992 claimed the first step to conserving the bird involves `full protection to large breeding colonies'. Sacrificing the largest known colony of finches at Mount Todd is no way to conserve the species.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Pittock goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While we welcome ANPWS's establishment of a finch recovery plan it is only part of a solution that would conserve the finch and allow the mine to proceed. Zapopan's plan offers the finch next to nothing, no reserves for breeding areas and an inadequate monitoring program.</PARA>
<PARA>Further on in Mr Pittock's attack on this very respectable company, he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Zapopan have effectively and deceptively unloaded responsibility for protecting the finch. A new monitoring program is proposed that is so weak that timely detection of any significant impact is virtually impossible. While we criticised the previous monitoring proposal the issue was Zapopan's lack of will to properly implement the CSIRO monitoring plan by collecting sufficient pre-mining data and by defining a `significant impact', not the plan itself which is sound.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We note that Zapopan has not repeated many of its unsubstantiated and misleading statements, such as claims in the DEIS that only 1% of the breeding area and 0.2% of the nests of the endangered Gouldian finch would be destroyed. While this vindicates our previous criticism this is of little comfort if the Commonwealth Government fails to act in the interest of the finch.</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Zapopan has not answered the serious scientific criticism levelled at the DEIS by the World Wide Fund for Nature, Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union, Australian Conservation Foundation and the Centre.</PARA>
<PARA>This press release is nothing less than appalling. Zapopan has designed the Mount Todd project to ensure that the Gouldian finch population in the Yinberrie Hills is protected to the maximum extent practicable. In fact, in a company profile of Zapopan, since 1986 approximately $1.5m has been spent by various organisations on research and investigation into the Gouldian finch; 33 per cent of this has come from Zapopan. I am pleased to note that the Northern Territory Government has been another major contributor with 64 per cent of the $1 1/2m going to research on the finch. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The project design features described in the draft environmental impact statement, October 1992, represent substantial modifications to initial planning and design concepts with the objective of pre-empting or mitigating effects on the Gouldian finch. They include three points. All but one component have been relocated to alternative sites outside the Yinberrie Hills. The exception is the main pit,  which cannot be relocated. Features that will prevent or discourage access to solutions containing concentrations of cyanide that could be toxic to wildlife have been incorporated into the design. Specific measures and safeguards will be implemented to enhance and protect the breeding habitat in the Yinberrie. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The draft environmental impact statement concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that mining activity is unlikely to pose long-term threat to the viability of the Gouldian Finch in the Yinberrie Hills.</PARA>
<PARA>Further on, it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of far greater concern are factors such as the habitat impact of land-use practises across the species' range and the prevalence of air-sac mites, either or both of which may have contributed to the decline in the wold of the Gouldian Finch.</PARA>
<PARA>I am afraid the scare campaign undertaken by the Environment Centre, Northern Territory, deserves everything it gets if Zapopan considers taking further action and prosecutes the Centre for such defamatory statements on this most sensitive issue, on which Zapopan should be commended for the way in which it has listened to all concerned interest groups on the mining proposal at Mount Todd in the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst that issue is certainly parochial and a matter of concern to the Northern Territory, it is opportune and proper to state it. Some of the aspects of this Bill appear to be positive and, hopefully, will be positive with regard to the future of the program. The coalition will be supporting the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Democrats support the thrust of the Natural Resources Management (Financial Assistance) Bill, which is to develop and implement an integrated approach to natural resource management based on ecologically sustainable development. We recognise that the aim of the Bill is to facilitate efficient, equitable and sustainable management of Australia's natural resources. We also recognise that the Bill has the support of such groups as Greening Australia, the Australian Conservation Council and the National Farmers Federation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In brief, we agree with the description that has been given by Senator Tambling of the purposes of the Bill. We applaud the fact that it establishes arrangements for the financial assistance between the Commonwealth and the States specifically for natural resource management projects. The way it goes about this in terms of legislative replacements and making the National Water Resources (Financial Assistance) Act and the Soil Conservation (Financial Assistance) Act redundant is recognised as well. The fact that about 1,400 Landcare groups will be funded through this mechanism provides a slightly more efficient and a less circuitous method of funding. That is also to be applauded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will refer later to the structure of the committee which is to be established through this Bill, the National Landcare Advisory Committee, to provide advice on the priorities and strategies for natural resource management programs. But the fact that a committee is being established is also recognised as important. To have that committee with a non-government majority is also important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We think that the strengths of the Bill are that the integrated management of land, water and vegetation is encouraged and that there is an introduction&mdash;that is an important word in this context&mdash;of the principles of ecologically sustainable development as a context for the development and implementation of natural resources management in Australia. The value of a community oriented approach to natural resources management is recognised by this Bill. But, for all those strengths, it is particularly noticeable that this Bill does not provide for a definition of `ecological sustainable development'&mdash;and that is a significant weakness. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The composition of the National Landcare Advisory Committee is also questioned by us. We congratulate the Government for the reforms that it is undertaking in this area of resource management and the integration of the financial arrangements. But we think it is important to support the whole systems approach to natural resources management and to recognise the conservation of a biodiversity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The soil productivity and water quality of Australia are matters which have received considerable press recently. If this is a means by which we can maintain those ecological processes, then I hope that it has the capacity to deliver. Perhaps I will refer to that a little later. It is good to see that we have the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) working together, even if only in a tentative manner here, to develop a more integrated approach to natural resources management. This Bill can only be one part of the new approach but, as I have said, even if it is tentative, it is to be recognised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we need and what I understand is being developed is a whole new program framework which includes land, water and vegetation and the national landcare program. The discussion paper on the national landcare program, which was produced in April 1992, proposed that a single natural resources advisory committee be established to guide the Commonwealth on community attitudes to natural resource issues, issues of national significance and priorities for action. The paper stated that the membership of the committee would comprise parties affected by the outcomes of natural resource management policies and programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Comments were received on that paper from, amongst other groups, Greening Australia, the Australian Conservation Foundation and the National Farmers Federation. Amongst other things, those groups made three recommendations about the advisory committee. The Government has here accepted two of those: that the advisory committee should include a majority of community representatives and that it should be chaired by a person from the non-government sector. However, a third point was not accepted and that was that the community sector should be given the right to appoint community positions to the advisory committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I foreshadow a Democrat amendment, which I will be moving in the committee stage, which addresses that problem. The reason that amendment is necessary is that it is so important that the community itself be recognised for its capacity to understand what is involved here. That has been demonstrated, as has been mentioned by Senator Tambling, by those hard working, well informed and expert practitioners of landcare who are the community&mdash;not the bureaucrats, not the academics and not the people who are removed from the actual practice of landcare. We strongly believe that the community sector should have the right to choose who represents them. The community, rather than the bureaucracy and the Minister, is more in touch with those who can best represent them on such an advisory committee. The expertise, experience and the established networks that we see operating in such groups as Greening Australia should be recognised and strongly supported. The process which we have here I do not think pays sufficient regard to those qualities I have just mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other problem we have with this Bill is that it lacks a definition of `ecologically sustainable development' which can be followed through. The problem with this is that we end up with a situation where, unless that concept is defined, we have further decisions made and subsequent actions taken either by the Commonwealth or by State governments which are able to choose their own definition and are able to provide qualifications to what is ecologically sustainable development. A recent decision by the newly formed Council of Australian Governments was to endorse ESD, without defining it, and greenhouse strategies subject to budgetary constraints and priorities. Such a qualification by the States and Territories makes the whole commitment a non-commitment, an absolute nonsense. The conduct of the business in the States and Territories can be business as usual. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The biophysical constraints of those States and Territories have been ignored; they are being exceeded in many cases. We cannot sustain such a practice of conducting our affairs. There will always be economic constraints operating in the economy. That is what it is about; that is what it is; that is what it means. To use that as a caveat of recognition for ESD is so faulty it is ridiculous. The constraints are not temporary. Action to implement the ESD recommendations needs to occur now. Action cannot be delayed any longer. We have to demonstrate fully and clearly the axiomatic statement. I am sure Senator O'Chee would be interested in this as he is terribly interested in axiomatic statements; here is one for him to stick away in his little book. The governments of Australia do not recognise that unless ecology is sustained there cannot be an economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have foreshadowed amendments to be made in the committee stage. They are amendments which do not detract from the thrust of the Bill and support rather than militate against the Minister's reforms in the agricultural sector. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is important at the outset to state that this Bill is integral to the overall approach to facilitating an ecologically sustainable agricultural industry in Australia. The Natural Resources Management (Financial Assistance) Bill, whilst undoubtedly a move in the right direction, has some shortcomings which require attention. The very definition of ecological sustainability is crucial in this regard, as Senator Bell has already mentioned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the context of an agricultural system, the major determinants for ecological sustainability, according to Dr John Cameron and Jane Elix from the Australian Conservation Foundation, are dependent on the system generating its own nutrients; having a high degree of species diversity; having high comparative energy efficiency; not being dependent upon fossil fuel energy sources; having internal mechanisms for control of pests and weeds; and being resilient, meaning it can return to its original productivity after a major external shock or a period of stress. Whilst these criteria are not always able to be met they are, nonetheless, an ideal that we should work to achieve. Unfortunately, this approach is not accepted in some circles where a more short term, economically based approach is favoured. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is this difference in approach to ecologically sustainable development that points to the shortcoming in the drafting of the legislation. The Bill states that one of its objects is to facilitate natural resources management in Australia `consistent with the principles of ecologically sustainable development'. The phrase `ecologically sustainable development' is, however, not defined in the Bill and this could lead to either misunderstanding or manipulation by vested interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In most other respects, the Natural Resources Management Bill appears to be a positive step towards better management of our natural resources. In particular, it is pleasing to see at last that a more integrated and holistic approach is being adopted in government policy. We cannot continue to follow the reductionist approach that has dominated government policy making to date, in which the interconnectedness of ecological systems has been neglected or ignored. This approach should be reflected in all government legislation that relates to the environment in which we live because, after all, the environment represents our own life support system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is however a long way to go before we can truly claim to be on the path to sustainability. As Professor William Rees from the University of British Columbia in Canada stated in an article entitled `The Ecology of Sustainable Development':</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most discussion of sustainable development in the socio-political mainstream emphasises the need to sustain economic growth and assumes that we can `account for' the environment through greater efficiency of resource use, improved technology, better pollution control and wider use of environmental assessment. Such incrementalism may constitute a necessary first step but by itself would result in little more than a somewhat better dressed version of the growth-bound status quo, requiring a minimum of adjustment to either industry or individuals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The evidence suggests, however, that we may be fast approaching absolute limits to material economic growth. We no longer have the luxury of `trading off' ecological damage for economic benefits if we hope to have a sustainable future. The maintenance of global ecological integrity necessarily becomes our highest priority and must be taken into account in every local and regional development decision.</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, from a personal perspective, it was invaluable for me to attend the Winning back the West conference in Fitzroy Crossing earlier this year. The conference initially examined the history of the pastoral industry in the Kimberleys and the devastating impact that that free ranging cattle grazing often had on the ecology of the region. We were then informed about the many initiatives in the area to minimise the impact of cattle grazing on the rivers and land. In the context of this Bill, it is important to note that the role of the local Landcare groups has been crucial in these developments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was also interesting to note at this conference that the local Aboriginal population is also contributing to these efforts, and this collaboration is perhaps beginning to assist in developing some common sense of care for the land that we all share. The sentiments expressed by Pat Dodson, from the National Reconciliation Council, and local Aboriginal representatives, during a wonderful meeting on the banks of a dry river bed on Louisa Downs Station were both inspirational and consistent with this belief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The potential for different groups working together and having Aboriginal representation on the advisory committee is also exciting. As I said at the outset, I believe that this Bill, in establishing the National Landcare Advisory Committee and providing arrangements for financial assistance to the States for natural resources management projects, is a step in a positive direction. The Democrats amendments are further helpful additions because of the spelling out of ecologically sustainable development principles and improving experienced community representation on the advisory committee. I indicate my support for the Democrat amendments and for this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA>I will not waste the time of the Committee by reading the details of the amendments. I will describe briefly their purpose. We have, over some considerable time, been informed about the Government's development of and interest in the national strategy for ecologically sustainable development. We have been presented with any number of opinions about this, and we have, during that process, heard a number of people attempting to define ESD. We have received, as a result of the considerable amount of time spent on it, the statement of Australia's goal, objectives and guiding principles for the ESD strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without listing the goal, the core objectives or the guiding principles in order, I would just like to remind the Senate of what the goal has been stated to be. It is: development that improves the total quality of life, both now and in the future, in a way that maintains the ecological processes on which life depends. To meet that goal, one of the changes to government institutions and machinery which has been recognised by this Government is a commitment. Quite blatantly, in black and white, that commitment states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Government will:</PARA>

<PARA>Here it is&mdash;the Natural Resources Management (Financial Assistance) Bill 1992. The opportunity is here, so let us see it being incorporated. It is provided by the generosity of the Australian Democrats. It remains within the capacity of the Government to accept that and to recognise that here is the opportunity to deliver on that promise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other part of our amendments is quite simply a matter of recognising the need, as I indicated in my contribution to the second reading debate, to ensure that the advisory committee which is to be constituted under this legislation actually takes account of the experience which exists in the community and elects to that committee people with sufficient experience in or knowledge of natural resources management including conservation, vegetation management, environment protection and community organisations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At 2.20 in the morning we are faced again with further latter day amendments from the Australian Democrats. My office first saw anything relating to amendments to these Bills from the Democrats in a draft form at about midday today and of course the final amendment was put on our table, I think, 10 or 15 minutes ago as it was distributed. In the package that we are looking at there are essentially two substantive amendments from the Democrats: one which talks about a definitional area, in the area of sustainable development; and the second relating to the size of an advisory committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, the way in which Democrat policy is developed at the late stages and approaches are made on this could only be described as verbal diarrhoea. By the time one finished reading the definitions put forward in clause 4 for the principles of ecologically sustainable development that the Democrats are proposing, one would probably have died of old age and certainly nothing would have happened to any of the projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I highlighted in my speech during the second reading debate my concern at the process of review that had taken place with regard to Zapopan's development and the frustrations that are being caused there in that particular project. Similarly, I think the principles of ecologically sustainable development that have now been put forward as an amendment to clause 4 would give us cause for concern about the viability and the future of any significant and major projects. I am sure all senators will take particular interest in the proposals and the policies of the coalition with regard to the fast tracking procedures for appropriate developments in Australia which create jobs and create wealth and, at the same time, protect the special environment and Aboriginal interests that have to be preserved in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we need to see in legislation is a recognition of those appropriate areas of environmental and Aboriginal interests as have recently been demonstrated by the Federal Government and the Northern Territory Government in the fast tracking of the Mount Todd proposal in the Northern Territory, and also the development of the MacArthur River project by Mt Isa Mines. I would certainly commend the work that Mr Brereton and the Northern Territory Ministers have invested in ensuring that those projects get up and going. If we were to accept this type of amendment, we would certainly be bogged down and would not be able to get on with that sort of project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will not be supporting the Democrat amendment to clause 14 concerning the National Landcare Advisory Committee as we believe that a committee of 12 will already have wide representation. It is unnecessary for a committee of 12 to be restricted, as the Democrats are now proposing, to three of its members having experience or special knowledge of conservation, vegetation management, environment protection and community organisation. Talk about jobs for the boys! Very obviously, the Australian Democrats are looking to stack committees by ensuring that the membership of these committees is increased and after their particular and special interests. The coalition will not be supporting these amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government will not be supporting the Democrat amendments either, but the office of the Minister has furnished me with these statements that I can make with respect to the two material amendments before the Chair. An authorised comment from the Minister, Mr Crean, states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are committed to incorporating into this and other relevant portfolio legislation a more specific reference to the core objectives and agreed principles of ecological sustainable development as agreed by the governments in a national strategy for ESD at the recent council of Australian governments meeting at the earliest opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA>With respect to the second amendment, the Government of course again does not support these proposed changes. But I can say that the legislation reflects the Government's balanced approach and therefore no particular interests will be given prominence in the membership of the National Landcare Advisory Committee. As Minister Crean stated in his second reading speech, non-government representatives, including the Chairperson, will form the majority of the Committee's membership. These will be well qualified individuals from a broad range of backgrounds. With those comments on the record, I indicate the Government's opposition to these amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I indicated earlier, I will be supporting the Democrats' amendments if they choose to call a division on it. I must say that the comments I have just heard from the Opposition and the Government cause me some genuine alarm, because I would have thought that the Democrats' amendments were eminently sensible for inclusion in this Bill. I believe that it is shoddy and slapdash to leave out such important concepts as definitions of the ESD process and the specification that, within a committee which is addressing these concepts, there should be some relevant experience.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think I was not necessarily expecting the Opposition to support the amendments, but I feel that refusal to accept the very reasonable amendments put forward by the Democrats actually calls into question the genuine motivation of both the Government and the Opposition with regard to this Bill. It makes me want to vote against the Bill, which would, I realise, be a token gesture. I will maintain my support of it, but I do condemn the Government strongly for failing to include these components within the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the statement by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Crean, given to us by the Minister representing him. I must address the typical criticism that has been delivered by Senator Tambling. The normal response we have received to anything that has not been given several weeks worth of consideration has been that it has all been a bit fast for the thinkers opposite. I must say that the principles of ecologically sustainable development which we have listed here are in concert with the principles contained in the Brundtland report. Senator Tambling should, if he were interested in these sorts of things, have had that particular document on his bookshelf for at least three years. If these principles are a revelation to him today, then I am only sorry that he has revealed that by showing that he has not had the time to appreciate and understand it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought that there has been plenty of notice for those who are interested in these principles to have absorbed and reached a conclusion about their appropriateness to be included in legislation. I was ready to accept the reasons for not going along with the second phase of our amendments&mdash;that which considered the numbers on the Committee. I thought that that was fair enough; there was a reason for that. I thought the sting in the tail of Senator Tambling's reasons was gratuitous and really not worthy of this place; I was happy to accept the reasons but I thought the insult was useless. Again, I welcome the statement by the Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One is never surprised when the members of the Opposition get up and speak on things like ESD; they reveal that they have very little knowledge and care less about things environmental. As my colleague Senator Bell has pointed out, since the Brundtland report the concepts of ESD have been well rehearsed. After much prodding, the Government itself set up nine committees which looked at ESD and made many hundreds of recommendations. That was some 13 months ago. The Government is yet to take up any of those recommendations so it has not shown any great willingness to process this. The Minister is now turning around and saying that the Government will insert these principles at the earliest opportunity; I say, `Here is the first and earliest opportunity', and yet it is not prepared to do it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find that quite remarkable. I think it indicates that still, at this stage, neither the Government nor the Opposition has any understanding or any serious commitment to ESD. They are really playing with it; they have taken up the words. Just today we have seen the Opposition release its concept of ESD. It is going to set up a department and, exactly as Senator Tambling said, it will be a department of fast track development. The idea of ecological has been dropped entirely from the concept; it is sustainable development. The Opposition does not yet know that development is not going to be sustainable if it does not look after the environment. So there is still a shock in store for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of us have already understood that; we are trying to teach that lesson to a few others but they are still to learn it&mdash;very unfortunately, and very unfortunately for this country. If Senator Tambling were to go back and review the history of EISs, for instance, he would find that, with those EISs that have been most thoroughly carried out, with those EISs where the public has been most thoroughly involved and the longest time has been involved, those projects that have then eventuated at the end of that process have done the least environmental damage, have gone forward to the greatest profitability and have been the most successful projects. Fast tracking, really, is a recipe for imminent disaster. If the Opposition is going to fast track everything it is really going to rip this country apart. That is a lesson that is already there in the record if its members choose to look at it, but it is a lesson that they are not choosing to learn, or even to look at at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we will divide on this, Mr Chairman; it is a very important principle. It is the first opportunity that the Government has had to incorporate this into legislation; it is choosing not to and that is a very sad reflection but it is not an unsurprising reflection. On Monday, when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) releases his environment statement, I will be very surprised if there is any strong emphasis on ESD. If there is, I will be there pointing out to the Prime Minister how hollow his words are. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The National Residue Survey Administration Bill 1992 and cognate Bills are to allow the Government to recover 100 per cent of the Government's cost of undertaking the national residue survey from July next year, instead of the current 60 per cent. This survey is conducted by the Government to determine the chemical status of Australian food. Until a few years ago, the Government paid the $6m annual cost as a public health measure. This changed to 50 : 50, and then to 40 : 60. Now complete cost recovery is required, all of it from primary industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague the honourable member for Murray, and shadow Minister for primary industry, Mr Bruce Lloyd, pointed out in his speech during the second reading debate in the House of Representatives that he was unaware of any other country in the world where producers are required to pay in full, as this Bill requires, for a public health facility. In the industry there are 25 separate items on the schedule encompassing 17 levy Bills. This shows the spread of levy throughout agriculture. The survey analyses samples of Australian produced animal and plant food products, particularly meat, for residues of a wide range of contaminants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those in the agricultural industry are generally fed up with this Labor Government because of the number of charges that have been imposed on the industry. The industry is being pushed to promote the pure food status of Australian food products, which is worth promoting, but when it comes to any form of government assistance to the industry, another tax is slapped on them. The Government could not even assist the industry to the tune of half of the $6m per annum required for the public health facility&mdash;a mere $3m a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These Bills are to allow the Government to recover 100 per cent of the Government's cost of undertaking the national residue survey from July next year, instead of the current 60 per cent. The Cattle Council, which represents the major levy payers, has objected to this increase because it believes that, while it does benefit from survey in the marketplace, the major reason for the survey is public health. Other levy payers have also objected. To the rural industry this Bill is seen as being symbolic of the Labor Government's attitude of unfairly transferring public costs to farmers, imposing user pays with no accountability as to the efficiency of the program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Residue Survey Administration Bill 1992 provides for a trust account to be established which will allow funds and obligations to be carried over beyond the end of the financial year. Provision is also made for other contributions to be received from industries. This will give industry more flexibility in the way its costs are paid if it does not want a levy. Industries will have the power to pull out of the survey, or alternatively, have more products included. The Minister cannot include products unless satisfied that the industry wants them included. By increasing its cost recovery from 60 to 100 per cent, the Commonwealth expects to save about $2.7m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As these are Budget Bills, the coalition parties will not be opposing them. However, as Mr Lloyd has already said in his speech during the second reading debate, on being elected to government, the coalition will amend this legislation and return to 50 per cent cost recovery. The coalition believes that is a reasonable apportionment of the public health situation versus the industry. We would, of course, make the appropriate Budget adjustments that would be necessary to implement any such amendment and change in the future. There are 18 of these primary industry Bills in total and I would hope that it is possible to consolidate some of them in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This will be an issue during the election campaign. The Opposition will be saying to industry that it recognises that government, as well as industry, has a responsibility; that when it comes to encouragement for promotion overseas, and reassurance at home, of the pure food status of our products, a coalition government is prepared to give some practical and pragmatic recognition and assistance. That will certainly be on the agenda for the forthcoming election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats support the National Residue Survey Administration Bill to the extent that it sets up a trust account from which to pay the costs of the national residue survey. The Democrats wholeheartedly support the residue survey run by the Bureau of Resource Sciences, but we agree with many of the criticisms that have been made of that survey.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many argue that export produce is still predominant in the survey at the expense of domestic produce, particularly fruit and vegetables, although agricultural chemicals are widely used in their production. The Australian Science and Technology Council, for example, has said the survey should be expanded to provide a broad based monitoring program for all agricultural produce. Some argue that the range of chemicals tested is too narrow. The Science and Technology Council has stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The areas of deficiency are in analyses for antibiotics, anti-helminthics and hormones in meat and for fruit and vegetable and minor crops in general, grains and imported food.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another concern is the adequacy of procedures to enable the identification of the source of excessive chemical residues. The National Farmers Federation stated to the Senate Select Committee on Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals in Australia:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effectiveness of the NRS as a monitor and a means of preventing excessive residues is dependent on the ability to trace the products tested back to their source. NFF urges the introduction of procedures which will permit residues detected in NRS to be traced back to source and for the NRS to be directed more towards locating residue levels in excess of NRLs.</PARA>
<PARA>Another criticism was that the survey did not include imported food but a recent Bill has corrected this. All of these concerns have been accepted by the Senate Select Committee on Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other criticism, and one shared by the Democrats, concerns funding arrangements. A widely shared view is that the survey should be funded by a levy on chemical sales instead of a levy on food producers. Both the Australian Science and Technology Council and the Senate Committee have suggested a monitoring levy on the chemical producing industry itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It goes without saying, I think, from the consistent stance that we have taken in this area, that the Democrats would much prefer that we did not need to monitor our produce for chemical residues at all, because we should reach the situation where no harmful chemicals are being used in their production. To be practical, though, we recognise that, although we do not stand alone in holding this view, it is widely believed that we must throw chemicals around all over the place in order to maintain our agricultural and horticultural industries. Using chemicals in agriculture has become a billion dollar industry with in-built incentives. The in-built incentives maintain vested interests and ensure that there is a continued drive towards expansion of this industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill will do nothing to contain that expansion. It will fund the survey and it is flexible enough to expand as the need to monitor the chemicals in our food expands. That will not attack the fundamental problem, which is the attitude which encourages our growing dependence on chemicals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposals here place a levy on producers, whether or not they use chemicals. If we are to have the principles of cost recovery and user pays, we should do it properly. The funds for this survey should come from the sale of chemicals. There is then an economic incentive to limit their use. That is our fundamental objection to the Bill, not just the principle of cost recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I foreshadow that I will be moving an amendment in the committee stage which, if passed, would enable the Minister to come back next year with a proposal that rightly places the cost burden on the chemical industry itself. I also foreshadow that that amendment would have the effect of inviting the coalition actually to vote for the policy enunciated by Senator Tambling. I have suggested in this case that the excuse that he has not seen it before cannot be applied. It is in fact the policy of the coalition. The shadow Minister's speech during the second reading debate in the other place made mention of the fact that in no other country in the world, to his knowledge, are producers required to pay 100 per cent of the cost of such a survey. That is a comment I would endorse and which I would agree is a situation which should be recognised by those who propose that our producers meet 100 per cent of the cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also agree with much of the rest of what was contained in Senator Tambling's speech about the necessity to recognise that such costs placed on our producers are not equitable and do not recognise that there is a community health benefit from surveying and understanding what is in our foods; and in fact the Government has an obligation to reduce the amount of tax imposition on our primary producers. I recognise those things and because I recognise them I foreshadow that I will be moving an amendment to meet the concerns expressed on behalf of the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not share the view that because something is a Budget Bill it is sacrosanct and cannot be touched; there certainly can be a request made. Perhaps it should be realised that that particular excuse has, on occasions, been ignored by those in the coalition when it suits them. I will eagerly await the committee stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank all honourable senators for their responses. I will be brief in responding to a couple of points that were made. One concerned which other countries might be on full cost recovery; my advice is that New Zealand and the United Kingdom both have full cost recovery in place for their national residue monitoring programs, and the move to full cost recovery for the national residue survey is consistent with current Government policy on user pays in Australia. It is, in that respect, part of the overall micro-economic reform package.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the point that Senator Bell was making, that the chemical industry has not been asked to contribute to the cost of the national residue survey, that is because it already contributes substantially to the cost of establishing residue limits, and the occurrence of residues above those limits is, of course, frequently due to misuse of chemicals. The other reason is that large parts of the survey are for residual chemicals no longer produced by the industry, or from natural resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other comment I should make concerns the survey itself, which is about adding value to Australian produce not covered by other surveys. It is a trade based survey; it is not about nutritional habits. The Australian market basket survey, which is conducted by the National Food Authority, is to estimate the dietary intakes of chemical contaminants by Australians. That survey is based on a small sample size of processed and raw food available in supermarkets. The food is prepared to table ready form before analysis and foods included in that survey are not necessarily of Australian origin. With those comments in relation to some of the points raised by the speakers in this debate, I commend the Bills to the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to get some information concerning the table in the schedule to the Bill as mentioned in clause 4, on how the suggested operative rates have been put together. I refer particularly to potatoes. Information that I have received from the Department says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The potatoes rate was calculated allowing a potato program costing $52,000 and a domestic production level for 1990-91 of 1 180 000 tonnes.</PARA>
<PARA>On a cost of that nature, I find it completely incongruous to have what is probably the most similar vegetable possible&mdash;the onion&mdash;listed at $1.56 a tonne. If that figure does not contain a misplaced decimal point, and a few other things as well&mdash;and I trust that it does&mdash;I would like the Minister to bear in mind that, at $1.56 a tonne, that is probably all the profit there is in exporting onions. There is no way in the world that we can have an industry that is being run just to fund a residue survey. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When honey is 0.12c a kilo and onions are $1.56 a tonne and potatoes are 4.5c a tonne, there is clearly a mistake of some sort.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In response to your queries yesterday on the National Residue Survey Bills arising from the Opposition questions asked of the Minister's Office, I offer the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Operative rate levy figures found in column 2 of the schedule of the National Residue Survey Administration Bill are estimated from current Survey program costs divided by the amount of production (or export) from statistics. Column 3 of the schedule sets a maximum levy rate based on a level generally 2 or 3 times the Operative rate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The onions rate was calculated allowing an onion program costing $85 000 and an export tonnage of 54 578 tonnes in 1990-91 (the 1991-92 export figures now available indicate nearly 75 000 tonnes which would mean about $1 levy on the same cost base). The potatoes rate was calculated allowing a potato program costing $52 000 and a domestic production level for 1990-91 of 1 180 000 tonnes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These figures in column 2 show the size of the levy but the actual levies to be imposed are intended to be set by regulation after industry consultation before they come into effect, as is the normal practice. Clause 9(2)(b) of the same Bill makes a levy set by regulation to be the one that prevails.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The levies to be set by regulation will mostly be lower than indicated in column 2. Those industries either not participating in the survey or funding it through other means will have the levy set at 0.00 cents. Other levies will be lower than indicated because of reductions in Survey costs. For example, the move of analytical testing to open competition and away from exclusive use of Aust. Govt. Analytical Laboratories is expected to significantly reduce survey costs. Likewise, so will a reduction in the annual number of samples analysed for some commodities.</PARA>

The method of calculation for it is the same as the method of calculation for the other figures in the schedule; that is, there has been an estimate of the projected costs of the survey and that is one element of the calculation. The other element of the calculation is the production of the particular commodity. The objective of the calculation of the formula is to make sure there is no cross-subsidising between the various categories of commodity that are mentioned here so that we have a fair cost per commodity.

That comes to a unit cost per tonne of 156c. For potatoes, the proposed total cost of the survey is $52,500 and the production in tonnes for 1990-91 is 1,180,000, which brings a unit cost per tonne of 4.5c. It is clear how the figures come out. For potatoes, the total cost for the survey is $52,500; for onions it is $85,300. The production of onions is 54,500 tonnes; for potatoes it is 1,180,000 tonnes.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Temporary Chairman, if that is the best explanation that can be given, should we move an amendment? It is ridiculous to pass a measure which could absolutely wreck an industry. The amount of $1.56 a tonne is more than every onion exporter in Tasmania made for the whole of last year's export crop. They did not make $1.56 a tonne. Are we going to lumber them with something that will ensure that there is no export industry, or are we going to get this costing down to something like what is reasonable for others? We are talking about 25c a tonne for apples, pears and citrus fruits; we are talking about 4.5c for potatoes. Why are we talking about $1.56 a tonne for onions? It is nonsense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to be a party to trying to wreck the industry because of some stupidity that is perpetrated in this legislation. It is just not good enough. It is said that one thing needs to be done because it is for the export market and the other thing needs to be done because it is for the domestic market. Let us be consistent about it and say, `Does it matter whether it is done for export, does it matter whether it is done domestically?'. Let us come up with something that is reasonable. At $1.56 a tonne one could test damned nearly every onion&mdash;it is just crazy. At best, one probably only needs an onion tested for every export truckload&mdash;every 20 tonne container or something. I have grown onions for export. If one has an onion crop of, say, 50 acres, one does not need to test every onion if one has treated them all the same way. If they are being grown in a district and they are all treated in the same manner, every onion does not need to be tested. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that onions are grown for export in Western Australia, South Australia, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and Queensland, but they are all grown on much the same basis.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Temporary Chairman, can I propose to the Minister that it is very obvious, in light of the issue that Senator Archer has raised and has identified, that it would be desirable for there to be an amendment. That amendment could be either to delete the reference and the line relating to onions from the schedule or, alternatively, it would probably be appropriate for me to move an amendment to the schedule to change the item appearing against onions, that is, the $1.56 and the $5 items and substitute them with a more appropriate figure that would be consistent with the rules of mathematics that have been applied across the rest of the proposal. I invite the Minister to respond. I believe Senator Archer would probably also be attracted to either of those amendments&mdash;either dropping the onions or amending the onions.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With the greatest of respect, I think Senator Archer has had his questions answered in full. I am advised that this Act contains a provision that these levy rates can, in the end, be fixed by regulation and, of course, those regulations would lay on the table in this chamber for allowance or otherwise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also advised that it is the intention of the Minister that there be consultation. The note I have here is that the National Residue Survey Bills do not actually set any level of cost recovery, except implied by the operative rates in the schedule which will be reviewed and reset by regulation after consultation with the industry. So the figures we are talking about are the implied operative rates set out in the schedule and those rates will be reviewed and reset by regulation after the industry has been consulted at length. The Bills, however, provide mechanisms for more equitable means of cost recovery to replace the current arrangements and for better and more accountable  management  through  the establishment of a trust account, irrespective of the level of recovery or which industries participate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the advice I have is that the intention is for further consultation with industry to settle these figures, then the actual figures will be made by regulation and there will be a chance for them to be disallowed, if that is the will of the Parliament.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on this amendment at 3.20 a.m.. I think it is ironic that the two previous amendments that the Democrats have moved this morning were considered at 1.20 a.m. and at 2.20 a.m. and now this one is being considered at 3.20 a.m., which certainly highlights the ridiculous legislative program and also the fact that primary industry legislation, of course, is always at the tail end of any parliamentary consideration, whether it is in Appropriations or in the other legislative program.</PARA></TALK.START>

I will acknowledge that Senator Bell did provide me with a copy of this amendment earlier in the week with a view to enabling it to be considered. But I do have to challenge Senator Bell and the Democrats on the issue that what they are seeking to do, of course, is in the general thrust of the policies that the coalition has announced that it will pursue. However, the Democrats have not indicated how they would fund the trust fund shortfall of money to enable the survey to continue or to be undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment would achieve little other than to make the same task unworkable. I certainly indicate that in view of the nature of the legislation and the consideration of it the amendment would have no effect on this legislation before the next Federal election. The legislation will not take effect until July next year. Between now and then there will be a Federal election and the coalition will therefore make the necessary changes, as we have already announced our policies in this area, to provide for 50 per cent of the survey and provide the appropriate funding to ensure that it can continue. Therefore, the coalition will not waste any more of the Committee's time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Preparation for the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Bill 1992 and the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Amendment Bill 1992 commenced in 1967. In July 1991 the Commonwealth, State and Territory governments agreed to replace the existing eight State and Territory registration bodies with a single national scheme to register agricultural and veterinary chemicals. These Bills establish the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals. The Authority is another step towards the development of a national registration scheme for these chemicals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Authority will replace the Australian Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Council as well as eight State and Territory statutory authorities. Its statutory power is considered necessary as it will be the national registration authority for these chemicals. The Bills do not change the arrangement for the registration of agricultural and veterinary chemicals. Another Bill to do that is expected next year. The Minister will have the power to direct the Authority in exceptional circumstance but, if he does, he must present the direction to both Houses of Parliament and it has to be reported in the Authority's annual report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Authority will have eight part time directors, appointed by the Minister for three years. They will come from industry, State government, the rural sector, the trade union movement and consumer organisations. The Authority must fully recover its costs from the ag-vet chemicals industry over the next four years. The Authority is to be given maximum flexibility to operate in a businesslike manner, free of government and Public Service restraints. It can set the terms and conditions of employment for its staff. It is being established before the main legislation relating to the national registration scheme to allow it to contribute to the development of the legislation which it will administer and to consult with interested groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian agricultural industry is one of the least intensive users of agricultural and veterinary chemicals in the world. Australian agriculture has also been one of the most careful users of agricultural and veterinary chemicals. That is a positive image and a situation that we should continue to exploit with our exports to other countries. Australian agriculture is not a heavy user of chemicals compared with many other countries, due to the fact that our agriculture is extensive rather than intensive. This means that it has a low input cost system because it gets only a low return in export markets. Much of our agricultural area has low rainfall, and this creates certain restraints on the use of agricultural and veterinary chemicals from a cost-effectiveness point of view. Also, much of our agriculture is grazing and livestock production rather than cropping. Cropping forms of agriculture are heavier users of agricultural and veterinary chemicals than the grazing industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present we have the situation in the sheep industry where the industry would be better off if it could afford to use more veterinary chemicals than is presently the case, a situation brought about by the low returns to many of those sheep farmers. On the other hand, horticulture is a more intensive user, but it has adopted a positive policy to reduce the use of agricultural chemicals. I have noted the comments made by my colleague the honourable member for Murray, the shadow Minister for primary industries, Mr Bruce Lloyd, regarding the horticultural industry's policy towards reducing the use of agricultural chemicals to biological control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The growers have a legitimate complaint because, while in Australia there are restrictions on the use of chemicals and on residue with regard to fruit, vegetables, meat, et cetera, at this stage there are not the same requirements on the products coming into Australia with which they have to compete. That is an unfair situation as well as one that is not in the best interests of the consumer. I know that progress is being made in this area. I just hope that it accelerates so that we have a situation where the standards required for people producing food in Australia are applied equally to food, or whatever it may be, that is being imported. These Bills are supported by the industry and by the coalition. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a fact that the issue of the use of chemicals in our environment and their effect on people's health is a subject with which almost everyone has some first hand knowledge. There are groups of concerned people all over the country and they are trying to bring some sanity and control into our propensity to throw chemicals around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I quote from a letter from Mr Peter Harding, president of the Australian Chemical Trauma Alliance. He wrote to me in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am writing to you to bring to your attention the number of our members who have been injured and made ill through exposure to toxic chemicals, many of them having been affected by pesticides and herbicides which have been their downfall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is bad enough that disabling illnesses frequently result from exposure to various toxins, but this is usually followed by hardship and upheaval which are indescribable to those who have not been similarly affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This stems from the fact that either insufficient is known about the ill effects of certain chemicals on the human system, or indeed because such knowledge is deliberately suppressed to make life as difficult as possible for people who are seeking redress for their injuries.</PARA>

<PARA>I do not need to read all of Mr Harding's letter, but honourable senators will get the general thrust. The central problem is that we have created a chemical industry, the end result of which is the sale of chemicals, and it is a profitable result. But it has become far too powerful. We talk about&mdash;and we hear other people talk about&mdash;clean agriculture. It is a nonsense; it is mere words and public relations. We do not yet demonstrate a commitment to chemical free agriculture. We cannot honestly promote clean food until we have chemically free food. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Select Committee on Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals in Australia, set up on the initiative of the Australian Democrats, proved to be an important catalyst in focusing our collective attention on some of these problems. The Committee reported in August 1990 and, nearly two years later, the Government has responded. It indicates an appalling lack of understanding about how important this issue really is and what a priority it is in the community. If it does not indicate that, it indicates the lack of political will regarding the priority needed to tackle these problems. Too little, far too late has resulted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The failure to address practically the problem of aerial spraying is of particular concern. The only regulation that seems to receive even tacit support of governments is a vague requirement about pilots undergoing appropriate training, as if training will prevent spraying in wind or over houses and watercourses. Those who are trained may know what is appropriate, but whether they will exercise appropriate care is another matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 45 of the Senate Select Committee on Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals in Australia called for the development of a uniform approach to its regulation and, in the event that such regulations are not implemented, that aerial spraying should be banned. No uniform regulations are in place, nor will this legislation put them in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Equally, we as a community and as a government have refused to address the problems in the environment caused by uncontrolled and widespread use of pesticides in agriculture. This is not because of inadequate powers; it is pure lack of will. The current Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act states that the functions of the Australian Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Council are, amongst other things, to evaluate the effects of the use of chemical products. That is simply not being done. If it were, we would have a small army of people monitoring the effects of this stuff in rivers and waterways throughout the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, we debated the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Amendment Bill, which was about labelling and the machinery set up to monitor the operation of the labelling system of the wine industry. If it is good enough for wine and brandy to receive proper monitoring of the standards imposed, why is it not good enough to have a proper monitoring system of the use of chemicals? I remember speaking on the Wine and Brandy Corporation Amendment Bill and realising as I spoke that here we had a special Act of Parliament, a whole bureaucracy and a bunch of inspectors authorised to ensure that what was in the bottle was what was described on the label. We think that is important for wine and brandy, but the other things we consume are not similarly labelled or policed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we were serious about our professed concern for the effects of chemicals on the environment, we would set up a register of complaints and treatments attributable to exposure to chemicals because significant numbers of people&mdash;far too many&mdash;are suffering from the fallout of the effects of chemicals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area of immense concern not only to individuals, but particularly to municipal councils throughout the country, is the problem of what to do with waste chemicals. Recently, the Beaconsfield Council in northern Tasmania asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Crean, how to overcome a particular problem it had in disposing of dangerous agricultural chemical containers. The Minister is reported to have sent the council a draft protocol for the management of containers. That does not help that council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noticed in a recent edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">NSW Farmers News</EMPHASIS> that this concern is now shared by the farming community, to the point of recommending a deposit system on chemical containers to encourage the return of excess chemicals and containers. This Bill provides no indication that that will in fact happen, but it ought to, or else, as the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association believes, irreparable damage could be caused to the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are instances where that is demonstrable. A case in point in Tasmania, one which is famous and well recognised, is that of a driver of a roadmaking grader involved in a road building project near Scamander on the east cost. While travelling through reasonably easy country for road building, the driver encountered some mysterious barrels, some of which were opened by the passage of the grader. The driver suffered terrible consequences. He was unable to continue work, the symptoms were very difficult to diagnose and the materials were also difficult to identify. The poor man is unable to work in his previous occupation. Through no fault of his own, he had unearthed what are suspected to be unused containers and discarded containers of agricultural chemicals. They had been placed in the dump because there had been, and still are, inadequate procedures for the disposal of such things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government, however, is saying that it is committed to cleaning up Australia's chemicals. I quote from the 1990-91 report of the Australian Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Council:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is essential that there is a comprehensive system for the regulation and control of these chemicals in Australia which could not be achieved through market forces and which, accordingly, requires the intervention of Government.</PARA>
<PARA>The Democrats welcome that, but we want clear evidence that it is going to happen. Hence we will be moving amendments&mdash;not many, nor as strong as I think perhaps they should be.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are moments when we believe things are happening and progress is being made. On 7 December I gave notice that I would move that we note with approval that the National Health and Medical Research Council has recommended the phasing out of cyclodienes, a type of organochlorin which has previously been used to poison termites and funnel ants. I did so with some degree of satisfaction because the NHMRC had advised that, during the next two years, the poison should only be used in areas which are not easily accessible to humans, and the Australian Consumers Association and Greenpeace had both welcomed the recommendations, saying that improved building practices could stop destruction by termites without added chemical risks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I proposed that notice of motion in the Senate, I did so very happily and in a frame of mind of anticipating that this was going to happen. I have since been advised that the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Council has chosen to undermine the progress of those recommendations and I am very suspicious now about the future opportunities there. Yet several hours ago, while watching one of the late night programs on ABC television, we were shown in colour several alternative methods for building a house on mainland Australia. In Tasmania we do not suffer the problems of termites but the poor unfortunate souls on the mainland here seem to have a lot of fuss and bother with them. There we saw in colour some very simple alternative building methods involving the use of crushed granite, metal, woven steel mesh or cloth placed in the right places, and consideration being given to the problem rather than throwing chemicals about with little thought for what they might do if retained in the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is possible&mdash;it is not an economic difficulty; in fact, it is an economic advantage&mdash;to consider carefully the use of chemicals in our environment. I suggest that this Bill does little to encourage us to take those measures. It does little to make a firm commitment to reducing the use of unnecessary chemicals in our environment. I will be moving amendments in the committee stage which will attempt to redress its inadequacies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I begin to comment specifically on some shortcomings that I perceive in the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Bill, I would like to touch on some broader issues that I feel will need to be addressed by the Government in the near future. In her book, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Signs of hope: working towards our common future</EMPHASIS>, Linda Starke points to the increasing profile being given to the problems associated with the use and overuse of pesticides and fertilisers. She illustrates some initiatives being taken by other governments to minimise the use of pesticides and states, for example:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some governments are moving beyond pesticide regulation. A 1987 law in Denmark, for instance, gives farmers financial support to develop or convert to organic farming. An Organic Farming Council was set up in July of that year to promote this agricultural method and monitor developments.</PARA>
<PARA>In the south-west of Western Australia, there is a developing competitive market for organic farming which I believe is very positive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The role of integrated pest management in reducing dependence on chemicals was also discussed by Ms Starke. She gives an example of initiatives taken by the Indonesian Government when she says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Indonesian Government may have taken some of the boldest steps to support IPM. In late 1986 fifty seven pesticides were banned and a national promotion of less environmentally harmful pest control began. A year later, subsidies for the use of remaining pesticides on rice were cut, as the success of IPM became clear to more farmers.</PARA>
<PARA>I trust that our own Government has taken note of these initiatives by other nations to reduce the dependence of our agricultural industries on chemicals. Whilst the registration initiatives proposed in this Bill are laudable in themselves, they should properly be placed in the context of a broader move to ecologically sustainable agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Bill, sadly, does not appear to include any reference to the need to operate within the principles of ecologically sustainable development. As with a previous Bill we have been discussing, this omission reduces the credibility of the legislation. The final report of the Ecologically Sustainable Development Working Group on Agriculture pointed to the fact that `chemicals are an issue in the context of ecologically sustainable agriculture'. It would therefore seem appropriate that the major Federal legislation dealing with the registration and use of chemicals in the agricultural and veterinary industries incorporates a reference to, and definition of, ecologically sustainable development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to state here that the incorporation of ESD principles into the Bill should be seen not as a hindrance to better economic performance, but rather as the creation of an opportunity for the Australian agricultural industry to create a reputation and a niche for the supply of pesticide free and healthy food to the rest of the world. By its very nature, this export opportunity will be sustainable and not driven by short term profit motives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue that I would like to touch on in this debate relates to the need for environmental monitoring and research into the ecological and health impacts of both agricultural and veterinary chemicals. One mechanism to fund such research was raised in the final report of the ESD working group on agriculture where reference was made to the possibility of placing a levy on chemical and fertiliser usage. This is consistent with the polluter pays principle, which has been advocated by many studies into the environmental problems facing both Australia and the planet as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Sweden this approach has already been adopted. The Swedish Government's report to the UNCED conference which was held in Rio De Janeiro earlier this year pointed to the establishment of a chemicals inspectorate, which is responsible for both environmental and health aspects of chemicals. The report went on to say that the chemicals inspectorate is financed through charges on chemical products and pesticides. It should be pointed out that this call for monitoring and research should not be seen as an excuse for a business as usual approach by the ag-vet chemicals industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is sufficient evidence already in existence to create considerable concern in the community about the health and ecological impacts of some agricultural and veterinary chemicals. The Government should be responding to these concerns by implementing major changes in the way that these industries are allowed to use the chemicals. The legislative approach is, however, limited and the Government should also be considering following the lead of the Danish Government in promoting organic farming techniques through some form of incentives scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I would like to address briefly some issues relating to the administrative and decision making procedures to be adopted by the National Registration Authority. Whilst I was pleased that consumer groups are represented on the NRA, I was wondering about the importance of the inclusion of environment and conservation groups. There is no reference in the Bill to such issues as appeals procedures and the procedures for notifying decisions of the NRA and the rationale behind those decisions. I feel that it is important that the general public feel some confidence in such an important authority as the NRA. This can only be achieved through an open public consultation process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I trust that these issues will be adequately addressed by the Government in the promised follow-up legislation in the Autumn session. In this context, I also trust that the matter of community right to know will be addressed. I refer the Senate to an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Green Left Weekly</EMPHASIS> of 28 October 1992 where it comments that Australia lags on chemical right to know law. Australia has no community right to know legislation and only limited worker right to know provisions. The March 1992 final report of the independent Coode Island review panel investigating the Coode Island fire recommended:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the government agree in principle to a legislated Community Right to Know to assist public understanding of hazardous materials and production processes.</PARA>
<PARA>So far no party&mdash;State or Federal&mdash;has done anything about this. However, I am please to note that today independent Senator Janet Powell tabled a draft private member's Bill, the Toxic Chemicals (Community Right to Know) Bill; hopefully to receive some attention in reference to this legislation. I conclude by urging that the opportunity provided by this Bill, to deal responsibly with the use of chemicals within the agricultural and veterinary practices, should be grasped. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on these amendments of the Australian Democrats at almost 3.55 a.m., in the further saga of this late night session on these particular issues. Whilst we are looking at the issue of agricultural and veterinary chemicals, I think it would tax many of us to know the sorts of chemicals that are obviously affecting all of us at this hour of the morning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One particular amendment needs to be looked at very carefully because the night owls of the Democrats who always want to come out at these ungodly hours of the morning to do their bidding and to look after their mates, are very obviously reflected in this amendment. The Democrats are moving an amendment to the Bill which enables an environmentalist to sit on the board of the National Registration Authority. The Bill clearly sets out that there are to be members appointed to the Authority from a wide range of industry sectors, including two directors having experience in the regulation of chemical products under the law of a State or Territory. I would have thought that many of the people suitably qualified under that clause would have had considerable environmental experience and not necessarily have to be identified with the words `environmental protection'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are to be two directors who have experience in the industry. Of course, the Democrats are seeking to reduce that number to one as a trade-off in this amendment. I would have thought that any directors recruited from industry would hold tertiary qualifications, and it ought not be assumed that anyone who comes out of industry does not have a great deal of simpatico and identification with the environment. There is to be one director who has experience in the protection of the interests of the consumers. Again, I would have thought that many people eminently qualified in that area would be well experienced in environmental protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill sets out that there is to be one director who has experience in primary production. Certainly, anybody who comes from that particular industry already has a very close environmental link. There is to be one director who has experience in occupational health and safety as an officer or employee of an organisation of employees. Again, anyone working in that field is eminently qualified and competent in the areas that naturally have an impact on the environment. The Bill also clearly sets out with whom the authorities should consult. These include persons who are involved with industry, the Commonwealth or State governments, persons with interests in matters pertaining to the industry, including of course, the scientific community, and persons who either have a particular interest in consumers or in the protection of the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is of the view, firstly, that the Democrat concerns have already been addressed in this Bill and, secondly, that such an appointment to the Authority is totally unnecessary, due to the fact that chemicals are already required by law to be registered in Australia and have to pass through stringent environmental testing. This is really just another pitch by the Democrats for a job for the boys for one of their members or someone who holds a strong view&mdash;perhaps someone associated with Greenpeace or another like-minded organisation&mdash;for a particular government sponsored position in a paid area. I believe the Bill already adequately covers the issues that Senator Bell is seeking to incorporate through this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In deference to the hour I was hoping to be brief on this. I moved without glorification or vilification. I must rise to counter some of the baseless accusations that have been shovelled in my direction. The fact is that we have a demonstrated inadequacy by the Australian Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Council which I will demonstrate shortly. The Democrats were trying to ensure that such an inadequacy was not repeated in relation to the composition of the body that is being proposed here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a fact that the NHMRC made recommendations which I alluded to earlier and it is a fact that the Australian Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Council released a press release on 8 December soon after I had made the observation that the recommendations of the NHMRC were to be welcomed. In responding to those recommendations, the press release by the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Council says in part that the Council had given consideration to the recent Duggan report on organochlorin insecticides, that it would like to see all these persistent chemicals removed from use and replaced by a suitable alternative and that&mdash;and I emphasise this&mdash;the matter is controversial and complex and therefore the Council will be seeking further advice before taking a definitive position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that that demonstrates that the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Council did not have within it the expertise to recognise the inherent quality of the recommendations by the NHMRC. I suggest that before we construct another body to replace this Council we ensure that it has the capacity to not get bogged down seeking further advice and that it has that advice within its very own boundaries. That is why we have proposed this amendment. I recommend that the Committee seriously consider this amendment. That is why I refute the motives which have been ascribed to me by Senator Tambling. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal and National parties are opposed to the central purpose of this legislation, which is to extend Comcare's tentacles into providing workers compensation for privatised former government business enterprises and for sections of the private sector, and will oppose those sections of the legislation giving effect to that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Comcare system as it presently stands, underwent certain reforms in the recent past which have been touted by Comcare as basic reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those reforms limit some of the benefits which were available under the system, and modified some of the procedural aspects of the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They have been presented by Comcare as having basically altered the way in which Comcare is administered, and having also basically altered the benefits available under the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real position however, when looked at in comparison to the reforms which have been made in NSW and which are about to be made in Victoria, is that those reforms can be more properly characterised as tinkering about the edges of the problems which exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The compensation provisions under Comcare are excessively generous in comparison with the State systems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, administrative changes have been made in Comcare in accord with the recommendations of the Brown inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the cost-saving changes from the Brown recommendations have not seen the light of day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is, that the level of benefits is a major part of Comcare's cost structure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The benefits provided for the public sector, under Comcare, remain better than provided by other systems for the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">State governments have a number of problems with this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These include that the Comcare proposal was developed without prior consultation with the States. States are concerned at the lack of consultation and major implications for State workers' compensation schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They made this clear at the Labour Minister's meeting on 30 October 1992, following earlier meetings of officials on 9 September and 1 October 1992 which failed to clarify issues of concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am told that even Minister Cook's Labor colleague, the Minister of Labour in South Australia, Bob Gregory, gave him a real touch up at the meeting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, all States considered that the extension of Comcare outside privatised Commonwealth organisations is unnecessary and have raised a number of fundamental issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the recent Labour Minister's meeting, it was noted that States/Territories did not object to the concept behind the Commonwealth proposal of making the administrative burden on major corporations much less across Australia and having much greater uniformity between the States (seen as very sound objectives). But that this needed to be done in a much more considered way and with consultation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the Commonwealth proposal introduces another layer of self insurance which is unnecessary and complicates, rather than simplifies, insurance and benefit arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All States are concerned that Comcare has not yet developed self insurance licensing criteria and is unable to clarify how boundaries will be defined between the extended coverage available under Comcare and State legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The work cover board in NSW does not support the Comcare proposal as currently presented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's proposal raises major concerns for Workcover arrangements at State level in regard to the potential cost impact on State schemes and premiums, licensing arrangements for self-insurers, benefit anomalies, and the impact on occupational health and safety and dispute resolution services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These concerns are shared by State governments, the administrators of State workers' compensation schemes and employers. The general view of employers is that the proposal is ill-considered in detail and apt to destroy the integrity of State schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First among contentious issues causing States and employers to oppose this legislation is their questioning of its constitutionality. This persists despite the opinion of the Commonwealth acting Solicitor-General, Dennis Rose Q.C., that the proposed amendments to the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 are a valid exercise of powers under section 51 (XX) of the Constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, are its benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation will create two classes of workers and benefit entitlements within an industry, resulting in a further anomaly in workers compensation benefits at an industry level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Comcare provides more generous benefits after 26 weeks (70 per cent of normal weekly earnings until age 65).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employers who swap jurisdictions will have to administer both Workcover and Comcare benefit systems, because of existing Workcover claimants, and bear any consequent increase in administrative costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation envisages there will be one scheme for workers in large national corporations and one scheme for those who work in locally based companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consequence of such a proposal is that two workers in the same industry, within the same State or Territory, would receive different financial burdens, in terms of premiums and compensation payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that it has been a very strong point of contention that commonwealth government employees have been treated differently from the rest of the Australian workforce for many years, it would seem a grave mistake to exacerbate that sort of situation throughout every State and Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, is the potential impact on the cost and financial viability of State schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The likely cost impact on State systems cannot be assessed until Comcare can provide a clear definition in regard to competing industries and licensing requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However if many large employers leave the State system to take up the Comcare option this will reduce the premium pool remaining to fund certain industry sectors in the States' schemes and could increase premium levels for employers remaining in that sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There would also be pressure on the State schemes to match the higher benefits provided by Comcare, with a further consequent increase in State scheme premiums.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my understanding that the Federal government has failed to undertake any research into this aspect of the proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, are concerns regarding occupational health and safety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the legislation, occupational health and safety will remain a State responsibility which will create an anomaly in the administration and funding of occupational health and safety services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employers fund the administration of occupational health and safety services via the Workcover levy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth proposes that licensing arrangements will require corporations to contribute to State occupational health and safety programs. However it will be the responsibility of States to legislate for and collect such monies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is administratively cumbersome and likely to be unenforceable by the States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal in effectively separating compensation and rehabilitation away from occupational health and safety, heads in exactly the opposite direction of State systems, which recognise the importance of integrating occupational health and safety, rehabilitation and compensation services basic to prevention and rehabilitation objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly employers want a single regulator of occupational health and safety, rehabilitation and compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fifthly is the issue of transferability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth proposes that organisations will be able to transfer to national coverage, through Comcare self insurance, and revert to the State system if they choose. The mechanism for achieving transferability and administering outstanding claims has not been clarified. States are concerned that Comcare fully supervise any self-insurer they license and the resulting claims run-off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation does not appear to absolve State systems of responsibility for the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But practicality demands that there be only one regulator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is essential to look at the totality of any particular individual's claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A State system would be very wary of accepting anyone back from Comcare coverage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sixthly, is the matter of licensing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Criteria for licensing self-insurers have yet to be developed. It appears that this will be left to Comcare and regulated under a ministerial discretion, as criteria are not specified in the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Comcare has advised it will consult with States on the licensing policy which is proposed to be finalised by early 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not acceptable for this legislation to pass with such an important matter unresolved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to know where the boundary lies between the State and Comcare systems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This remains unclear, with Comcare either unable or unwilling to say what the self-insurance rules will be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where indeed do the boundaries lie for the private sector to come under Comcare?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Ansett joins because it is allowed to as a competitor with the privatised, former Government business enterprise, Qantas, can the rest of the TNT Group?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">And what about Compass?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Australia Post joins, what about private career firms?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there is real concern about the uncertainty relating to the boundary definitions of industry competitors of present and former, now privatised, Government business enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Related to this is the inconsistency of the `all in or all out' condition of coverage with the so-called level playing field, which this proposal purports to create.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`All in or all out' prevents competition between the States which is essential to maximise any benefits, achievable from a level playing field.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`All in or all out', prevents some State branches of national enterprises being under State compensation systems, while other branches are under Comcare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, Qantas in Queensland could not remain under the State scheme there, while Qantas elsewhere moved in under Comcare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This entrenches a lack of competitive efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also raises the question of what happens to smaller companies operating in only one State, who nevertheless compete with national firms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Will Comcare take them on?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This in turn raises possible constitutional problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the proposal to offer self-insurance does not extend to smaller companies operating within States, nor to some trading between States, then the claim to be producing a level playing field is fundamentally flawed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This proposal will not create a `level playing field' as claimed. A level playing field should provide uniformity in benefits which strike a rational balance between equity for workers and affordability for employers and allows States to compete against the Commonwealth for coverage of other Government national enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the present time, a genuinely level playing field would see coverage move from Comcare to the State systems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, benefits under Comcare are more generous than under most, if not all, State systems. Thus lower costs would be achievable through the State systems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A level playing field should be achieved by the Federal Government working with the States to achieve national consistency in benefits, premiums, occupational health and safety, and subsequently opening up competition for service delivery to the States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a question of the most appropriate way to get to a level playing field or uniformity in benefits. A far better way than this Government's back door method through this legislation is to bring the systems together cooperatively, as is already happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employers are not convinced of Comcare's competitiveness based on average premium rates. They need a comparison of industry rates being offered for targeted industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Seventhly, there is concern about claims management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is widespread belief that self-insurers under Comcare should remain responsible for claims management. But under this Bill, Comcare will offer a claims management service under its self-insurance arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is contrary to, for example, New South Wales Workcover's licensing policy which requires employers to manage claims effectively as a necessary component of operating as a self-insurer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Several large NSW self-insurers have informally indicated their opposition to this aspect of the proposal. It is an important matter of principle that self-insuring employers manage employees claims and deal directly with those employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only if employers insure with an external organisation should their claims be managed externally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the eighth matter, liability, all States are apprehensive at a failure of a Comcare self-insurer could affect State employers and some financial contribution could be required from insurers/employers in each State. This would not be acceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employers are concerned about the failure of the Federal Government to check its unfunded liability in workers' compensation. This is reinforced by earlier qualification of Comcare's accounts by the Auditor-General regarding whether past claims are fully funded.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us regain composure. The honourable member reminded us that he was leading on behalf of the National and Liberal parties and in part of his speech he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main purpose of this Bill is to allow the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Act to cover certain corporations outside the Commonwealth public sector for what are, it must be said, very practical and supportable reasons. It would cause unnecessary complications if privatised Government organisations were unable to compete under current Commonwealth arrangements. By the same token, it could be seen as unfair if private corporations competing against recently privatised government agencies were not able to avail themselves of the same compensation regime if they so chose. In any event, I think the outcome is rather unlikely.</PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member then continued to tell us of the benefits of the scheme and how wonderful it was. I think there can be no greater authority than that which is given by the honourable member for Gwydir, who then told us that the coalition would not be opposing the Bill. In light of that, I think the advice that we were given at that stage should lead us to recognise the virtues of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats, however, have been particularly concerned. We thought that the advice that was given by the National and Liberal parties in the lower House was advice which was not particularly well founded, nor was it particularly applicable to this Bill. We were concerned that in fact the Bill could achieve several problems for those who had been attempting to get proper workers compensation cover. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats had drawn the attention of the Senate previously to problems with licensed Workcare coverage&mdash;workers compensation coverage which was provided by Telecom. That licensed coverage was supposed to be supervised by Comcare and we have in the past illustrated the inadequacies that had existed. I am pleased to say that many of those inadequacies have been addressed subsequent to our raising that in the Senate. Nevertheless, it seems that this Bill could have been introduced with undue haste, without being assured that potential licensees had the capacity to deliver a full and comprehensive coverage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was another problem that we saw with this legislation. We suspected that the motivation of the administering body may not reside in delivering an effective and equitable scheme of coverage to potential clients but, rather, may be motivated more by seeking to make a commercial profit or operating a commercially viable operation. Those fears made us examine the legislation very carefully, and we have since been assured that our fears are misplaced. We hope that that assurance is so. I do not think that I need to labour the point any longer. The point is made. We will be supporting the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am reading from what I said. Mr McLeay required the bicycle to be delivered to his rooms in Parliament House. So it is somewhat different, but I do not know that it is so different in the consequence, because it still seems that at least the staff of Mr McLeay were made aware of the danger in relation to the bicycle. In fact, from the document just tabled by the President, the staff member of Mr McLeay is reported to have replied, when given this warning, `We know all about the bikes'. The staff member then required that the arrangements go ahead. According to that document, the staff member offered warnings on a further two occasions.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think we are all anxious to avoid prejudging this matter. Quite clearly it is a matter of public interest and concern because public moneys are involved. As Senator Hill has just pointed out, in considering whether concerns were conveyed to a staff member of Mr McLeay, it is also very important to know whether those concerns were then relayed by the staff member to Mr McLeay himself because that would materially affect his knowledge, his awareness of the condition of the bike, and the circumstances under which it should be ridden. It would therefore be a material circumstance to be taken into account in assessing the way in which any settlement might be negotiated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, as Senator Cooney would be aware, the plaintiff has to prove his case. If there are evidentiary deficiencies or suggestions that somehow he was aware that there were problems with the bike in question, then that obviously must affect the prospects of success or even the chances of a reduction for contributory negligence. That would then be reflected in any offer made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I stress that the only material that has been made available is the file provided by the Joint House Department. The Speaker has made it clear that he regards himself as having nothing to hide and he wants all the documents made publicly available. Therefore, we are awaiting further material from the Australian Government Solicitor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one simply looks at the material that is contained in the file kept by the Joint House Department, all that one finds in relation to the measure of damages is a single medical report and a single legal opinion. The medical report is one from an orthopaedic surgeon who examined the plaintiff on a couple of occasions prior to an operation conducted by a neurosurgeon. We do not know whether the orthopaedic surgeon examined him subsequently, but certainly there is no medical report to that effect. There is certainly no opinion from the neurosurgeon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those are critical matters in making any sensible judgment as to the extent of any injury or any continuing disability and certainly any residual consequences from the operation. One would clearly need to be in possession of a series of medical reports, not only from the plaintiff but, of course, independent medical assessments made by doctors commissioned on behalf of the defendant. None of those medical reports are available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one then looks at the legal opinion, one finds that that does not even refer to a medical report. It simply makes some very scanty references to the plaintiff's alleged state of health and then proceeds to suggest that somehow this claim is worth $30,000 to $50,000. As we know, the matter was settled for approximately $50,000 for general damages, plus medical expenses, plus legal costs. It was settled right at the top of the range. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The material also indicates that at all times the defendant was bending over backwards to settle the matter as quickly as possible. There was never any serious attempt to investigate the question of liability and there was certainly no attempt to negotiate in the normal sense, which means making a lower offer than one ultimately expects to be able to resolve the matter for. The Department simply took a figure, offered it, and then paid it into court, and Mr McLeay took it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one reads the final correspondence, one finds the absolutely laughable proposition that, because Mr McLeay had asked for $100,000 and the Department got out of it for $50,000, it got a very good settlement. One might as well say that if McLeay had asked for half a million and we only gave him $200,000 we would have done even better because we would have got more than a 50 per cent discount. Quite clearly, there is very scant material available to justify anything like a $50,000 payout for general damages. After all, as Senator Herron, who knows a lot more about this than I do, would confirm, on the face of it the medical evidence suggests that there was only a very limited disability in terms of limitation of movement of the arm. Mr McLeay chose not to pursue physiotherapy on more than four occasions. Quite clearly, that exercise would have assisted his cause. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another thing I find quite extraordinary is that this accident happened on Anzac Day. Mr McLeay went to see his general practitioner, a Dr Rosemary Crowley, on the same day, was referred to the specialist and saw the specialist the following day, by which time he had been to see his solicitor, who had written a letter to the gymnasium section of this House, asking them to hold on to the bike as evidence. In other words, Mr McLeay was incredibly speedy in pursuing his legal rights but not so speedy in pursuing any attempt to resolve his medical condition to the extent that he had a capacity to do that by undertaking physiotherapy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He claims that he cannot play tennis and he was not able to pursue his intention to take up golf. Do honourable senators like that one? In other words, it was not as if he was a champion sportsman cut down in mid-stride. All that he was denied was the opportunity to take up golf. One might as well say he was denied the opportunity to pursue a career as a league footballer or anything else that he turned his mind to. That is another matter. He lost his seat and he has got another one which has about a 4 or 5 per cent safety margin, so he is not doing too badly. To a certain extent that would affect the question of future economic loss and, of course, they were trotting out arguments about whether he would be able to resume his position as an organiser, as though that is some sort of honourable profession. I would have thought his chances were limited as a Telecom technician. But that was not pursued. This matter was resolved on the basis of general damages for pain and suffering and loss of enjoyment of life. All I can say is if I had been acting for the plaintiff, on that medical evidence I would have grabbed $10,000. Indeed, there are people in this place who would not have even made a claim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important thing is that we need a lot more material and I think the public does too in order to be in any way satisfied or persuaded that this claim was worth anything like $50,000. In those circumstances it is a matter of very real concern to us that the President did not become involved. Quite clearly, the Speaker is not able to effectively give instructions to the Crown Solicitor or the Government Solicitor and therefore he should not only have stood aside but someone else should have been in there conducting the matter on his behalf. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Crichton-Browne pointed out earlier today, it puts the head of the Department, Mr Bolton, in a very invidious position. It is almost impossible for him to make a sensible judgment. Certainly, if he was so minded to make an offer on the low side, or to try to pursue genuine compromise, he would be exposed to enormous indirect pressure. That is why I think we need to know more about why the President, who presumably was aware at a fairly early stage that Mr McLeay had been injured, and that he was bringing proceedings, did not then intervene to ensure that the matter was conducted very much at arms length. By that I mean in such a way that someone was able to give sensible instructions. As it turned out, Mr Bolton simply handed it over, washed his hands of the matter, and I suppose one can understand that. It was then left on the implied basis that they would get out of this as quickly and as expensively as possible. That is not in the public interest. </PARA>

Senator Ray said earlier that there are two aspects&mdash;whether there has been due process on the one hand and whether the compensation has been adequate for the injuries sustained.

The report was written six months after the original injury.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of interesting aspects in the evidence that has been presented to us. Mr McLeay's total out of pocket expenses were in the vicinity of $600 for medical expenses and $2,600 for hospital expenses. He gets $65,000 for that. There are no other medical reports. There was not even one from the operating neurosurgeon. A second opinion has not been presented to us, at all. In my professional experience, I have never heard of this occurring. We have not been given anything that justifies the compensation of $65,000 for something of this nature. He suffered an undisplaced fracture of the elbow.

When this matter was raised in the chamber by Senator Hill in his questions to you initially, Senator Hill twice said in that speech, `I have heard a rumour around the building that Mr McLeay was on an exercise bike', implying that it was a fixed bike. The second rumour he ran in this chamber was, `I have heard that Mr McLeay went outside and constructed the exercise bike'. He did not have an exercise bike; he did not construct the bike, but that was the rumour run in here the other day. Basing these speeches simply on rumour without substance can be very damaging.

The publicity given to the accusation that Senator Hill made, which he believed was based on good information, did the Speaker immense damage when it was carried across the news broadcasts in this country.

If honourable senators want to concentrate on the general principles then that is the function of this Parliament, but by just coming in here and throw around unsubstantiated rumour and muck, without a proper and adequate apology when it is disproved by just asking more questions, they are not doing this chamber any good whatsoever. A couple of people interjected and said, `What am I doing on my feet defending someone who I have always had a close relationship with?'.

What I claimed by imputation was that, by the strength of the Speaker's character, as a result of his relationship with Mr Bolton, as a result of Mr Bolton's general demeanour towards him and the Speaker's knowledge of him, Mr Bolton could not ever be held to be perfectly immune from the influence of Mr McLeay. To that extent, Mr McLeay should have sought to find a separation between himself and Mr Bolton in terms of the decision that was to be made. The obvious way of doing that was through the Committee.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a couple of other points from the file that need to be on the record. The problem with this matter is that when you are dealing with a Presiding Officer and a sensitive matter such as this, not only does it have to be scrupulously carried out but it has to be seen to be done in that fashion as well. Quite frankly, the file does not show that that was done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The accident took place on 25 April 1990. There was a file note stating that on 10 April 1991 the strategy by the Government Solicitor was that they should seek to settle the matter with no admission of liability. There was the question also of whether the manufacturer of the bicycle should be held liable in the matter. The way that that is normally dealt with is that when the writ or statement of claim is issued there would be a joining in of the manufacturer as a co-defendant. If one settles on the writ at a very early stage, of course, that does not take place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a file note also on 17 April 1991 further stating what the strategy was to be, and the strategy is written as this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">McLeay's solicitors will be issuing a formal claim. The Australian Government Solicitor, Sienkowski, has spoken with them. Once this is done, the settlement negotiations can be concluded fairly quickly. Aim is to settle against McLeay and then look at the manufacturer for some indemnity. Sienkowski to put this to me in writing. In accordance with that strategy, process was duly issued in September 1991. Settlement was then recommended&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SE4">Senator BISHOP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The flow of the debate was interrupted by Senator Faulkner. To continue, the process began in September 1991. There was an instruction that was subject to Mr Bolton confirming it. The file note is dated 25 November 1991. It says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sienkowski rang to advise that Mr McLeay's solicitor had advised that Mr McLeay wished to accept the offer of $55,000. After deducting medical expenses already paid, the balance was $51,205.55. After confirming with Mr Bolton, I advised Mr Sienkowski to proceed with the offer. He will send a form 12 and seek to recover some of these costs from the manufacturers. Payment was duly made then on 26 November.</PARA>
<PARA>To put it mildly, the speed with which this matter was processed was quite out of the norm. There was another matter concerning somebody in this chamber. The accident took place in 1988. Settlement was not effected until this month, indeed 48 hours ago, and it was settled at the court door where proper process was issued and where normal court proceedings were gone through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The injury was far more serious than the Speaker's. I do know what the figures were, but that perhaps is for somebody else to disclose and not for me to deal with. It was a far more serious accident, with the same sorts of figures, and the case was conducted from 1988 to 1992. There was no speed, no little notes, and none of the ease with which the Speaker's matter was resolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty is that Mr Bolton is responsible to the Presiding Officer. The difficulty is that there was no bringing in of the Joint House Committee. There seems to have been no arm's length negotiations. That is the whole problem with this sorry mess. It may well be that the injury was such that the settlement figure was appropriate. It may well be that proper processes could have been gone through and the same result would have been come to but, quite frankly, this is not what could be called a normal legal case. It does not match up with another case of which I am fully apprised where somebody was also in a position such as this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why this matter has been raised. That is why people are angry about it. They feel that it was not properly conducted and dealt with. An advantage has been given to somebody who was in a position of authority and who perhaps exercised that authority. Whether or not that was done, I suppose we will never really know. What we do know is that the person who benefited was in a position of authority over the person who exercised the authority to settle. Mr Bolton issued that authority to settle. Those dates speak for themselves. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some remarks ought to be made in reply to what has been said by honourable senators opposite. What has been bandied across the chamber today, from both sides, is an interpretation that each side has put on a set of facts. Both sides have acted as advocates. It can hardly be suggested that honourable senators opposite are going to bring to this issue a mind that is clear of particular perceptions. They hope that there may be political advantage to be gained. There is no denying on this side that we are going to go to the aid, if it were necessary, of the Speaker.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are doing is exchanging perceptions. The actual facts of the matter are probably not greatly in dispute. The Speaker was injured when a bike collapsed under him. It is quite clear that that was negligent. The people who supplied the Speaker with the bike knew that it was a dangerous thing to do. An experiment was carried out which showed that the bike collapsed. I understand what honourable senators opposite are saying. They do not dispute that there was negligence. What is disputed is the amount that was paid to the Speaker. Honourable senators opposite say that the amount of just over $50,000, with costs, was too much. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I can say about the way it was handled is that there is no doubt that the Speaker got a settlement which was a very good settlement. That was done on the basis of an opinion from a Mr G. Stretton which no doubt honourable senators have got hold of. There was no suggestion that Mr Stretton was in any way under the influence of Mr McLeay. Mr Stretton is a solicitor or a barrister who is in private practice. Mr Stretton is a barrister or a solicitor who was briefed, as I understand it, by the Australian Solicitor, the old Crown Solicitor. They are the facts that we have got to work with. Honourable senators opposite put an interpretation on that and say, `Look, that is all consistent with the Speaker using improper influence'. That is the real charge being made, that of improper influence either in terms of reality or, as Senator Bishop touched on, improper influence that can be at least constructively placed upon the Speaker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter, and nobody has denied it, is that the Speaker was entitled to sue. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SF4">Senator COONEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us say that Senator Alston had injured his leg very badly. Why should Senator Alston not sue if he has a serious injury? So the real problem is the extent of the damages; the way it was dealt with and the extent of the damages. This matter was dealt with by obtaining an opinion and, as I understand it&mdash;I have listened carefully to this whole debate&mdash;nobody has attacked the opinion of Mr Stretton. I do not know Mr Stretton. Honourable senators have not got up and said, `Mr Stretton, you were wrong in this. You approached this with mala fides and in some way you have given your opinion under the influence of the Speaker'. I have not heard it suggested at all from the other side that Mr Stretton was under the influence of the Speaker. I have heard it put that Mr Bolton was under the influence of the Speaker, but he did not make that assessment of damages.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was Mr Stretton who was at arm's length not only from Mr McLeay but also from the Parliament because he is outside the Parliament. I am happy to be corrected upon that but, as I understand it, he is a person who runs a private practice and he was the one who made the assessment. It was on the basis of his assessment that everything flowed. Can honourable senators opposite show me that Mr Stretton was in some way acting improperly? They have to show that it is more than making a generous assessment, they have to show that he in some way acted improperly because he was under the influence of the Speaker or because he wanted to curry favour. That has not even been alleged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is not Mr Bolton who is in the firing line, as it were; it is Mr Bolton acting on the advice ultimately from the Australian Government Solicitor and that office acting on the advice of Mr Stretton and that coming through to Mr McLeay. If Mr McLeay is offered an amount of money, why should he not take it? If Mr McLeay is told that his injuries are worth that much, why should he not take it? If Senator Alston gave advice to a client which was overgenerous advice&mdash;and in the old days he used to give advice, as I remember, and we would say that it was outrageous and then he would go and get the amount claimed&mdash;nobody criticised him for that. What they were saying is, `There is Richard Alston doing well again'. I would imagine, with great respect, that Senator Alston would have put a bigger figure on this, and come down, of course. If Senator Alston, as a responsible barrister&mdash;which he was, and a very good one, may I say, and one I always respected&mdash;gave that advice, he would have expected it to be accepted. That is what this is all about. Why should a person not take the advice of counsel?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Alston says that he does not refer to the report. That is a criticism of the counsel who was involved. If counsel has written a bad opinion, perhaps one could criticise him for that. But if counsel writes an opinion that says, `Offer this much', and that much is offered, then why should not the person to whom it is offered say, `Yes, I will have it.'? That is what has happened here. The only way one can get over the problem is to somehow impugn Mr Stretton. He is the fellow who has to be hit on the head, as it were, not Mr Bolton. Mr Bolton is simply taking the advice he gets from the Office of the Australian Government Solicitor, which gave its advice on the basis of what Mr Stretton said. </PARA>

What action, if any, does he propose to take and how does he see his responsibilities now these particular matters have arisen?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) It is not possible to give an accurate figure of how many `professional workers' are registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES), as the codes which cover the `professional' categories also include a number of non-professional occupations.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) The value of such activities for professionals depends on the particular barriers to employment that individuals may experience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) Overseas professionals may receive bridging training under JOBTRAIN to enable them to gain Australian recognition of their overseas qualifications.

This provision does not permit overseas professionals to acquire additional qualifications beyond those they already had in their country of origin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) The Social Security Act provides the Department of Employment, Education and Training with the discretion, delegated from the Secretary of the Department of Social Security, to require or permit NSA recipients to undertake educational courses. In this context, guidelines were developed in consultation with the Department of Social Security for CES staff which provide for the approval of clients on NSA undertaking only short term vocational courses. This is consistent with the Government's purposes in providing NSA, being that beneficiaries must be unemployed and undertaking activities designed to lead to employment as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The established form of income support for people wishing to pursue courses of full-time study, as opposed to short term entry-level vocational courses, is AUSTUDY. AUSTUDY is intended primarily to assist students to complete their secondary education and to obtain an initial post-secondary qualification.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">FTA is the Government's income support mechanism payable to disadvantaged clients to undertake a range of DEET labour market programs which provide vocationally oriented skills in short term courses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CES guidelines are designed to assist staff in their application of the Social Security Act and are intended to ensure that only appropriate vocational training (not full-time education as such) is approved under NSA, so that course approval does not cut across existing AUSTUDY and FTA policy. The guidelines also ensure that decisions to approve any courses being undertaken while on NSA are consistent with the Government's purposes in providing income support for educational purposes (AUSTUDY/ABSTUDY and Formal Training Allowance (FTA)).</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an integral component of the proposed mine development the Australian contractor, White Industries, prepared an environmental management plan as part of its Technical Feasibility Study Report in 1987. This outlined the methods by which the required environmental safeguards for pollution management and land rehabilitation would be incorporated into the proposed mining, coal handling and coal preparation operations. The White Industries plan was incorporated in the formal environmental management plan prepared by the Central Mine Planning and Design Institute (CMPDI&mdash;a subsidiary of Coal India Limited), which also covered socio-economic factors (especially displacement of people) as well as environmental monitoring and budget allocations for environmental management and rehabilitation and compensation for displaced persons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government of India has advised that the relevant subcommittees of the Environment Department have assessed the plan against the requirements of the Environment (Protection) Act 1986 and recommended it for approval.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CMPDI is monitoring the implementation of the Environmental Management Plan. The Indian Government has advised us that the project is proceeding in accordance with the environmental management plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) AIDAB's Interim Policy Statement on Ecologically Sustainable Development recognises that development requires greater energy supplies and that in the short-term most countries in the Asia-Pacific region must be expected to increase their use of fossil fuels to meet increasing energy demands. In these circumstances, the introduction of efficient mining technologies with a high level of attention to environmental protection and rehabilitation is considered critical.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">India is a large developing country with approximately 250 million people living in abject poverty. The World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and other international development agencies all share the Government of India's view that access to adequate supplies of energy will be a key factor during the Eighth Development Plan period (1992&mdash;1997). Without adequate supplies of energy it will be very difficult for India to lift its standard of living.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, India does not have access to large indigenous supplies of oil. In fact, India's current economic crisis is to a significant degree a result of the need to import oil to meet the needs of industry. India is therefore determined to develop fully its coal resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">India's existing coal mines are generally inefficient and highly polluting. India therefore stands to benefit greatly from the Piparwar project which will introduce Australian open-cut coal mining technology. This will significantly improve India's capacity to develop its coal resources with the least possible damage to the environment. The Piparwar mine is, in fact, the first mine in the Karanpura coal fields to incorporate built-in anti-pollution and environment management systems which are compatible with accepted international standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Protracted negotiations with local villagers have been carried out to negotiate the possession of land required for the project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Progress on land acquisition and resettlement of displaced persons is being closely monitored including through discussions with all relevant parties. The most recent AIDAB monitoring visit indicated that there is a willingness on the part of village communities to shift to new sites and cooperate with the project. However, outstanding issues which remain to be resolved include compensation and land classification. Given the obvious complexities of the situation there is good progress towards resolution of these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Five villages are within the project area boundary. Three of these five villages are within the area of mining operations and infrastructure and the approximately 460 families within these villages will need to be progressively relocated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government of India's compensation program for families displaced by the mine provides for alternative house sites with suitable infrastructural amenities (roads, water supply, electricity, wells and drains), a lump sum grant towards housing costs and a relocation allowance. 300 unskilled or semi-skilled employment opportunities created by the project are reserved for members of families which have been displaced by the mine.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) According to the most recent information obtained by the Australian Embassy in Cairo, which is accredited to Sudan, Pastor Mattaboush was being detained in prison in El Obeid although there are unconfirmed reports that he has since been transferred to Koba prison in Khartoum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Our missions in Africa have actively sought information from a variety of sources on the circumstances of Pastor Mattaboush's incarceration and his present welfare. Despite this, they have so far been unable to ascertain any information additional to that mentioned above, nor of the situation of the four Sudanese People's Liberation Army guerillas referred to in the question. Amnesty International Australia has confirmed that Pastor Mattaboush had been sentenced for allegedly harbouring a member of an armed opposition group but has no further information on his present situation. The Australian Embassy in Cairo has noted in the context of this case that over the past twelve months Christian leaders in Sudan have come under intense scrutiny from Sudanese security for speaking out against the Government of Sudan's appalling human rights record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The Australian Government has made representations to the Government of Sudan, through the Australian Embassy in Cairo, seeking information on Pastor Mattaboush's case and his welfare. The Government of Sudan has not responded to these representations. The Australian Government is deeply concerned at the deteriorating human rights situation in Sudan. We have made a number of representations to the Government of Sudan, in particular concerning the grave human rights situation in Juba. We have also been active multilaterally in trying to ensure that the international community is fully seized of the situation. At the 47th General Assembly of the United Nations in New York the Third Committee has adopted a strong resolution, co-sponsored by Australia, which among other things calls for the Commission of Human Rights to consider at its next session (CHR 49) the appointment of a Special Rapporteur to examine the  human rights situation in Sudan. This result reflects growing international concern about the human rights situation in Sudan and places further international pressure on Sudan to improve its human rights record.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) As indicated in the answer to Question on Notice No. 2379, both the Australian and the NZ Governments recognised in the 1992 Review of CER that aspects of the tax arrangements being discussed were unprecedented and would have wide-ranging implications, including in relation to fiscal sovereignty, revenue and broader international tax policy objectives. In view of these considerations, it was acknowledged that further steps could not be taken until both Governments had conducted the careful and thorough analysis necessary to decide the best outcome. This analysis is in progress. Once it is completed, the Australian Government will consider whether negotiations should commence; depending on the outcome of this consideration it will endorse a negotiating position and, in consultation with the NZ Government, decide when negotiations could commence. It is not possible to say in advance how long the negotiations will take.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The answer to this question would depend on the considerations mentioned in (1) above and on the course of any negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Any new trans-Tasman taxation arrangement would not be implemented retrospectively. Standard practice for the implementation of Double Taxation Agreements is for the agreement to take effect at the beginning of the financial year subsequent to the calendar year in which notes are exchanged between the treaty partners advising that all necessary constitutional and legislative processes have been completed for the agreement to enter into force in the respective countries. Deviation from this practice is not likely.</PARA>
