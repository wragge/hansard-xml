<PARA>This is the Committee's second and final report on telephone recorded message services. It is a follow-up report to the interim report I tabled on 12 December 1991. Since then the Committee has taken more evidence and, in particular, held hearings on 30 April and 6 May 1992 at which AOTC-Telecom and the Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC) were questioned on progress towards implementing the recommendations made by the Committee in its interim report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee was established on 21 June as a result of concerns expressed by a number of honourable senators about the absence from the Telecommunications Bill 1991, agreed to by the Senate on 17 June 1991, of any provision to regulate the content of telecommunications services. Furthermore, there was considerable disquiet in the community about the content of material carried on Telecom's 0055 service, particularly as to the suitability of the material being available in the family home where it could be accessed by children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee was pleased that AOTC, the Government and the telephone recorded message service industry generally had responded, mainly positively, to the recommendations of the December 1991 interim report. We anticipate that negotiations between AOTC and OFLC will soon result in a contract under which the Office of Film and Literature Classification will act as the monitoring and enforcement body for content and advertising standards for the telephone message service industry. This is the key element in the set of measures recommended in the December 1991 report. The new OFLC arbitration mechanism needs to be put in place to give the standards recommended by the Committee detailed meaning and effect when it comes to interpreting them in individual cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee is also gratified by the positive response from the industry. The industry has taken action to remove from 0055 lines as from 12 May 1992 all so-called `adult' and other services provided by its members which did not meet the Committee's standards, which were the original standards of Telecom. The industry also responded promptly and positively to the issue that arose in recent weeks in regard to television advertising of children's competitions available on 0055 services. Cases have been alleged of children being lured by television advertisements into running up large telephone bills by engaging in 0055 competitions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fortunately, the industry, including the Australian Association of National Advertisers and other relevant organisations, took prompt action in response to community concern in drawing up advertising guidelines for such advertisements which were more stringent and more appropriate to children. The Committee anticipates that the action being taken by the industry on this issue, together with the Committee's own recommendations relating to disputed bills for telephone message services, will prevent abuses occurring in the advertising of 0055 children's competitions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recommendations in the report I am tabling today are intended to expedite the process of putting in place an appropriate regulatory framework for the telephone recorded message service industry. They cover:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">codes of conduct for the message standards and the advertising standards for both the 0055 open access recorded message service and the 0051 closed access service;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 gives effect to proposed changes in the areas of telephone concessions, Job Search Allowance and Newstart Allowance, social security agreements with other countries, debt recovery, the income and assets test, compensation payments and data-matching. The Bill also provides for a number of minor and technical amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1991 Budget the Government announced that from 1 July 1992 a new payment, known as telephone allowance, would replace the telephone rental concession voucher scheme. The new allowance will be more "user friendly" in that under the old concession scheme vouchers were sometimes misplaced or lost and pensioners were put to the inconvenience of obtaining replacements. It will also be much simpler to administer. The telephone allowance will be a payment of $51.80 per household each year. A lower rate of $25.90 per year will be paid where the person  commenced to receive pension or benefit after 12 March 1992 and the person's partner is not getting a social security payment. It will be paid in quarterly  instalments to pensioners who are permanently blind or who satisfy fringe benefit means tests and who are telephone subscribers. It will also be payable to certain social security beneficiaries aged 60 or over who are telephone subscribers and to certain other recipients of Commonwealth fringe benefits. The allowance will be indexed annually in line with CPI increases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year the Government introduced a series of measures directed at young people under 18 years of age. One measure extended qualification for Job Search Allowance and Sickness Allowance to 15 year olds who meet the requirements for those allowances (apart from age), who are above the minimum school leaving age or have a formal exemption from attending school, who have an employment history and who are not living with or being supported by a parent. This Bill will provide that 15 year old Job Search Allowance or Sickness Allowance recipients who are in substitute care, often referred to as foster care, will also be paid the higher "independent" rate of allowance. This measure will align the rate of Job Search Allowance and Sickness Allowance for 15 year olds with the rate for 16 to 17 year olds in substitute care. It will further improve the overall level of income support to families who do not receive a substitute care allowance from a State or Territory authority and will encourage the substitute care of young people who may otherwise be at risk of homelessness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill will assist sole parents receiving Job Search Allowance, Newstart Allowance or Sickness Allowance whose only child is under 16 years and in employment. From the day of Royal Assent,  the allowance will be paid at the higher maximum basic rate that is currently payable to a sole parent pensioner.

As a consequence of this measure, an assuror who is willing and able to comply with his or her obligations under an assurance of support will not incur a debt to the Commonwealth. It is inappropriate for assurees who enter Australia on the understanding that they will be supported by an assuror to refuse (without good reason) to accept support which the assuror is willing and able to provide.

However, the units in the other trust will be taken to be a new investment and will be subject to ongoing assessment.

Most importantly the Bill makes explicit that data-matching results can be used to increase the assistance a person receives from the Commonwealth. Up to now the legislative emphasis in that program has been on use of results to reduce assistance. Implementation of the Data-Matching Act has also demonstrated the need for minor amendments.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SOCIAL SECURITY (FAMILY PAYMENT) AMENDMENT BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Social Security (Family Payment) Amendment Bill 1992 gives effect to the Government's commitment to integrate family payments for children. The integration of family allowance supplement and additional pension and benefit will result in a program of nearly two billion dollars which will assist about 800,000 families or nearly one and a half million children.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As well, family allowance and family allowance supplement will be amalgamated into a single payment with entitlement calculated under a two-step income and assets test.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under current arrangements, family allowance is payable to a one-child family with a combined income of $64,167 per annum and full rate family allowance supplement is payable where combined income is $20,700 or less. Both are subject to an assets test based on net market value; $359,250 for family allowance supplement and $600,000 for family allowance with special provisions available for families with high net assets in hardship.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The total number of families assisted under the whole family payment program will be in the vicinity of 1.9 million, or nearly 4 million children.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new payment will be payable at two levels: a basic rate equivalent to the current family allowance and a higher rate, called "additional family payment" in the Bill, equivalent to the current rates of family allowance supplement and additional pension and benefit, as well as rent assistance and guardian allowance if payable. The new payment and arrangements will commence from 1 January next year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present, paydays for family payments and payments for children in the pensions and benefits systems fall on different days in a fortnight. To ensure that the transition to the new family payment paydays does not result in loss, everyone who might otherwise miss out on payment for some days in the cross-over period, or as a result of the cross-over, will receive a one-off payment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new family payment is a major reform which derives from the Social Security Review. It will reduce poverty traps, improve work incentives for low income families, increase the take-up rate of the family payment for low income families with children and help families to budget better. I will deal with each of those improvements in turn.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Poverty traps occur where recipients of income support perceive that they have little financial incentive for increasing income from earnings. In a period when unemployment is higher than we would all like, it is critically important to do everything we can to encourage work force participation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently, pensioners and beneficiaries may compare their financial situation while receiving social security with employment at a relatively low wage or salary and, because they are unaware of their likely qualification for family allowance supplement to top up their earnings, think that they will be no better off if they take work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measures in this Bill will make the choices between Government assistance and work much clearer and will signal to pensioners and beneficiaries that assistance for their families will, in all likelihood, continue if they take a job with a low to moderate wage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When a person leaves income support he or she, if income support was received for 12 months or more, will automatically be sent a family payment claim form and will be given six weeks within which to claim the payment. Shorter term recipients will also be told how to get extra payments. This will give people every opportunity to test themselves for eligibility for the additional family payment. If they lodge their claim within the 6 weeks, full arrears of additional family payment will be made back to the time they ceased their pension, benefit or allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One major effect of these reforms is that the new family payment will direct a greater proportion of the family's social security support to the person responsible for the day to day care of children, usually the mother. For example, in a family with 2 children under 13 where the father receives job search allowance, under the new family payment arrangements the mother will receive $163 a fortnight instead of the $41.40 she currently receives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Family allowance supplement payments are now directed to the mother in most cases, as are the payments of additional pension for children of pensioner couples. The changes in this Bill will apply the same principle to child-related payments for families receiving job search allowance or other income support payments. Directing payments for children to the primary care giver is consistent with the Government's Social Justice Strategy and the National Agenda for Women.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The family payment will be paid on what are currently family allowance paydays. These fortnightly paydays fall on the alternative Thursday to pension paydays. Spreading pensioner's payments more evenly through a fortnight will assist family budgeting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To give another example, a sole parent pensioner with 2 children under 13 currently receives $461.60 each fortnight on the Thursday pension payday and $41.40 in family allowance in the following week giving total assistance of $503 per fortnight.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the new payment structure, after 1 January 1993, a sole parent in the same situation will receive $311.30 in the pension week and $191.70 in the following family payment week, again, with a total of $503 per fortnight.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rent assistance will also be included in the family payment for those families with children, eligible for additional family payment, who pay private rent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I must stress that total financial support provided to the family from social security will not be reduced under the changes to payment arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present sole parents who receive family allowance supplement do not receive guardian allowance, whereas sole parent pensioners do. Under the new family payment this anomaly will be addressed and all sole parents who qualify for additional family payment will receive the guardian allowance. At the moment, guardian allowance is $746.20 a year (or $28.70 a fortnight). Paying guardian allowance to eligible working sole parents will deal with a potential poverty trap for this group.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Maintenance income is currently taken into account in determining the rate of pension or benefit. Under the new arrangements, maintenance payments will only be taken into account in determining the rate of the additional family payment. If the level of maintenance is such that no additional family payment is payable, the excess maintenance will not then be counted to reduce pension or benefit entitlements nor the basic family payment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Family allowance supplement recipients are currently not subject to the maintenance income test. However, from 1 January 1993 all persons qualified for additional family payment will have maintenance taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although this means that some recipients will receive a lower rate of additional family payment, it will result in a more consistent treatment of people in receipt of maintenance. As I mentioned earlier, guardian allowance will be paid to all sole parent additional family payment recipients, and the additional $746.20 a year will largely offset the impact of the maintenance income test for a substantial group.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of the package included in this Bill it has been decided to continue the family payment until a student leaves secondary school or until the end of the year in which he or she turns 18, whichever is the earlier.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This measure encourages families to allow their children to complete education and overcomes an existing anomaly whereby some families receive family allowance for children aged under 18 throughout year 12 while others with children who turn 18 at some time during the year cease eligibility at that time. As at present, students aged 16 years or more will not attract the payment if they are eligible for AUSTUDY.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To improve take up of the new family payment, tax file number data-matching will be used to detect clients who may be eligible for, but are not receiving, additional family payments. FAS is currently assisting over 200,000 families, and it is estimated that a substantial number of additional families will be identified as having an entitlement to an additional family payment. I remind senators that such payments are free of income tax.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The increase in the FAS threshold from April 1992 together with the introduction of the new single two-step program is estimated to lead to an additional 90,000 families receiving additional family payments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The changes being introduced in this Bill require major changes to the ADP systems used by the Department of Social Security. Such major reforms are feasible only because the Social Security computer system is as advanced as any in the world. The changes will also require extensive training of staff and publicity and information material for Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I mentioned the assets test earlier. Senators will recall that, from the beginning of 1992, this Government introduced a hardship test as part of each assets test applicable to family allowance and family allowance supplement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the prevailing economic circumstances, especially the rural downturn, there are concerns about the welfare of children in families with assets above the family allowance supplement assets test threshold, but where those assets are returning very low incomes. Senators will be pleased that the new family payment system preserves the hardship tests for both the basic and additional family payments to protect the families concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill I am presenting to the Senate today is not the end of improvements to this Government's policies to provide assistance for families. It is the end of a rationalisation process that has taken a great deal of work to formulate and put into practice. Our commitment to Australian families is undiminished and this Bill is another clear signal to the families of Australia that their interests will be both protected and, where possible, enhanced by this Government. Above all this Bill brings about a level of consistency in the administration of family payments hitherto absent from the system. I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">changes to the assessment rules for unlisted property trust investments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This last amendment arises from similar changes to Social Security legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The extension of benefits in respect of service in Cambodia follows the Government's decision of 9 October 1991 to deploy Australian Defence Force personnel for service in Cambodia as part of the United Nations peacekeeping efforts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will designate Cambodia as an operational area from 20 October 1991. This is the date, confirmed by the Department of Defence, on which Australian Defence Force personnel were deployed for service in the area. It will remain an "operational area" until the United Nations ceasefire takes effect, and related demobilisation and cantonment measures are in place. After that time, service in Cambodia will be designated as "peacekeeping service".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both periods of service provide entitlement to compensation in respect of incapacity or death based on the more generous standard of proof. The Bill will also extend eligibility for service pension for the period Cambodia is designated an "operational area".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A further amendment to the legislation will be necessary to close off the period of operational service in Cambodia. Administrative arrangements will also need to be made to provide eligibility for benefits in respect of peacekeeping service in the area. These changes will take place after the United Nations ceasefire.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In case there are any concerns, in the light of reports that the Department of Defence may call on some Army Reservists to serve in Cambodia, I specifically make the point that this bill ensures they will be entitled to the same benefits as those available to full time members of the Regular Defence Forces.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In line with the Government's announcement in the 1991 Budget, this Bill will provide for the existing telephone rental voucher system to be replaced with a telephone allowance. This change will be effective from 1 July 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will also provide for the payment of a special telephone allowance for World War I veterans and mariners. This allowance will equal the annual telephone rental charge for a single telephone service, paid in four instalments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Changes to the rules for assessing income in respect of certain investments in unlisted property trusts are also proposed in this Bill. The proposed amendments give effect to the Government's decision of 25 November 1991. A more generous income assessment will apply as a part of the restructuring of the unlisted property trust investment industry. These amendments also reflect similar changes made to the Social Security Act earlier in these sittings.</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">streamlining of administrative provisions to provide for a more efficient and effective delivery of benefits for veterans.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill proposes a number of amendments to the Veterans' Entitlements Act and the Defence Service Homes Act which fit within this category. In relation to Defence Service Homes, the Bill will provide that certain persons, who revoked their entitlement to benefits under the Defence Service Homes Act in favour of benefits under the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Act, will be able to withdraw their revocation and regain entitlement under the Defence Service Homes Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other proposed changes to the Defence Service Homes Act are:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">provision for all financial transactions in relation to the Defence Service Homes Insurance activities under the Act, or in respect of insurance as an agent for an insurer, to be conducted under the Defence Service Homes Insurance Trust Account;</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">provision for certain persons who were discharged on medical grounds, or who die, prior to completing the minimum six year period of service. This change will ensure that such persons, or their dependants, can establish their full entitlements under the Act; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">clarification of the "portability" provisions. This change follows my announcement on 22 August last year that two or more persons, both of whom are eligible for assistance under the Defence Service Homes Act, may "pool" their entitlements on the same property.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One other significant change is the proposed amendments to the Veterans' Entitlements and Seamen's War Pensions And Allowances Acts to allow for the automatic grant of war widows or widowers pension and payment of funeral benefits in certain circumstances. This change will streamline current administrative arrangements and result in improved service delivery.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Changes of an administrative nature are also proposed in respect of the dismissal of applications to the Veterans' Review Board. The changes are designed to clarify current provisions for dismissal of an application for review where the matter has not been finalised within two years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The remaining measures in the Bill relate to changes which flow from amendments to the Social Security Act. This will ensure consistency in the application and administration of the income and assets tests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the Bill contains a range of minor technical and drafting amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All the measures contained in this Bill have minimal financial impact with the exception of the provisions relating to the telephone allowance. The estimated program costs for telephone allowance are $12.060m in 1992-93, $11.307m in 1993-94 and $11.401m in 1994-95.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill and the accompanying levy Bill, will set the framework for the Commonwealth's dairy marketing arrangements until the year 2000 and will have a substantial influence on the future direction of the Australian dairy industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this Bill is to set the rate of assistance for manufactured dairy exports each year up until 30 June 2000, to provide for the termination of Commonwealth underwriting for dairy exports from 30 June 1992 and to provide more flexibility in the way promotion and other industry funds can be expended.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the Australian dairy industry is one of our great traditional primary industries. Over the years it has experienced good times and there have been bad times. The past few years in particular have been difficult, especially for the export sector, but as always the industry has shown great resilience and is adjusting well to meet the new marketing challenges. The package of measures that I will outline today will better equip the industry to handle those challenges. It is the Government's response to the Industry Commission's September 1991 Report on the Australian Dairy Industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The details of the announcements go to both assistance and market development. It is proposed that there be a moratorium for a further 12 months on any reduction in market support. This is particularly to assist the situation in Victoria and Tasmania, where farmers have been hard hit. There will be a phase-down in market support to the year 2000 in equal instalments, taking the market support equivalent protection from 22 per cent above export parity to 10 per cent above export parity. I should point out that this 10 per cent above export parity is the equivalent of and is consistent with the tariff target of 5 per cent for manufacturing industry. Importantly, it is a figure that has been achieved with the agreement of the industry. It is not a figure that was advocated by the IC, which the Opposition was locked into. Underwriting has been abolished, but the cheese tariff quota remains. The `comfort clause' has been abolished and there will be a further review and reorientation of structures to give this industry a more effective market development orientation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, let us have a closer look at the dairy industry. There are just under 15,000 registered dairy farms in Australia producing about 6,400 million litres of milk per annum worth about $1.7 billion. The industry is labour-intensive, directly employing some 50,000 people and indirectly employing a further 50,000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Victoria is the key dairy State producing about 60 per cent of national milk output. The wholesale value of processed dairy foods is around $4.5 billion&mdash;manufacturers and processors add nearly $3 billion of extra value. Around 30 per cent of milk production is exported as dairy products worth around $700m. East Asia accounts for 67 per cent of Australia's dairy exports. Japan is the largest market, closely followed by the Philippines. Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand sales opportunities are increasing as a result of continuing income growth in South East Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1986, my colleague the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the Hon John Kerin, introduced what became known in the industry as the `Kerin Plan'. The aim was to wean the industry from its reliance on Government assistance and to make it more commercially based and more responsive to market opportunities. There would be few in the industry who would disagree that the `Kerin Plan' has been a great success. The industry is now neither backward nor stagnant. It is adopting state of the art technology and adjustment has been taking place on a continuing basis. Farmers have, for example, been leaving the industry at a rate of 3 per cent per year. Nevertheless, national production has tended to increase slightly. There has been continuous amalgamation of and investment in manufacturing facilities and a shift in emphasis from commodities to the marketing of profitable value added products. Nominal assistance to the export sector has reduced from around 45 per cent in 1986 to the current 22 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The `Kerin Plan' assistance terminates on 30 June this year and the challenge has been to develop a new set of arrangements that would be consistent with the Government's broader industry objectives, maintained the momentum created under the current arrangements and yet recognised that the industry is currently feeling the effects of low world prices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the package I will now detail will achieve all of these objectives. It is the outcome of productive consultations with the industry's leadership and it has a large measure of support within the industry. In its development the Government sought a strategy that capitalises on the technical and marketing achievements resulting from the six years of the Kerin Plan and provides the framework that will enable a more productive, internationally competitive and export focused sector to develop. The process of interaction with industry has enabled the laying of a sound foundation for the industry's position up to and beyond the turn of the century.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me say that the important thing about this outcome is that it reflects the active consultation with the industry. That is the important difference between our approach and the Opposition's in terms of addressing industry development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Praise should be given to the industry which negotiated this package of reforms. The Australian Dairy Industry Council represents both producers as well as processors and therefore is an important body because it involves more than just the grower end of the market. It had to negotiate this in difficult circumstances. Not only did the Council have an IC report which it could not live with&mdash;members of the coalition could because they were committed to introducing it&mdash;but also it had to cope with the disciplines associated with our position in the GATT and a constituency that was arguing for the retention of the status quo. But against that background, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy challenged it to produce a forward looking strategy that would secure the industry and make it grow. The Council responded in positive negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Assistance Program</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Assistance to the export sector will remain at the 1991-92 level of 22 per cent of average export prices throughout 1992-93. This is in recognition of the difficult circumstances currently facing many dairy farmers and will provide some time for the industry to re-group. Thereafter, the rate of assistance will be reduced in equal annual steps to 10 per cent in 1999-2000. This 10 per cent market support rate is consistent with the 5 per cent tariff target for manufacturing industry because of the manner in which dairy market support applies and reasonably reflects the Government's industry objectives as announced in recent policy statements. The new arrangements will `sunset' on 30 June 2000. The industry's leadership accepts that the dairy industry should expect no further legislative support beyond the year 2000 and that it will be treated the same as other industries at that time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In keeping with current Government policy, Government underwriting of dairy export returns will terminate on 30 June 1992. Underwriting has been of limited assistance to the dairy industry as it was not triggered until 1990-91 when SMP and casein received $22m in support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cheese tariff quota will be renewed from 1 July 1992. My colleague, the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs, will be introducing shortly the necessary alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1987 by way of a Customs Tariff Proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new arrangements will have no direct impact on the State market milk schemes. These are a State responsibility and continue to provide the major portion of the measured assistance to the dairy industry. Most States have in place, or are planning, significant deregulation post the farm gate. This is a commendable objective which may lead to significant changes. The Government welcomes the current moves for a more uniform national approach to UHT milk pricing. The possible inclusion of enhanced farm gate pricing regulation (the so called section 38 type provisions) will remain a controversial issue and my only comment on this aspect is that States may find it prudent not to be locked into any new farm gate pricing regulation which does not offer scope for flexibility to deal with changing market conditions. Developments in State market milk arrangements will be kept under review in the Agricultural Council of Australia and New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As an added discipline on the States, the Government has decided to terminate the so called `comfort clause' from 30 June 1992.  This provision has provided a connection between the Commonwealth arrangements and the State schemes. This enabled any State to seek suspension of the all milk levy and so discourage inter-State milk trade.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Market Development Program</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The `Kerin Plan' was aimed primarily at raising the farm gate return for manufacturing milk. It also involved the removal of the long-standing practice of equalising domestic and export product returns. The changes exposed dairy manufacturers more directly to market forces. Consequently, a more efficient manufacturing sector has evolved through technology transfer and infrastructure rationalisation. Nevertheless, dairy manufacturers are still some way from achieving their potential in both a well developed marketing ethos and operating practices. The Government has therefore decided to add a second element to the new marketing arrangements to encourage further development in these areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The impetus for change will come from a redirection of the operation of the Australian Dairy Corporation and to a lesser extent, the Dairy Research and Development Corporation to further enhance the industry's export marketing and market development, particularly for profitable higher value products. The Government will be working closely with the Australian Dairy Industry Council and with the Corporations in the coming months to put in place specific activity that will assist dairy manufacturers in the general area of market development. This Bill makes provision for more flexibility in the use of industry promotion funds and the Dairy Industry Fund in market development activity to provide additional funds to support and reinforce the industry's marketing efforts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian Dairy Industry Council</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Council has a legislated role under the current arrangements in respect of a range of policy issues. This is an unusual status for an industry based body and is different from the current representational model based on statutory `industry councils'. Nevertheless, the Council has operated responsibly in its administration of the `Kerin Plan' and the Government has decided to continue that role in relation to the new arrangements. On the other hand, the Council is industry based and cannot avoid an `agri-political' role. This Bill provides for Ministerial scrutiny of the funding of the Council to ensure that funds available for its policy role are not used for other purposes. This process will ensure the contribution of the Council to industry policy development remains under review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the package I have just detailed will provide an industry arrangement that is transparent, predictable and progressive. It highlights the benefits of consulting with industry and it underscores that this outcome for the industry could not have been achieved by the coalition, because it is locked into `Fightback' which proposes the elimination of tariffs and the adoption of the IC report. There is no flexibility in the Opposition's position at all, and that is why the National Party, in particular, has found itself in such great difficulties within its own constituency. On the other hand this Government has taken a reasonable approach given the industry's current situation and  the desirability of further assistance reductions. It will take the industry to the end of the decade and leave it in good shape to face the future thereafter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to honourable senators and present the Explanatory Memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DAIRY PRODUCE LEVY (No. 1) AMENDMENT BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Dairy Produce Levy (No. 1) Act 1986 to complete the measures that will set the framework for the Commonwealth's dairy marketing arrangements that I have outlined in the Second Reading Speech on the Dairy Produce Amendment Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill extends to 30 June 2000, the imposition of the market support levy which provides funds for the market support payments on manufactured dairy exports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also repeals section 6 of the Principal Act which is known in the industry as the `comfort clause'. The provision allows for any State to seek suspension of the market support levy through the processes of the Australian Agricultural Council (now known as the Agricultural Council of Australia and New Zealand). Its effect has been to enable any State to discourage interstate trade in market milk. The Government accepts the industry's view that this levy suspension provision has outlived its usefulness.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the Bill increases the maximum rate of levy collected for dairy promotion from 5.5c to 8.0c per kg butterfat to allow for increased promotion activity by the Australian Dairy Corporation. The Government will be working closely with industry to put in place activity that will assist dairy manufacturers in the general area of market development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The increase in the maximum rate of levy is supported by the Australian Dairy Industry Council. The actual operative rate of levy, which is currently 4.65c per kg butterfat is prescribed by Regulation. Recommendations of the Council are required to be taken into account in prescribing any new rate of levy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to honourable senators and present the Explanatory Memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">HEALTH, HOUSING AND COMMUNITY SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill makes amendments to a number of Acts within the Health, Housing and Community Services Portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 2 of this Bill makes a number of amendments to the Disability Services Act 1986. The amendments to Part II of this Act are part of a new strategy to assist Commonwealth funded organisations improve the standard of service they provide for people with a disability. The primary focus of the amendments is on providing people with the services which best meet their needs and aspirations, and to ensure that the quality of these services is subject to safeguards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Disability Services Act came into operation in 1987. It provided all the then funded services (called prescribed services) with five years to meet the higher standards of service embodied in the objects (which are contained in section 3 of the Act), and principles and objectives (made under section 5 of the Act, and Gazetted on 9 June 1987). This five year period ends on 30 June 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although significant achievements have been made, it has become clear that for many services this five year period was not long enough to deal with the complexity of the changes required. Therefore, the Bill provides for ongoing funding to prescribed services so that they can complete the necessary changes enabling them to further the objects of the Act, and the Gazetted principles and objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To be assured of ongoing funding, services will have to meet prescribed minimum standards. The minimum standards were introduced administratively in February 1991 and all services are expected to meet these standards by 30 June 1992. Ultimately, all funded organisations will be required to become eligible for funding under section 10 of the Act, by providing a service at a standard consistent with the objects of the Act, and the Gazetted principles and objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, to give recognition and assistance to those organisations who are continually and substantially improving their services, but who have not reached the standard for eligibility for funding under section 10, the Bill establishes an intermediate level of service standard and attainment. To reflect their progress and transition on the path to higher service standards, these services will be called transitional services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill provides for the Minister to determine clear and objective standards, which services will be expected to meet. Where a service fails to meet the applicable standards the Minister will be able to take actions under the terms and conditions contained in the funding agreement; however, this action will be subject to a review by a Disability Standards Review Panel. The amendments provide that the performance of funded services against the applicable standards is assessed at least once every 5 years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department is currently consulting with a wide cross section of the community about setting appropriate standards, the processes for monitoring service performance, and the operation of the review panels.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also contains provisions relating to the transfer of services under the Commonwealth/State Disability Agreement signed by all Heads of Government on 30 July 1991. The Agreement marks a turning point in the provision of more efficient, and better, services for people with a disability in Australia, by rationalising the responsibilities of each level of government, and by ensuring co-ordinated service delivery. The Bill contains provisions to allow State and Territory Government employment services which are transferring to the Commonwealth, but which are not yet furthering the objects of the Act, or the Gazetted principles and objectives, to be funded as prescribed services under section 13.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill removes the restriction on funding of for-profit organisations. This will allow the Minister to fund, on a case-by-case basis, services which are provided by other than non-profit organisations; for example, some attendant care services for which there is currently no option but to fund outside the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also provides for some other minor and technical amendments to Part II of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the objects of the Disability Services Act  clarify that the Disability Services Program and the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service are assistance programs that operate within budget constraints.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With respect to the amendments to Part III of the Disability Services Act the amendments clarify that the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service (CRS) does not have liability for payments under the Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS) for pensioners and beneficiaries whose rehabilitation programs involve tertiary training. As is the case for other Australian students, it is appropriate that students with disabilities should meet these costs when their income exceeds the HECS liability threshold.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other minor amendments to Part III of the Act would achieve an increase in the operational flexibility of the CRS by: providing legislative support for the reasonable termination of CRS programs; deleting and/or replacing outdated references to goods, services and Social Security allowances; clarifying eligibility for free services; and allowing administrative arrangements to be put in place with other Commonwealth entities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 3 of the Bill makes a number of amendments to the First Home Owners Act 1983. The First Home Owners Act was amended in 1990, as part of the Government's data-matching program, to insert a provision requiring current and new beneficiaries under the Act to provide their Tax File Number (TFN) data within 60 days of its request. Failure to comply results in termination of all future monthly payments of assistance, an unintended and unduly harsh penalty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recipients of assistance under other Government programs covered by the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990, who respond late, can resume their entitlement simply upon reapplication after furnishing the requisite TFN data, with the penalty only of those benefit payments lost in the interim. However, the option of a fresh application is not available to First Home beneficiaries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new subsection 17C to be inserted in the First Home Owners Act will allow monthly payments of First Home Owners assistance to be resumed once the applicant supplies the required TFN data, with the penalty only of those payments lost by failure to provide it within the specified period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments in Part 4 of this Bill relate to the provisions of the Health Insurance Act 1973 concerning pathology services and the initiation of excessive diagnostic imaging services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments affecting diagnostic imaging services, are designed to give the Minister the authority to refer an ordering practitioner, including a medical or a dental practitioner, a chiropractor, a physiotherapist or a podiatrist, to a Medical Services Committee of Inquiry, if the Minister has reasonable grounds to believe that such a practitioner has initiated excessive diagnostic imaging services. Under the existing provisions of the Health Insurance Act a Medical Services Committees of Inquiry can deal with practitioners who render excessive professional services, but does not enable excessive ordering to be considered.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current legislation enables the Minister to refer medical practitioners who initiate excessive pathology services to Committees of Inquiry under section 23DM of the Health Insurance Act. The amending legislation before the Senate provides for similar provisions to apply to the initiation of excessive diagnostic imaging services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of previous amendments to the Health Insurance Act, from May 1991 and March 1992 chiropractors, physiotherapists and podiatrists have been able to refer patients for certain diagnostic imaging services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amending legislation proposes, therefore, that the definition of "practitioner", in relation to diagnostic imaging services, be amended to include chiropractors, physiotherapists and podiatrists, so that these practitioners may also be subject to examination, on referral by the Minister, by a Committee of Inquiry for the initiation of excessive diagnostic imaging services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This legislation also provides that certain procedures are to be followed before the Minister may refer a practitioner to a Medical Services Committee of Inquiry. Such procedures parallel similar provisions already existing in the Health Insurance Act in relation to pathology services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similarly, Committees of Inquiry will follow the same procedures for the hearing and reporting of cases in relation to the initiation of excessive diagnostic imaging services as they do for other cases brought before such Committees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 5 of the Bill contains amendments to the Hearing Services Act 1991. In response to a Report of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services undertook to amend the Hearing Services Act during this Sittings by omitting paragraph 66(5)(c). The amendment will have the effect of limiting the protection of section 66 to the name National Acoustic Laboratories, the acronym "NAL" and the NAL logo. In addition, subsection 56(5) is to be omitted from the Hearing Services Act, as it is no longer a requirement that the Treasurer tables in the Parliament Commonwealth guarantees of borrowings by the Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 6 of the Bill extends the Safety Net arrangements under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, contained in Part VII of the National Health Act 1953, to include medication supplied through out-patient departments of State public hospitals and Repatriation hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The expenditure by patients on such medication will be able to be recorded by the hospital authority and count towards the threshold for the issue of concession and entitlement cards. The holders of these cards obtain their pharmaceutical benefits for $2.60, or free of charge, respectively.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The hospital authorities will be able to issue the cards to patients.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By agreement with the various State governments, these arrangements are to be retrospective to 1 January 1992. Procedures were put into place for the recording of supplies of out-patient medication from 1 January 1992, and upon passage of this Bill the concession and entitlement cards will be issued to persons who have qualified for them and refunds made where appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The passage of the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Act (No. 2) 1991 created the position of Senior Deputy President of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. A consequential amendment, in Part 6 of this Bill, provides that the Chairperson of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal must be either a Senior Deputy President or Deputy President of the Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 6 of the Bill also provides that in cases of amalgamation of pharmacies, only the pharmacist or pharmacists whose pharmacy or pharmacies will close under the amalgamation agreement, may apply for, and thus receive, the grant of financial assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 7 of this Bill contains several measures aimed at improving the administration of nursing homes under the Aged and Community Care program. The Government has achieved a considerable amount of reform in nursing homes over the last six years, and the measures proposed here build on this achievement. The measures improve both the rigour of the management of nursing homes and the outcomes for the frail, aged residents of nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first measure relates to pre-admission leave. One immediate benefit to nursing home residents of this Bill will be the introduction of pre-admission leave. Nursing home residents already are able to leave the nursing home for up to 28 days a year without any reduction of nursing home benefits paid to the nursing home. In the case of residents having to go to hospital, there is no limit to the number of days leave during which benefits will still be paid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This entitlement to 28 days non-hospital leave is now being extended to allow for up to two days of leave to be taken before the resident actually enters the nursing home.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both the nursing home industry and the public have expressed concern about the existing arrangements, where an elderly person often receives short notice of a permanent vacancy in a nursing home. The person is often expected to take up the place the same day, or risk losing the place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the existing legislation, no Commonwealth benefit is payable until a person occupies a place in a nursing home. The understandable desire of nursing home proprietors to maximise their occupancy can lead to considerable pressure being placed on the aged person to enter a nursing home as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Act will allow new nursing home residents to use up to two days of their existing 28 day entitlement for non-hospital leave, immediately prior to their entering the home. This two day period will enable them to organise their affairs, and prepare for the change of living arrangements, without fear of losing their place in the nursing home. It will also assist people in country areas who may have to travel some distance to the nursing home.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The introduction of pre-admission leave is not meant to be an automatic condition proprietors require of all residents but will be an option available to those who need it. A limit of two days will ensure new residents retain a generous social leave entitlement for the remainder of the financial year to assist them to adjust to long term care.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second measure relates to the disclosure of information to prospective purchasers of nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The nursing home funding system is, in part, a cost reimbursement system. Commonwealth benefits are advanced to proprietors each month and, following the end of each financial year, that advanced benefit is acquitted against the proprietor's actual expenditure on nursing and personal care.  Where a proprietor has spent less on nursing and personal care than has been advanced, the balance is recovered. This is frequently the case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What this means is that it is possible for a proprietor to underspend benefit and sell his or her nursing home before the overpayment can be identified, let alone recovered. Once the home is sold, the Department is able to quantify the overpayment. However, the current legislation makes the new proprietor liable for recovery of the previous proprietor's overadvance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This process is well established and known in the industry, and is usually accounted for in contracts for sale of nursing homes. However, the secrecy provisions of the National Health Act 1953 prevent the disclosure by the Department of information relating to a nursing home to a prospective purchaser. While prospective purchasers may appreciate the possibility of a recovery subsequent to sale, without specific information as to current and impending recoveries, they may be unable to adequately make provision in the contract of sale. They may, as a consequence, be significantly disadvantaged by underestimating the amount of the recovery.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This may place some strain on the home's financing, making it harder for the new proprietor to provide quality care to the residents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill contains amendments to assist in protecting the incoming proprietor and ensuring continued quality care for residents by allowing the Department to provide the prospective purchaser with the information he or she needs to make an informed decision about a sale.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rights of existing proprietors are also considered, as the Department will be required to wait 7 days before disclosing information, during which time the proprietor may make a submission on the matter for consideration. In situations where there is an urgent need to act to protect the interests of a prospective purchaser, however, the Department will be able to act immediately.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The elimination of this risk in the purchase of a nursing home will promote confidence in the transaction, stability in financing and continued quality of care for residents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The third measure in this Part of the Bill relates to the keeping of certain records by former proprietors of nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A further consequence of proprietors being able to sell their homes before an overpayment can be quantified is that, if the Department is unable to gain access to the proprietor's accounting records, it will be very difficult to quantify the overpayment accurately. While nursing home proprietors are subject to a number of statutory responsibilities in relation to the keeping of records, those responsibilities presently cease once the proprietor has sold his or her home.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment in relation to this matter will help to protect taxpayers' money by introducing a requirement for former proprietors to continue to maintain their records for 12 months after they have sold their business. The amendment also enables the Department to approve a specific location for the keeping of the records, and provides appropriate penalties for former proprietors who fail to maintain their records accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fourth measure introduces amendments in relation to receivers, liquidators, etc. who are appointed to run a nursing home.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill amends the secrecy provision contained in the National Health Act 1953 to clarify the Department's ability to divulge key information to persons appointed to manage a proprietor's approved nursing home. Historically, there have been practical problems about how the secrecy provision should be administered where, for example, a receiver or a liquidator is appointed to conduct a proprietor's nursing home business. This has limited the Department's ability to deal effectively and co-operatively with such appointees, thus making it difficult for the Department to act in the interests of the nursing home residents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The final measure in Part 7 of the Bill relates to transfers of nursing home bed approvals under section 39B of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill contains a measure to protect residents, where approved beds are to be transferred from one home to another. Approval-in-principle for such a transfer will be subject to a condition that the proprietor of the home yielding the beds continues to comply with nursing home conditions of approval. This is to further protect the welfare and safety of the residents in that home which will close or be reduced in size.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will also provide for the formulation of principles to be referred to in making decisions to grant or refuse  approvals-in-principle for transfers. These principles will address such matters as fraud or the provision of false or misleading information, failure to meet gazetted nursing home standards, and problems with any other statutory requirements. The effect will be that, where a person does not have a satisfactory record in the provision of aged care, that person will not be able to expand his or her interests in the industry by buying and transferring nursing home beds. This is a further example of the Government's commitment to ensuring quality care for the frail aged.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 8 of the Bill introduces amendments to the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989. These amendments clarify the definition of `therapeutic devices' for the purposes of that Act and implement, in the time suggested, further recommendations made by Professor Peter Baume for improving Australia's regulatory regime for therapeutic goods. These recommendations are contained in Professor Baume's "Report on the Future of Drug Evaluation in Australia", tabled in Parliament in July 1991, and adopted for implementation as a package by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment to the definition of `therapeutic device' in the Act will strengthen the regulation of therapeutic goods used to replace or modify the human anatomy for cosmetic purposes, such as breast implants. The amendment will also serve to permit greater scrutiny by the Therapeutic Goods Administration of therapeutic goods used to influence conception, including goods used in the IVF program. These changes also serve to bring the definition of `therapeutic devices' closer to that being used by the countries of the European Community, from which a significant proportion of therapeutic devices are imported into Australia. The new definition will accommodate emerging technologies being developed in the fields of immunology, genetic engineering and computer software.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The remaining amendments largely give effect to the recommendations contained in Professor Baume's Report. During the last Sittings, amendments to the Therapeutic Goods Act were introduced to enable deadlines to be set for completing evaluations of certain therapeutic drugs. The Bill inserts a provision, as recommended by Professor Baume, to enable applicants to treat a failure by the Therapeutic Goods Administration to meet the stipulated deadline as a decision to refuse marketing approval for the applicant's drug, for the purposes of precipitating a direct appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also contains new reporting requirements designed to ensure that, for the protection of consumers and the public, any adverse safety data relating to certain drugs that have been approved for marketing, or that are the subject of an application for such an approval, will be reported by the relevant sponsors or applicants where they become aware of such information.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to attract suitable candidates to assume the challenging responsibility for initiating recommended changes and improvements to the regulatory regime for therapeutic goods in Australia, Professor Baume recommended, in Chapter 12 of his Report, that the position of both National Manager and Director of Drug Evaluation in the Therapeutic Goods Administration be filled on a contract basis. To enable such officers to exercise relevant powers under the Therapeutic Goods Act and Regulations, the Bill introduces amendments that will allow regulations to be made to permit the Secretary and the Minister to delegate their powers and functions to officers who have not been appointed to the Therapeutic Goods Administration as public servants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the Bill facilitates Professor Baume's recommendation that the deliberations of the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee and its subcommittees be more widely disseminated. It permits the making of regulations authorising the release of therapeutic goods information to the public.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now turn to the amendments to the Health Insurance Act relating to the repeal of the Medicare Co-payment arrangements, contained primarily in Schedule 2 of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments will operate retrospectively from 1 March 1992. Provision has been made, however, for the preservation of the effect of the benefit reduction, co-payment and "additional fee" for those prescribed services rendered during the period 1 December 1991 to 29 February 1992. Provision has also been made for the preservation of transitional arrangements for the medicare safety-net as it is affected by the change for individuals from a financial to a calendar year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Health Insurance Act is amended so as to remove the enabling provisions for the Health Insurance Regulations to prescribe services which would have a reduced level of medicare benefits, and where these services are bulk billed and provided to non-cardholders, a co-payment and an additional fee. The Health Insurance Regulations have already been amended so that no services have been prescribed under these provisions since 1 March 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Specifically, the Bill withdraws the provisions which enabled a reduction to the benefit for out-of-hospital general practitioner attendance items by $3.50 and eliminates the further reduction that was to apply to medicare benefits for prescribed services in the following year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It also withdraws the provisions which permit medical practitioners to charge up to a $2.50 co-payment for those prescribed services which are bulk-billed and provided to non-cardholders, and the payment of the $1.00 additional fee to the doctor in respect of these services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From 1 January 1992, registered families have been counting their out of pocket medical expenses or "gap" payments towards a safety-net threshold of $246.00 per annum.  A "gap" payment is the difference between the lower of the Schedule fee or whatever the doctor charges, and the medicare benefit. The extension of the medicare safety net arrangements to families remains unchanged by these amendments to the Health Insurance Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Bill removes the provisions relating to the safety-net concession card and the need for a declaration form. These are not necessary as there is no longer a co-payment for bulk billed services and therefore families and individuals do not have to provide evidence to their general practitioner that they have reached the threshold in order to be exempt from the co-payment. The safety net status of an individual or a family need only be known by that person or family and the Health Insurance Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The withdrawal of these provisions does not affect the overall intent of the 1991 Budget announcement relative to general practice. This Government is committed to working with the medical profession to achieve structural changes in general practice, which are aimed at achieving better quality care at better value for money. The Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services will be making more specific announcements on these measures in the coming months.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1992, which is now before the Chamber, contains a number of amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1987. Many of the amendments have already been introduced as customs tariff proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule One is operative from the first day of July 1990 and subtracts the customs duty component from the New Zealand rate of duty for tobacco products of chapter 24. The amendment is made in the context of Australia's obligations under the 1988 closer economic relations protocol.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedules Two, Three and Four contain amendments to concessional items in Schedule 4 of the principal Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule Two, which will operate from the first day of January 1991, amends item 41a. This will allow motor vehicle component manufacturers to directly use import credits which they earn under the motor vehicle export facilitation scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule Three will have effect from the twelfth day of March 1991. Item 56 will allow certain capital equipment which is technologically more advanced, more efficient or more productive than equipment available from Australian manufacture to be imported duty free.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule Four will take effect from the first day of October 1991. The provisions of Item 31 have been expanded to allow all aircraft parts, materials and test equipment for use in the manufacture, repair and maintenance of aircraft to be imported duty free. The only exceptions are goods which are used for servicing aircraft. This affirms the Government's objective to develop and maintain the international competitiveness of Australia's aerospace manufacturing and aviation industries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sunset clause has been removed from Item 36b which allows certain chemicals to be imported duty free for specific end-uses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Item 57 has been created to allow certain chemicals and textile fabric to be imported duty free when used in the chemicals, plastics, and book binding and allied industries. This action will also assist the international competitiveness of these industries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Item 58 has been inserted to allow general purpose components and materials for use in the manufacture or repair of invalid carriages to be imported duty free.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule Five is operative from the first day of January 1992. Schedule 1 of the principal Act has been amended to give effect to changes in the concessional tariff treatment accorded goods from Yugoslavia and its republics under the Australian system of tariff preferences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Changes to Schedule 3 of the principal Act involve the treatment of motor vehicles. The definitions of off-road and passenger motor vehicles in additional notes 4 and 5 to chapter 87 have been amended. The upper weight limit for light commercial vehicles has been raised from 2.72 Tonnes to 3.5 Tonnes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Item 40g is inserted in Schedule 4 to cover those textile orthopaedic goods excluded from heading 9021 by sub-note 1(b) to that chapter. This item will retain a free rate of duty for these goods.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule Six operates from the first day of March 1992. These amendments:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Contain further changes to the tariff treatment of goods from Yugoslavia and its republics;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Are made in the context of the post-1988 assistance arrangements for the textiles, clothing and footwear industries and insert new quota tender and tender extension duty rates for tcf goods from the first of March 1992 to the twenty-eighth of February 1993. This  follows the determination of rates under the 1992 tender quota scheme;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Increase the footwear priceline for seven subheadings in chapter 64 and one sub-item in Schedule 5;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Reword item 40g in Schedule 4 to allow only those textile orthopaedic goods which are excluded from chapter 90 by sub-note 1(b) to that chapter to be imported duty free; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Alter Item 57 in schedule 4 by expanding the range of raw materials and intermediate goods available as duty free inputs for the chemicals, plastics, and book binding and allied industries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule Seven will commence on the first day of April 1992 and clarifies the intent of note 4(e) to chapter 87 by ensuring that clearance levels for off-road vehicles applies to front and rear axles as well as to the suspension.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule Eight will operate from the first day of July 1992. The duty on cold-rolled, and clad, plated or coated flat-rolled steel products of tariff headings 7209, 7210, 7211 and 7212 will be reduced from ten per cent to five per cent. This represents, for the specified products, an acceleration of the phasing down of general tariffs announced in the 1991 industry statement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The tariff rates for goods from Hong Kong, Republic of Korea, Singapore and Taiwan Province will be maintained at five per cent in line with measures announced in the industry statement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As previously announced, in relation to high volume imports of used or secondhand passenger motor vehicles, the Government has decided to impose a duty of $12 000 per vehicle in addition to the duty already in place. This action will protect the Australian motor vehicle industry from low cost imports of secondhand vehicles particularly from Japan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A new Item 59 in Schedule 4 of the principal Act will ensure that the existing provisions for personal or low volume importations of used or secondhand vehicles will remain unchanged.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A new tariff structure is provided for short pack bicycles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule Nine will have effect fourteen days after this Bill receives royal assent. It inserts new additional notes to Section 16 and to chapter 84, to clarify the intent of the customs co-operation council in relation to the classification of certain goods.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Also contained in the Bill are a number of minor technical and administrative changes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Summaries of the amendments contained in this Bill have been prepared and are being circulated for the information of honourable Senators.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CUSTOMS LEGISLATION (TARIFF CONCESSIONS AND ANTI-DUMPING) AMENDMENT BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill is an omnibus measure proposing a series of amendments to the Customs Act 1901, the Anti-Dumping Authority Act 1988, and the Customs Tariff (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act 1987 to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1)repeal Part XVA of the Customs Act 1901 and substitute a new Part XVA of the Customs Act 1901 to give legislative effect to the Government's response to the Industry Commission's report on the Tariff Concessions System (Report No. 9 of 8 March 1991), announced by the Government on 24 September 1991; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2)amend Part XVB of the Customs Act 1901 and the Anti-Dumping Authority Act 1988 to give legislative effect to the Government's review of Australia's anti-dumping and countervailing system, announced by the Government on 5 December 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now briefly outline the proposed changes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tariff Concessions</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present Commercial Tariff Concession System allows duty free entry of imports where there are no goods serving similar functions made by Australian industry in the normal course of business. The objective of the system is to ensure that industry is not taxed by the Tariff where it is serving no protective function. By lowering input costs, the concession system is an important element in the Government's program to improve the international competitiveness of Australian industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once a Commercial Tariff Concession Order is in place, any importer can use it to import goods described in that order duty free.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present Commercial Tariff Concession System was introduced in 1983, following an IAC report in 1982. The March 1991 Industry Commission inquiry and report to which this Bill is addressed has been prompted by a growing dissatisfaction with the operation of the current system, particularly with the time taken to obtain a concession order, and the lack of transparency in the decision making process leading to the grant or refusal of such an order.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments proposed in this Bill reflect the Government's decision to accept most of the Industry Commission's recommendations for changes to the Commercial Tariff Concession System. They will make concessional entry more readily available without affecting the assistance given to industry and improve the openness, clarity and consistency of the tariff concession system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, Clause 10 of the Bill introduces a new Tariff Concession System by repealing the old Part XVA of the Customs Act and substituting a new Part XVA. The four principal elements of the new system are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the first introduces new definitions for the current core criteria for the granting of a tariff concession order to replace the old "goods serving similar functions" test, which incorporated the economic concept of "cross-elasticity of demand", which has proven difficult to interpret and administer,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the second introduces strict time limits both on the processing of applications or revocations by the bureaucracy, and on the submission of information by affected parties. This will streamline the consideration of applications for tariff concession orders or revocations of such orders, and help make the process more transparent,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the third introduces limited and definitive grounds for the revocation of tariff concession orders, to improve accountability and address concerns amongst users of tariff concessions about possible arbitrary revocations,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the fourth introduces a right to merits review of all decisions made in the new Part XVA, first through an internal review mechanism, and then via the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to this final principal reform, it is noted that the current Concession System allows persons aggrieved by a decision under Part XVA to obtain judicial review of that decision under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. This is both costly and time consuming, and importantly, limited to errors of law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed new two tiered process of Internal Review/AAT Review is a merits review process which will allow for review of a decision on the facts, together with a substitution of decisions in appropriate cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other more technical amendments relevant to the new Tariff Concession System contained in the Bill are explained in detail in the Explanatory Memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anti-Dumping</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed anti-dumping amendments in this Bill follow the Government's review of Australia's anti-dumping policy and administrative arrangements in late 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dumping and subsidisation are not supported internationally if they cause, or threaten to cause, material injury to an industry producing like goods in the importing country. The internationally agreed remedy is the imposition of a dumping or countervailing duty sufficient to remove the injury to the local industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has consistently maintained that effective anti-dumping and countervailing measures are necessary to protect Australian industry from injury caused by these unfair trading practices. However, in taking anti-dumping and countervailing actions there is need to strike a balance. A balance between providing local producers with effective relief, and ensuring that relief does not unjustifiably impede trade or increase costs to Australian consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anti-dumping decisions therefore require judgments to be made involving a blend of economic and commercial considerations. Over the last two years the Government has particularly focused on the time taken to process applications for anti-dumping and countervailing action. The Government looked exhaustively at the options for reducing the time between a request for anti-dumping relief and the time when such relief can first be made available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1991 March Industry Statement the Government proposed and the Parliament subsequently passed legislation which greatly reduced the processing time for applications. Clause 13 of this Bill will further shorten the total time allowed to reach a preliminary finding to a maximum of one hundred and twenty five days, or for complex cases, a maximum of 145 days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This compares more than favourably to the times taken by other countries in the processing of requests for anti-dumping relief. Australia now has one of the fastest anti-dumping systems. The USA for instance, takes between 160 and 210 days; Canada between 141 to 186 days, and the European Community around 270 days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I incorporate into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> a comparative table of these time limits, for the information of honourable members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The table read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">[THE TABLE IS OMITTED FROM THE DATA BASE, SEE HARD COPY PAGE 2861]</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To keep processing time for anti-dumping relief to a minimum, the Government also considers it appropriate that the applicant for that relief provide sufficient information to enable a prima facie case to be established. The technical requirements of applications have therefore been tightened by clauses 12 and 13 of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I draw to Honourable Members attention that the Business Liaison Unit or Shopfront of Customs has been expanded to continue its important role in assisting Australian industry to complete the form for anti-dumping applications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has also recognised industry's dissatisfaction about the relatively short period, that is 3 years, that anti-dumping and countervailing measures are in place. In recognition of this and also to remain consistent with amendments proposed to the GATT in the Uruguay Round, Clause 17 of the Bill provides for anti-dumping and countervailing measures to be extended to five years. In addition to this extension, Clause 7 then provides for a review to be undertaken by the Anti-Dumping Authority as to whether measures should continue after the five year expiry date for measures or undertakings, following a request for such a review by an interested party. The Authority will call for submissions no later than eight months before this expiry date so as to allow sufficient time for a comprehensive inquiry to be made by the Authority&mdash;and a decision to be made by the Minister&mdash;before the end of the five year period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Measures will be retained where the Minister is satisfied that they are required&mdash;but they may not necessarily be of the same type or magnitude. For example, if earlier measures were in the form of an undertaking, they might, depending on the circumstances, be replaced by anti-dumping duties. Similarly, earlier measures based on prices in the country of export may need to be revised to reflect prices which are more current.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This reform is considered by the Government to be preferable to requiring an Australian industry to re-apply for anti-dumping or countervailing relief, with the possibility of a gap occurring in the important relief which might be available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, with regard to the substantive anti-dumping amendments contained in this Bill, the Government is proposing in Clause 8 the extension of the life of the Anti-Dumping Authority for a further 8 years to August 2001. During the course of its review, the Government considered claims of duplication of work by the Customs Service and the ADA, but it is satisfied the current division of responsibilities between these two bodies should be retained, to ensure the comprehensive and impartial review of anti-dumping measures that is currently provided by the Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In proposing the substantive anti-dumping amendments which I have briefly detailed, together with the several technical amendments to the anti-dumping system which are explained in detail in Clauses 11 to 16 of the Explanatory Memorandum, the Government does recognise the important part which imports play in our economy and reiterates that it will not see the anti-dumping system used as de facto industry protection. However, the Government believes Australian industry will welcome the changes which this Bill proposes to make to the anti-dumping system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The message is clear. The Government will not allow material injury to local industry from dumped or subsidised goods. The Government has backed up that commitment with an anti-dumping system that is one of the fastest in the world, which recognises the need for applications to substantiate a case, and which provides appropriate assistance to all parties and is fair in its judgements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The financial impact of the measures contained in this Bill relating to anti-dumping and tariff concessions involve new staffing costs to process the various applications for measures within the stricter time constraints, to expand the Business Liaison Unit within the Australian Customs Service to assist with dumping applications, and to meet the new merits review reform in the tariff concessions area. In addition, new notice requirements in provisions of the Bill relating to the tariff concessions reforms will involve increased printing costs.

<PARA>By agreement, Mr President, I understand, my colleague Senator Crichton-Browne and I have both bound ourselves to 10 minutes, so it might be of assistance if we start the clock. I am very pleased to see this report tabled in this place today. I think it makes a nice sequel to the drugs in sport inquiry. Before I make some comments about the report, I would like to take the opportunity to thank my colleagues and to thank the staff, including the Secretary, Mr Grundy, for his assistance with this report. I would also like to thank those many staff who have been listed in the report as assisting us, particularly Dr Anne-Gabrielle Thompson, Derek Drinkwater, Angela Misic, Laurie Swift, Kathy Casey and others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report has taken some time. Indeed, the Committee report was circulated to members of the Committee in late February but there has been a delay until now to get the finalised report and the accompanying minority report. We wanted the tabling of this report to match when Alec Watson was back in the country and that has meant that we are now seeing this report finally tabled in May. I am appreciative of that now being the event. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This inquiry was a modest inquiry. Before we took this reference, Alex Watson said that he had nothing further to say to what he had said in the drugs in sport inquiry, and in all sorts of places subsequent to that. However, when the terms of reference were taken by the ERA Committee, Mr Watson was pleased to contribute; he provided a submission and he appeared before the Committee. It was an inquiry that was focused in its aim. It was also limited in the number of people who were interested in putting submissions; it was a very specific inquiry about a specific matter. We received four submissions and we had about five witnesses come before us in the hearings that we held. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee wanted to make clear that this was not a continuation of the drugs in sport inquiry and that it was not a rehearing of the Alex Watson appeal. Both of those were important points of consideration and I think they qualified how the Committee tackled its report. As I understand it, the essential difference between the Committee's report and the minority report is the amount of detail that the minority report goes to: in no way did it detract from the Committee report, nor indeed did the Committee report detract from the minority report; there was just a different weighting of how these issues should be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one significant difference in our recommendations. The Committee's report found, as was beyond dispute, that Alex Watson&mdash;as he had said many a time before and has always acknowledged&mdash;was above the prescribed limit for caffeine when he was tested for drugs in the Olympic Games in Seoul. He has never disputed that and that is still not a matter of dispute. In dispute were the points at issue for Mr Watson&mdash;the Committee spells them out on page three of the report&mdash;and he was particularly pleased to be able to put them to the Committee. He said that, if he had gone above the level&mdash;and yes, he had gone above the level&mdash;he had to have done so unintentionally because the only caffeine he could have taken was what was in beverages that he had consumed during the course of a day's performance in Seoul: coffee and Coca-Cola. So he wanted it to be known that he had unintentionally exceeded the limit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, he felt that the IOC, the International Olympic Committee, in making the judgment about him&mdash;or about anybody, for that matter, who had exceeded the prescribed limit&mdash;presumed illegal behaviour, that a person could not have possibly gone above the level without having done something besides drinking coffee or Coca-Cola, that it could not have been inadvertent to have exceeded that limit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, he was concerned that the Australian Olympic Federation, as it was then, had imposed a very inappropriate penalty at the time of Seoul, that it was harsh and peremptory, and that there were no appeal provisions for him. Finally, he was concerned that, in the course of all of this, his reputation and good name were seriously damaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee was concerned to hear from the AOC, the Australian Olympic Committee, as well as from Mr Watson, and we also took evidence from Professor Burkett about the information we could find out from expert witnesses about caffeine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say in summary, particularly given the time constraints today, that the jury is out on caffeine. While the jury is out on caffeine, this Committee comes down with these recommendations, very strongly: if we cannot be clear with any reliability about how caffeine is absorbed into the body or how it is circulated or how it is excreted, if we cannot be sure that we can set an absolute, scientific, valid level that is appropriate for everybody, then we must, until that is the case, proscribe it. My colleague in his minority report concludes differently, and he will no doubt speak to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee judges that the penalty given to Mr Watson for a first offence, that is, the life ban put on by the Australian Olympic Federation at the time, was an excessive penalty. Indeed, it is not hard to agree with that because the AOF itself, subsequently the AOC&mdash;I shall call it the AOC from here on&mdash;concluded that the penalty of a life ban should be reduced to a two-year penalty to be served concurrent with the ban put on by his own pentathlon organisation, to run from the time of his disqualification from the Olympic Games. As everybody knows, Alex Watson has now completed that two-year ban and is currently preparing to represent Australia at these Games. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee felt that that penalty was excessive, and we recommend that in the future penalties for drug offenders should match as much as possible the now recognised&mdash;or somewhat accepted&mdash;standard of three months for an inadvertent use, two years for a first time penalty, and life for subsequent offences. Mr Watson was not given that kind of benefit. Subsequently, on appeal he was, and we feel that that decision by the AOC on appeal corrected the excessive penalty put on at the time of the Olympic Games. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also clear, from questioning and from reading the evidence, that the Australian Olympic Committee at the time in Seoul was clearly very distressed itself by the shock of this happening. Alex Watson's positive drug test was the first for any Olympic athlete from Australia. I think it was not only a shock to Australia and, as we know, to Alex Watson that this should be recorded; but also it was a very big shock to the Australian Olympic team officials. It is without doubt that they were caught on the hop and overreacted in the way they managed the situation in Seoul. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for that reason that the Committee report has been at pains to recommend that, in the future, that not be allowed to happen again, that proper procedures be put in place to ensure that, in particular, the rights of the athlete are protected and provided for. Another athlete at Seoul at the same time was assisted by an advocate in his dealings with a positive drug test. That is now going to be the situation for the Australian team. It was not, until this event, and I think we should take heart from some of those protocols being in place. I believe it is important that natural justice prevail in this area as much as anywhere else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said we were concerned not to continue the drugs in sport inquiry. What has happened in this country is that, because of law and legal behaviour, considerable penalties and considerable loss, particularly of good name and of income, have occurred as people have been tested positive for drug use. Those consequences are very stern, but it is not an area that has a long history of using judicial process. That is something we should look at in the future, to continue to provide not only natural justice but proper justice. I think that the past might have been a learning curve for people involved with drugs in sport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This brief report concludes the matter of the Alex Watson inquiry. It continues this Government's commitment and this Parliament's commitment&mdash;a united commitment&mdash;to oppose drugs in sport as being unfair and of no example or model in this country. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Crowley observes, the minority report is of some length. It is over 100 pages. I have to say, with respect, that that is a modest contribution to the level of detail that ought to have been committed to this report. Let me say from the outset that ultimately there are some significant differences between the findings of the minority report and those of the majority report because in some respects the majority report chose not to make findings. The essential finding made in the minority report is that Watson did breach the allowable IOC urine caffeine concentration levels. The minority report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The IOC Medical Commission was of the belief that Mr Watson did not obtain his urine caffeine concentration levels in the manner he claimed.</PARA>
<PARA>We found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no evidence that Mr Watson reached these levels other than by the manner he claims.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Scientific evidence demonstrates that a urine caffeine concentration level of 12 mcgs/ml can be obtained by the normal consumption of coffee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Scientific evidence demonstrates that Mr Watson could have obtained his urine caffeine concentration level of 14.45 mcgs/ml by the consumption of coffee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Scientific evidence indicates Mr Watson could have reached his urine caffeine concentration level of 14.45 mcgs/ml by consuming the amount of caffeine he claimed.</PARA>
<PARA>In my view, Alex Watson has been treated in the most appalling way by the AOC and the IOC. The AOC has redeemed its sins by subsequently accepting an appeal from Alex Watson and reducing his life penalty to two years. In some ways, the AOC expunges its sin by making the following observation. I quote Mr Gosper:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Board determined that Alex Watson's evidence throughout has been consistent and that it could see no evidence of consumption of caffeine other than by his drinking of coffee.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the AOC found that Alex Watson did not reach his level by the ingestion of caffeine tablets or suppositories; he obtained it by the consumption of coffee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That contrasts sharply with the IOC's findings and the grounds for which it deemed him to have tested positive to a dope test, expelled him from the Twenty-fourth Olympiad, expelled him from the Olympic village, placed him on an aircraft at 5 o'clock in the morning, and sent him home in disgrace to Australia. The IOC concluded that the drug test taken by Mr Alex Watson was positive, given the high level of caffeine, which could not have been due to drinking coffee, even in considerable amounts. This conclusion of the IOC Medical Commission was accepted by the Australian Olympic Federation and the UIPMB&mdash;the International Union of Modern Pentathlon and Biathlon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The IOC Medical Commission consequently recommended to the IOC Executive Board that Mr Alex Watson be disqualified from the Seoul Olympic Games. The IOC Executive Board accepted the recommendation of the IOC Medical Commission. The finding of the IOC was that he had been deemed positive not because he had reached the level of 14.45 but because he could not have reached that level, in the view of the IOC Medical Commission, by the normal consumption of coffee. That has been found by the AOC to have been wrong. It has been found by the minority report, accepting all the available expert evidence of world renowned reputation, that Alex Watson reached his level in the manner he claimed. So Alex Watson was expelled from the Games improperly and by a miscarriage of justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following that, and notwithstanding the most vigorous campaign to clear his name, the IOC has not been prepared to entertain an appeal. Perhaps the greatest sin of the IOC in its cavalier disregard for the rights of Alex Watson and all the athletes is that it does not have an appeal mechanism available. While the IOC preaches fairness, equity, justice and the spirit of goodwill for all athletes of the world, it does not itself have an appeal mechanism which allows athletes whose reputations are destroyed across the world to have a forum in which to claim their innocence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It took our Committee, inquiring for the first time into the basis of the grounds for his expulsion from those Games, to learn that, in fact, Alex Watson had not cheated; that Alex Watson had consumed coffee in the normal way; that Alex Watson had every reason to believe that his consumption of coffee would not take him over the prescribed limit. As Dr Sando, the AOC doctor, said, `If I had known Alex Watson was going to drink 14 cups of coffee over 12 hours, I myself would not have counselled him that he was likely to breach the prescribed limit'. Yet subsequently, when Watson breached the prescribed limit by the normal consumption of coffee&mdash;I say `normal' in the sense that he consumed coffee and did not use a suppository or take tablets&mdash;the AOC promptly found him guilty and banned him for life from competing. The IOC expelled him from the Games and kicked him out of the village. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I regret that I have but 10 minutes this morning to talk on this issue, but I accepted the 10 minutes because, if I had not, the report would not have been tabled. It has taken from 1988 to 1992 for it to be learnt that Alex Watson did not cheat and that the grounds upon which he was expelled from the Games were false. Our findings are buttressed by Dr Birkett, Head of the Department of Clinical Pharmacology at Flinders University and recognised as a leading world authority, whose views are supported by people such as Professor Richard Day, Dr K. Donald and a significant number of other authorities. In fact, Professor Beckett, who is a member of the IOC Medical Commission, supports the proposition that is put by us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I believe that the conduct of the IOC is absolutely reprehensible. I refer those who have an interest in this matter to the 12 letters I wrote to the IOC demanding that it provide the basis and the grounds for the conduct. On each occasion the IOC denied us a response. It was only in the last 24 hours that we received correspondence from it which sets out very clearly that Watson was expelled from the Games because the IOC did not believe he consumed coffee in the manner he claimed. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When we met yesterday I was pointing out the outrageous fact that I had learned that the ALP, which is spending some $80m, I understand, to build its new building&mdash;I wonder where it is getting its money&mdash;is to have as its major tenant the Australian National Audit Office. Perhaps that is where it is getting some of its money. I find it absolutely unacceptable to have an organ of the Parliament, the hugely important National Audit Office, as a tenant of this new building. The Auditor-General is a man who must be independent and who must be seen to be independent. He must be seen to be under no pressure at all. He must be seen not to be in a position where he could be said to be influenced. That certainly is not the case should he be in the Australian National Audit Office.</PARA></TALK.START>

Senator McMullan tried to tell me that it was all DAS's negotiation. We all know that DAS is the organ that does the work, but the client in this case is the Australian National Audit Office, and of course it is the client who gives instructions. Therefore, the relevant people to answer these questions are the officers who actually negotiated those contracts or those leases, whatever they are. So I would ask at this stage whether Senator McMullan has been able to get that documentation, whether he is going to table it for us now, and whether or not he has present the actual officers who negotiated that arrangement. </PARA>

In response to this interest, the Australian Property Group sought expressions from building owners and developers interested in providing between 3000 and 8000 square metres of office accommodation in the Barton-Parkes-Forrest precinct, in order to ascertain what proposals were under consideration and whether they met the Commonwealth's requirements. </PARA>

Indeed, report No.296 of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts on the reform of the Australian National Audit Office recommended that the ANAO plan for a new building within the Parliamentary Triangle or on State Circle adjacent to the new Parliament House. ANAO has a requirement for approximately 6000 square metres of quality accommodation, and the ALP proposal represents the only option large enough to comply with ANAO's requirements. It should be noted that the Liberal Party did not turn up at an appointment to discuss its proposal and has not since made contact. </PARA>

We know that with the ad bans legislation we are not allowed to put paid advertising onto the airwaves, either radio or television, and we are dependent for the interpretation of our message on employees of Labor owned stations. Is it not amazing that they are going to have what is seen as an improper advantage?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now we have a cash flow to the Australian Labor Party from the Government's own coffers. To say it is improper, to say it is an outrage, is to put it mildly. There is a distinction to be drawn between the Australian National Audit Office and other Government departments. One can argue a case for ordinary Government departments choosing accommodation that is suitable to them, but we are going to have the keeper of propriety over the expenditure of money housed in a building owned and operated by the Australian Labor Party. Under the system that works here, I presume it was given the land free, despite the fact that it had another building and sold it to&mdash;guess who?&mdash;the ACTU.

In this case the political party happens to be the Labor Party. I put it to the Parliamentary Secretary that if the political party were the Liberal Party, he would see that there was some problem in relation to a conflict of interest.

Is it within his contemplation, in these days when a tenant can be in a very strong position in setting out a lease, that that might be to the advantage of the tenant rather than the landlord? Does he think that a lease establishes the rules between the landlord and tenant? As has been pointed out, for someone as powerful as the Government, the lease is often made in favour of the tenant. Once the lease has been established, that is really the end of the matter. It is hard to see how a landlord can influence a tenant once the lease is made.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, in my experience, the landlord was rather more enthusiastic than the tenant about the renewal of the lease, and rather more concerned about the commercial consequences of the renewal, for obvious reasons. The interest payments go on. The renewal is, therefore, fundamental to the financial viability of the commercial developer. I do not see the problems, real or perceived. I do not know anything about this lease but, assuming it is a standard government lease, it will have all those protections, as such leases have always done in the past.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a big difference between the positions of a lessor and of a lessee, as Senator McMullan said, when lease renewals come up. Clearly, the tenant is in a strong position then and the lessor is sweating on the fact that he will renew the lease. But that is not an issue that comes to pass with a 15-year lease. Such leases are becoming the norm, rather than the exception, in the major capital cities of Australia. Only a few years ago five-year leases were about the longest term lease one would get. They have become the norm because of the massive incentives that landlords have had to pay. That is not the case in the Canberra office market, which is a very unusual market dominated by government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A tenant paying, as the Parliamentary Secretary has said, a rent&mdash;a gross rental, from what I can understand&mdash;of $1.68m a year for an area of 6,000 square metres is what any property developer anywhere in Australia would consider to be an extremely plumb tenant, a fantastic deal to get hold of. What we have to look at is that that lease is for 15 years, which even in terms of the Perth office market or the Sydney office market&mdash;where we have massive oversupplies&mdash;is an extremely long lease. There are often good reasons for that. But a 15-year lease really is just gold for a developer or a property investor; it is just like solid gold. Having a government tenant on a 15-year lease is like winning lotto. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that scenario, where there is a 15-year lease, the rent reviews become very important and that is where the relationship between the lessor and the lessee becomes important. I think it is important that the Senate be informed as to how often there are rent reviews. I would like this recorded for the benefit of the Senate and for the benefit of the people of Australia. It is the taxpayer who is giving this gift to the ALP. I would also like to know the terms of those rent reviews, whether they are based on the market or whether they are linked to a CPI. Also, is there some sort of cap on those rent reviews? How will they be negotiated and how will they be determined? I think it is an important matter because the lessor with a 15-year lease has the lessee over a barrel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the important political point, the important policy point and the important point of principle is that not only should these sorts of deals be fair and equitable, they must also be seen to be fair and equitable. I think that most people would be horrified to know that the Australian taxpayer will be a captive tenant of the Australian Labor Party for the next 15 years, plus there is a five-year renewal. It does not matter how well worded the lease is or to what extent the whole deal seems to be at arm's length, the concept of a political party, a major Australian political party, being the landlord of a captive government tenant will stink a little. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Western Australia massive construction is being undertaken by the Superannuation Board, flowing from deals that were negotiated through the heady days of the 1980s&mdash;deals that I do not need to go into now because they are well publicised and well understood. Those buildings are basically being paid for, and underwritten, by the taxpayer of Western Australia and they are attracting major government tenants at a time when there are a number of vacancies in buildings constructed by the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, again, the taxpayer is having to bail out the Labor Government in Western Australia because it has entered into silly commercial decisions. In some contexts, the situation in Western Australia can be compared favourably with what is happening here in Canberra with this deal. At least there it was a quasi-government agency, the State Government Insurance Office or the State Government Superannuation Board, ostensibly leasing a commercial building, the Government would argue, at arm's length, to some of the major tenants there. Here the Australian Labor Party is the developer and the owner of the building and the Australian National Audit Office or, in other words, the Australian taxpayer is paying this $1.68m starting rental.

I think the ALP is being stupid for doing it because I think it is inviting a political reaction. In terms of principle, political parties should not lease office space to government departments. I think that is the principle we should stick by. I share Senator Bishop's view that, if the Liberal Party has done it in the past it is wrong; if the Democrats do it, it is wrong; if the Labor Party does it, it is wrong. It is as simple as that. It is a bad principle: it is bad philosophy and bad policy. The Australian Labor Party has made a mistake, and it is a mistake that the Australian people should frown upon. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been raised in some detail, and I have assured Senator Lewis that if there are any documents available relating to that I will make them available. My advice is that the Audit Office initiated the request; and, as the honourable senator would know, it was supported in that by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, which also said that it should be in the Parliamentary Triangle. I think it is quite correct; but irrespective of whether it is correct or not, that was the view it expressed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to some of the points raised by Senator Campbell. He picked up the fact that I had referred only to the renewal situation. I raised that only because it had been explicitly raised with me. It is certainly not the only point in the relationship. I responded to a specific query with regard to the circumstances that arose at renewal. There are, as I am aware, a large number of other points in the relationship. I am also aware that the Commonwealth has a very powerful position as tenant in the ACT and negotiates very favourable rents for itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This principle that political parties should not be landlords is a very new one. For the last 25 years at least political parties, starting with the National Party, have been landlords for the Commonwealth in Canberra. I cannot give the exact date, but it certainly goes back before 1972. I think there probably were some eyebrows raised when it was first done for McEwen House. I am not aware of that but, given that that was the first time, there probably were some queries. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> would indicate that; I do not know. I have to say that there has never been any indication that anything untoward has occurred, nor would I have expected there to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whatever political differences I might have had with the National Party from time to time, it would never have occurred to me that they would use improperly their position as landlord of whichever government bodies have been within their building from time to time. It has certainly never been indicated in all those 25 years or so that anybody has raised the slightest concern that that should be the case. It has never arisen with regard to the Labor Party; and the Liberal Party&mdash;quite reasonably, from my point of view&mdash;has also expressed an interest in supplying such office accommodation to the Government. I do not make that point to embarrass the Liberal Party, because I think that they are perfectly entitled to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Australian public is entitled to know is that these are legitimate commercial operations. Within Canberra, as the honourable senator would know, there are a large number of national organisations, of which political parties are a very small proportion, which develop properties in Canberra as part of the development of the national capital and which lease space in those buildings, not always to government but predominantly to government because it is the largest tenant in the ACT. That has been the case for more than 20 years. It remains the case, and in all that time there has been no concern expressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two separate issues here. One is whether political parties should be landlords to the Commonwealth. The history of that is fairly clear and I do not regard it as even a matter of controversy, let alone difficulty. The second question is whether there is something peculiar and special in the relationship between the Audit Office and the political party. That is Senator Lewis's point, and Senator Bishop has also referred to it. I think that is an argument quite separate and distinct from the primary one that Senator Campbell was referring to. I have expressed my views about it, and I am confident that the independence and integrity of the Audit Office will not be in any way undermined, nor would this Auditor-General or any subsequent one allow it to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just wanted to distinguish the two issues. Senator Short and Senator Campbell were referring to the second, Senator Lewis and Senator Bishop to the first. We need to keep them separate, although they are both properly before us. </PARA>

It is the linchpin between accountability for the expenditure of government funds and accountability of those funds to the Parliament.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bishop emphasised that nowhere is far from anywhere in Canberra, and compared to Sydney and Melbourne it is certainly true.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to the National Audit Office, we have got a specific request from the Parliament&mdash;from the Joint Committee of Public Accounts&mdash;that it should be in the Parliamentary Triangle. I think it is in a somewhat different position from many of those others who, in my view, should not be in the Parliamentary Triangle; and I have expressed that view to them. Some of them already are. It is probably sensible that the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet should be, but for the Industries Commission, the Australian Taxation Office and the others I do not think it is anywhere near so significant. I share some of the implied concern that Senator Bishop raises, but I do not think it relates to the Audit Office. It has a special relationship to the Parliament and the Parliament has asked that that be reflected in its geographic location. So it is only appropriate that that should take place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The answer to the question with regard to dispute provisions and rent review provisions will be, I assume, in the rental documents which I am seeking from the Minister. Senator Short remarked that it is not for me to say that I am seeking them. To that I will just say, as I said to Senator Bishop, that I cannot give guarantees. It is not within my power to give them. It is no good my saying yes, I will present them. They are not my documents. I am seeking them. I have asked the Minister to provide them. It is no good my saying yes, I will do X, because I cannot guarantee to do it. I am trying to do that and I am telling the Senate that which it is in my power to do. I cannot do other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notwithstanding the fairly shonky arithmetic that came out from Senator Bishop, it is nevertheless a lot of money we are talking about. Anybody who heard or read the outline that has been given might think that this was a net benefit of some very large amount going to the Australian Labor Party. Yet anybody who has the slightest knowledge of the commercial situation in Australia, now or at any time, would realise that that is a gross figure against which a very large amount of costs have to be borne. I have been involved as landlord on behalf of a property owner for many, many years. In several of those circumstances but not all, the tenants were government tenants. Some of them were private sector or trade union and interest groups, other professional bodies, et cetera. There is a vast difference between a large cash flow of rental income and a large profit. In many of the instances the buildings were in their early years. I think that most buildings in their early years, because of repayment requirements on borrowings and start-up costs, make a loss. If that were not the case, the situation for many of our business people who invested significantly in commercial property and those financial institutions which supported them would be vastly different from that which we find ourselves in today. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been asking for these things now for something like three years; and still we have not seen the legislation, still we have no commitment on the parliamentary audit committee, and still we have no commitment on the question of whether or not the Auditor-General becomes a statutory authority so that he has more independence and is seen to be above other departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Somewhere in here there might be a word about the desirability of having the Audit Office in the Parliamentary Triangle in a new building because its accommodation in the previous building was thought not to be satisfactory. But we sure as hell did not say that it ought to become the tenant of the sleazy ALP. We did not say that the Australian Labor Party ought to be in a position to be the landlord of the Australian National Audit Office; and to try to say that the whole justification for this rental is based on a recommendation of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts is to mislead this Parliament in a way which is simply not acceptable. But I should not be surprised: the Labor Party is very good at it; it has had lots of practice recently. </PARA>

As I said to Senator Short, and I thought it was a valid point, a lot of people want to be in the Parliamentary Triangle. I disagree with most of them being here, and have said so and will continue to do so. But the Audit Office has a special relationship with the Parliament which, as I am advised, was reflected in the recommendation of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. If that is the case it seems reasonable, but we would probably have made the same decision, that it is a body that should be in the triangle, were it not a recommendation of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, because it seems like a good idea.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we should be kicking a lot of people out of the triangle&mdash;but not the Audit Office.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before Senator Bishop formally moves that this matter be deferred until the required material is available, a move which of course I totally support, I just want to ask a couple of questions of Senator McMullan, both in his capacity as handling this and also bearing in mind his position as Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer and therefore being directly associated with one of the two key departments with responsibility for the proper management of the finances of the Commonwealth, namely, the Treasury and the Department of Finance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I preface the question I am going to ask by pointing out that, as well as handling the Bills before the Committee today, Senator McMullan is also the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer and therefore has a direct interest in one of the two departments, the other one being the Department of Finance, that have the greatest responsibility for the protection and management of the public purse. The Department of Finance really is the custodian of the public purse, along with the Audit Office. They each play a unique role and have a unique importance, therefore, in the proper management of government, especially financial administration. I link the Treasury in with that as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I want to know from Senator McMullan is whether the Department of Finance or the Minister for Finance was consulted in relation to the proposed move by the Audit Office into this new Labor Party owned building.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Department of Finance was involved in the usual way, which is that there is a requirement for budgetary consideration of any extra rental cost incurred. This would be for any instrumentality, not just for one within the Department of Finance. Before it could agree to enter into such a contract, it would have to have the approval of the Department of Finance to commit the Commonwealth to spending the money. So, to that extent, in the normal way, the Department of Finance would have been aware of the arrangement overall, but the question of who owned the building was not a factor that the Department of Finance would have been involved with. That is a matter fundamentally for the Australian Property Group, which negotiates leases on behalf of the Commonwealth. To the best of my knowledge, the Minister for Finance was not informed, and in the normal course of events he would not be, with regard to such matters as the entering into of rental agreements and the negotiation of such commercial contracts. As I am advised, it is not a matter usually drawn to the attention of the Minister and it was not on this occasion.</PARA></TALK.START>

We have advised the Opposition, all the other parties and independent senators that the Commonwealth needs the Appropriation Bills passed today, and it will be an extremely serious matter if, with regard to this, a decision is made by the Senate that might in some way obstruct the capacity of the Senate to pass this Appropriation Bill today and therefore lead to problems in the provision of the necessary financial resources to different arms of the Government to maintain their operations. </PARA>

There is no question of my seeking by that to back away from my intention to provide all the documents that I have undertaken to provide and to press the Minister for Finance to provide those others which are not in my power to provide but which I wish him to provide. I am seeking to avoid that, but I make the point firmly that it is a serious matter that honourable senators opposite are proposing and I think we need to keep the nature of the issue and the nature of the response in some sense of proportion.

It is incumbent on the Government to let the Senate have the views of the Minister for Finance and his Department on that matter. I am amazed that no such view has apparently been sought or expressed at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bishop will no doubt wish to comment on this as well, but I refer to the Minister's remarks about the seriousness of the matter that the Opposition, through Senator Bishop, is proposing. The Opposition is proposing to defer further consideration of this until the necessary documents are provided to enable the Senate to take an eyes-open view on these matters. It is very serious to propose that this Senate should pass Appropriation Bills on important and sensitive issues, issues that go right to the propriety of government, without the Senate being provided with the necessary information to be able to take a fully considered judgment. That is where the seriousness of the matter really lies. Senator McMullan is trying to shoehorn appropriations through the Senate&mdash;and through the Parliament&mdash;including matters about which there are, at this stage, the gravest questions of propriety going to the whole core of decency. </PARA>

There is no awareness&mdash;this is subject to confirmation&mdash;on the Department's part that major difficulties would be experienced if these Bills were not passed until early next week. So before that claim is made, I think it should be checked out and the Senate advised of the basis for the honourable senator's assertion. Otherwise, one will just automatically get&mdash;rightly&mdash;the impression that honourable senators opposite are trying, as I say, to shoehorn this thing through.

There are a whole lot of things that need to be answered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just so we understand what we are really talking about, I have drawn attention to the fact that I consider the ALP to be specifically unsuitable as a landlord for the Australian National Audit Office. I have said that there is adequate evidence on the record as to why that is so. However, I also made the point right at the beginning that I do not care which political party it is; the Australian National Audit Office ought not to be a tenant of any political party. The Australian National Audit Office has to be above suspicion, like Caesar's wife, Calpurnia. It is not above suspicion to have the Australian National Audit Office in the building owned, operated and, I presume, occupied by the Australian Labor Party or any other political party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said that I drew a particular distinction between the Australian National Audit Office and any other organ or department of government. There is an arguable case that the rule should apply across the board, but today we are not discussing any other agency or organ of government: we are discussing very specifically the Australian National Audit Office. I said that I was going to take a look at the report of the Public Accounts Committee entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Auditor-General: Ally of the People and Parliament.</EMPHASIS> The last recommendation in that report is recommendation 78, which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Audit Office plan for a new building&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I stress: a new building&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">either within the Parliamentary Triangle or on State Circle adjacent to the new Parliament House, and that the building be called Audit House.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Public Accounts Committee did not recommend that the Australian National Audit Office become a tenant, whether of the Australian Labor Party or anybody else. It said that the Australian National Audit Office should be granted its own building, to be called Audit House, to draw attention to the fact that the Auditor-General is just what our report says he is&mdash;the ally of the people and the Parliament. It is through the Auditor-General, to the Parliament, to the people, that the accountability for the expenditure of taxpayers' money is made available. This arrangement between the Labor Party and the Australian National Audit Office, through whoever has done the negotiations, is simply not acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am going to move that we defer this matter until we have received an answer to the six questions I asked Senator McMullan but, more particularly, until we sight at least this so-called agreement to lease and see what conditions remain to be fulfilled and what penalty would be incurred if that agreement were broken. I think the Committee is entitled to sight that because the Committee ought to make a decision as to whether or not this agreement to lease should be broken and any penalty paid. This matter is of great importance. This is an agreement covering 15 years, with an option for a further five years, with a refurbishment of the building at the end of 10 years; and then there will be an agreement to exercise the option. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are very serious issues. Yes, in the course of this debate colourful phrases have perhaps been used. But I would have thought that, at the end of the day, those people on the other side, those people who agree that the question of the integrity of Parliament is the most important question here, would agree that it is not possible for the Australian National Audit Office to be a tenant of the Australian Labor Party. Bear in mind that the Public Accounts Committee referred to `a building of its own called Audit House'. This briefing paper, which I suppose is what Senator McMullan tabled and which is called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Provision of Office Accommodation for the Australian National Audit Office, Barton</EMPHASIS>, simply does not meet, either in spirit or in word, the recommendation of the Public Accounts Committee.

<PARA>So let us get that precedent fairly clear before we go to the point of the absurdity of the proposition that a contract between John Curtin House Pty Ltd and the Australian Government involves a pecuniary interest for members of the Labor Party, beyond that of any other company which donates to a political party.

The situation is that the only way a member of the Labor Party, a candidate for election or whatever&mdash;other than directors who have an interest, though not a pecuniary interest, because they are not paid as such&mdash;could be said to have a pecuniary interest would be if John Curtin House Pty Ltd sought to donate to the Labor Party for the election campaign, as it does from time to time and which it discloses; as do many other companies which donate to both parties.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier today I gave notice of a motion concerning what I regard as a very negligent breach of ministerial responsibility. Every school in Australia has been sent, at taxpayers' expense, a kit on World Environment Day. I believe that it involves some 50,000 kits, and they were sent to 12,000 schools right around Australia. The intention was that they be used to celebrate World Environment Day on 5 June and that teachers use the material in the kits to stimulate discussion and increase students' knowledge of environmental issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not yet had time to read all the papers but I have read some, which is more than I can say for the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories, Mrs Ros Kelly. Mrs Kelly was forced to admit, after the shadow Minister for primary industry, Mr Bruce Lloyd, and the shadow Minister for sustainable development and the environment, Mr Fred Chaney, brought it to her attention, that something she had endorsed she had not even bothered to read. That is an indictment of any Minister in this Parliament, and especially in the Government at the moment, where so many Ministers are forgetting to read anything about some of the little memos that are going around the place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other senators might have seen Mrs Kelly featured on television a few nights ago. It highlighted her success, her toughness and her rising stature. She is billed as one of the Labor Party's stars&mdash;I suggest a falling star. It is a pity Mrs Kelly does not spend a little more time on her portfolio and a little less time on her personal image and her ambitions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mrs Kelly endorsed this kit and accepted an invitation to launch it today without even having read it. Mrs Kelly's excuse is that it is not her fault, it is her Department's fault. Is this the latest Labor Party excuse line? We have heard Senator Richardson admitting that he did not know what his staff had received. We have had Senator Evans tell us he does not know what his Department or senior advisers are up to. Now it is Mrs Kelly's turn. She does not say `Mea culpa'; she says, `Blame it on the Department'. No doubt she will also in time take the Evans option and blame one or other of her staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On reading the ministerial list, I noticed that Mrs Kelly has no fewer than 14 people on her ministerial staff. Included in that list are seven advisers, two consultants and one departmental liaison officer. Yet despite all those people, despite the fact that this kit could not have been written and produced overnight, despite the fact that Mrs Kelly had personally endorsed the kit and had accepted an invitation to launch it, she admits on the morning of the launch that she has not read it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where does ministerial competence and responsibility start and where does it finish? Just what was it that she did endorse but did not read? Let me turn first to the page about biodiversity. This leaflet suggests:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The earth's biodiversity is under threat&mdash;mainly from land clearing for agriculture, such as intensive, single crop agriculture. In developing countries, this generally means producing cash crops for western consumers as a way of paying off debts.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no mention in these papers of what the cities do to the species range or of the pollution caused by cities and their residents' cars, gardens and indiscriminate use of water. We are told that it is all the fault of the farmers. I am trying to stand up for the farmers in this place because the Government has spent the last eight or nine years kicking them in the guts, and I do not think that is fair for the farmers of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me move on to the leaflet on land management. Here we are told:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The earth's fertile land is disappearing at an alarming rate as forests are cut down and cash crops and modern farming methods destroy the soil. . . Until about 50 years ago, most farms were `mixed'. The average farmer produced small amounts of many different crops&mdash;perhaps growing wheat, barley, potatoes and other vegetables, and running cows, pigs, ducks and hens.</PARA>
<PARA>I might add that the diagram here shows a typical English farm. It does not show a typical Australian farm. The leaflet goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Farming practices today are very different. Farmers are often specialists&mdash;growing enormous amounts of just one or two types of crop. Artificial fertilisers and herbicides are used to produce the biggest crop possible&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I hope we do try to grow the biggest crop possible, to help with our balance of payments situation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At first glance, this style of farming seems like a huge step forward. . . But the environmental costs of these farming practices are high, and loss of fertility, soil erosion and land degradation have occurred in many places.</PARA>
<PARA>She suggests that the diagram I have just mentioned be used to discuss farming practices in class. She tells the students that that is what is done. On that little diagram it says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Constant use of fertiliser reduces the soil's health and structure, while increasing acidity.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Eroded fields.</PARA>
<PARA>If that is not trying to indoctrinate a new generation, I do not know what it is. We have been told that the Minister did not see this and did not even know about it. But someone in the Department must have, and should have brought it to her knowledge. They should have known that it was inaccurate, divisive, and bound to give a whole generation of children an anti-farmer bias. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where is the departmental responsibility? Is it the intention of that Department, and indeed of the whole of the Australian Labor Party, to give farmers a kick everywhere and anywhere they can? Giving a $20 billion industry a kick, I believe, is treasonable. It is an attack on agriculture generally. I do not think that anyone in the community should take much more notice of the Minister because of the way she has behaved in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not the first time this sort of propaganda about farmers has been circulated, and the chances are that it will happen again, but I believe it is about time it stopped. The Minister's apologies and the duckshoving on radio this morning are not good enough. I think every kit ought to be withdrawn from the schools immediately and replaced with more accurate information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all very well to say, `I have made a mistake'. That is a little like making somebody pregnant and then saying, `Well, I have made a mistake. We will change it all again'. But you cannot change it all again. The Minister's suggestion that a letter be sent to each school advising that she will not endorse it will not be worth a tinker's cuss to the people out in the community. The Minister needs to be reprimanded. She also needs to be reminded that with the perks of office come a lot of responsibility. As she is the Minister, the buck stops completely with Mrs Kelly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that Senator Crane is going to say a lot more on this. He will obviously give the Western Australian perspective to it. But I believe that it is an indictment of the Government, and it is an indictment of the Minister that she has put out this blatantly incorrect propaganda, which she has now admitted is incorrect. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you. This is indeed a tragic occasion not just for farmers but for the Australian community. It is particularly damaging for the political processes that have been developed in this country over the past 10 or 15 years in tackling the problems that have occurred&mdash;and nobody will deny that&mdash;in understanding what happens in terms of the farming process. The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories, Mrs Kelly, put out a pamphlet which is nothing less than blatant left wing communist propaganda. Senator Coates can laugh; I hope he has seen it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even in this little thing about land management there are the words `down on the farm'. There is a very succinct message in that. The propaganda written on that is a total misrepresentation of the situation that exists in Australia today. It should also be rejected by the Government because it flies in the face of the Government's own Landcare program; it flies in the face of its support of the national soil conservation program; it flies in the face of the things that the various State governments have done on soil conservation since 1982. After a series of meetings, the States made amendments to various soil conservation Acts. I was heavily involved in that because it was in Western Australia that the first soil conservation Act was changed to allow certain things to happen in terms of land management and land care and the development of different skills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of managing our land, managing salinity, managing wind erosion, managing minimum tillage and a host of other new ways of operating in the farm sector, things have changed dramatically. This flies in the face of the previous Prime Minister's launching of his own landcare program, but I shall come to that in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to the propaganda that has been put before us today in terms of the environment. It suggests that schools hold a special assembly on World Environment Day and invite an environmentalist or an Aboriginal elder to be the speaker. What is wrong with inviting the head of the division of resource management in the State? What is wrong with inviting some of the farmers who have carried out conservation programs and changed their farming practices? What is wrong with inviting some of the officers of the forestry departments who have been involved in on-farm plantations? What is wrong with involving some of the scientists from the agriculture departments who have been developing methods for controlling water run-off, salinity, wind erosion and a number of other things? They are people who actually know what is happening on the ground, people who will give a balanced position on these things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Minister's announcement today she admitted that she had not seen the material. That seems to be a habit of Ministers of this Government in recent times. They have not seen the material, or they sign letters when they do not know what is in them, or they sign references for people when they really have no idea who those people are or what they are about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister says that she will not now launch the pamphlet. Why can the Minister not also announce that she is going to withdraw that pamphlet from every school in Australia to which it has been sent and replace it with a balanced and fair presentation? Why would a Minister want to corrupt the minds of young people who are objective, who are now in training and who wish, when they are through that process, to have jobs and become useful contributors to society? One might ask why the Minister wished to lead those young people down the garden path and give them a totally false impression. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at some of the things that have happened in land management on the farm and deal, first of all, with one of the comments made in this pamphlet that has been sent out as part of the package. It says that nutrients leach into the water table and rivers, causing algae growth. No mention is made of the fact that CSBP in Western Australia has developed a fertiliser which fixes into the soil and prevents such things from happening. No mention is made of the fact that last year in Western Australia alone farmers on water charge areas planted some 20 million trees to stop some of the movement into the streams. No mention is made of the fact that those trees will make an enormous contribution to correcting the problems that have developed because of wind erosion. No mention is made of the fact that in the year prior to that some 12 million trees were planted and many thousands of kilometres of contour banks, drainage lines and interceptor banks were put in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no balance whatsoever. It just gets stuck into the poor old farmers, the graziers, or the cockies, as they are commonly known, who are living through some of the most difficult economic circumstances that this country has ever seen. Yesterday, a farmer from 50 miles north of Canberra rang me and said, `Can you get one message into that Parliament of Australia while you are there? I want this message into the Parliament. Will you tell them that, while the rest of Australia might be in recession, the farmers of this land are in serious depression?'. He is a woolgrower and a wheat grower, and he started outlining some points to back up what he was saying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at some of the constructive things that have been done&mdash;the sorts of messages that should be got out to the schools of this country to show what is really going on in rural Australia as far as land care and soil conservation programs are concerned, not the rubbish we have had presented to our school children. Back in 1982 there were approximately 25 Landcare groups in total in Australia. There are now over 1,000. Let us deal with Western Australia in isolation, because that is my State. We now find that 70 per cent of all Western Australian land users are involved in the 109 land conservation districts. That is not just farmers; that includes land users, it includes mining companies, it includes other groups who are involved in land use and management of some of the public estate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those 109 land conservation districts cover 75 per cent of the agricultural lands. The latest information I have is that that has grown to 90 per cent of agricultural lands. We find that 80 per cent of the pastoral lands of Western Australia are covered. As I understand it, that was the situation when this report was brought down. It is just a pity that Mrs Kelly did not take the time to read it, because it is very instructive and it would give her a much more accurate position of what the situation is in Australia at the current time. I understand that in Western Australia now about 85 per cent of pastoral areas are covered. That has all happened in the past 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would think that a Minister in the position which Mrs Kelly holds would in fact look at the facts before allowing the Department to send out this propaganda. Of course, she tries to do a Pontius Pilate and wipe her hands of the whole thing and blame her Department. I guess in due course it will come down to blaming somebody in her Department, as Senator Brownhill suggested. However, that does not excuse her position; it does not excuse the fact that she has not got control of her Department, if they can put out this type of nonsense and rubbish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the time I have remaining to me, I would like to look through some of the other facts, in terms of what has occurred in the various States. If we look at the national soil conservation projects, we will see that there are 23 of them around Australia. The twenty-third project is being run and supported by the Central Australian Aboriginal communities land management education program. In New South Wales there are 92 programs currently running; in Victoria there are 86; in Queensland there are 93; in South Australia there are 55; in Western Australia there are 80; in Tasmania there are 28; in the Northern Territory there are 25; and the Australian Capital Territory also has a number. What is wrong with Mrs Kelly pointing out some of the things that are going on? What is wrong with her showing what is happening with the individual farmers?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The biggest problem we have with the national soil conservation program at this time and with the land-care program, is not with the willingness of the farmers to carry it out, but with the economic policies of this current Government. It has virtually sent the farm sector down the drain. It has done that purely and simply by a misuse of monetary policy over the last five or six years. We have seen, through the use of interest rates, the whole farming sector ground into the dirt. During that period&mdash;the same period that I spoke about when these districts were developed&mdash;we have seen the take in fuel excise go from 6.8c a litre to 26c a litre, something that we are addressing in Fightback. We have seen the wholesale sales tax regime&mdash;which has had a very big impact on the farm sector, the very people Mrs Kelly seeks to denigrate here&mdash;increase from over $3 billion to in excess of $9 billion, peaking at $11.8 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mrs Kelly would be well advised, if she wants to communicate with Australian schoolchildren, to do it in a factual, fair and balanced way&mdash;not by denigrating the very people who provide much of the wealth of this country and who have addressed the particular problems that she misrepresents. One has to ask has she never heard&mdash;in terms of the well-being of the Australian community &mdash;that when the farm sector is doing well most of the rest of Australia is doing well. Will she ever realise that there are particular aspects of land management that have to be addressed in this nation of ours? We need to have a thriving, successful and prosperous farming industry and we will then have the dollars and cents to do what has to be done. The problems will then be addressed. There is no need to send out this propaganda, this rubbish. It is, I repeat, left wing communistic nonsense. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I seek to put on the record my strong approval and pleasure at yesterday's Sydney District Court decision in which a four-person jury found an employer guilty of negligence for failing to provide their employee with a smoke free work environment. It awarded her $85,000 in compensation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now this is a historic verdict. The employee, Ms Liesel Scholem, was employed as a psychologist by the New South Wales Department of Health. Notwithstanding that the Department had, on paper, a smoke free workplace for part of the time in which Ms Scholem worked for them, she suffered from passive smoke inhalation. At times, up to eight of her nine work colleagues smoked cigarettes in her presence. The jury found that her emphysema&mdash;a most distressing disease&mdash;and chronic asthma were contributed to by this passive inhalation over many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the energy, persistence and help that Dr Arthur Chesterfield Evans gave to Ms Scholem in the passage of this case over many years before it reached court. It is evident that, given Ms Scholem's chronic ill health, she has received an immense amount of support from many sympathisers and supporters over the years, chief among them being Dr Chesterfield Evans. It is the Non-Smokers Movement of Australia, of which Arthur is the president, that can also share in this victory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators may remember the historic decision of Mr Justice Morling in the Federal Court in February 1991 in which he held that passive smoking was a contributing factor to the development of a range of diseases of non-smokers, including asthma. These two decisions are of immense importance for the health and well-being of our community, and especially of our work force and our children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to the work force implications of these decisions, I wish to point out that clearly employers have a duty of care to their employees to make available smoke free work premises. Fortunately, the Commonwealth Public Service is largely smoke free. Fortunately, the vast majority of Commonwealth</PARA>
<PARA>employees are not subjected to passive smoking. Unfortunately, many of our State governments and their departments are not so enlightened. Worse still, many private enterprise employers either refuse to acknowledge the importance of this issue, or lack the will to implement sensible workplace policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is true to say that the Liesel Scholem case is the tip of an unfortunate iceberg. There are many cases of passive smoking victims in a range of occupations and social contexts. Consider, for example, the following: bar attendants, waiters, flight stewards, prison officers, nurses, cleaners, security guards, teachers, shop assistants and bus and tram conductors in some jurisdictions. In all of these occupations and others there is, or until very recently has been, some very real threat of permanent health damage being done to non-smokers through passive smoking. Our workplaces are long overdue for reform in this important matter. Employers, unions and the work force all need to sit down and implement sensible workplace policies. Even speaking of this place, I would say that once they have done that they then have to work out ways of having them implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, this has big implications for the hospitality industry among many others. The vast majority of the population&mdash;even the vast majority of smokers&mdash;when polled, have consistently said that they want smoke free dining in restaurants. So I call on restaurant owners and managers, and the unions in the hospitality industry to implement smoke free dining as a matter of urgency. How many Liesel Scholems are there in the hospitality industry alone? How long is it before a restaurant owner or manager is sued for negligence? How long will it be before a union is sued for failing to look after the interests of its members in regard to this particular occupational hazard?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I turn to the matter of children and passive smoking. I am pleased this is one of the main thrusts in the `Quit' week activities in some Australian States, some of which I will be participating in in my home State of Victoria this weekend. One of the great tragedies of smoking is that children are usually the passive victims, the silent victims. Passive smoking greatly increases the risk of unborn children having a greater than expected incidence of a whole range of childhood illnesses and diseases including leukemia, brain disorders and learning difficulties. These problems are now well-known to medical practitioners. The message is simple. Women who are pregnant should not smoke. There are also many older children who are passive victims suffering from a higher than expected incidence of asthma and other respiratory diseases as a result of smokers in their own household in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Scholem decision means that what has long been accepted by the medical and the caring professions is now established in law. For the sake of our work force and our children, this Parliament has a duty to legislate to minimise the glamour and attractiveness of smoking. It is not glamorous and it is not attractive: it is advertising's ultimate con job. Our work force, our children, our whole community suffer as a result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I applaud the Government's announcement that it will finally legislate to further limit tobacco advertising and, in particular and especially, its association with sport and cultural events. The Democrats will keep the Government to this recent promise, just as my own private member's Bill banning print advertising, which achieved all-party support in this Parliament at the end of 1989, saw the end of print advertising from the beginning of 1991. Just as that Democrat action pushed the issue further after 13 years of inaction, we will ensure that remaining advertising, sponsorship and promotion of this harmful product&mdash;expensive in terms of Australia's public health and of the health of individuals&mdash;stops. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition will support the Asian Development Fund Bill. However, there are some comments I wish to make. The first relates to the share of Australia's global aid budget that is allocated to international financial institutions, the so-called IFIs. The Government has made commitments to the World Bank that have substantially increased the share of the aid budget going to international financial institutions. The second reading speech of the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) states that on current projections of draw-down on Australian commitments, the share of the aid budget going to IFIs will rise to 18 per cent in 1994-95 compared with 8 per cent in the mid-1980s and 12 per cent in 1991-92. Thus we have been witnessing a steady rise in the percentage of the aid vote going to such institutions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We think the figure that has been reached to date is too high. The Government has never sought to justify the increase in the allocation to IFIs, although there are several factors that have obviously influenced the series of decisions that have led to this situation. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first is that the steady series of cuts in the aid program was never anticipated. The economy was always expected to do better and there was therefore no recognition that the commitments to international financial institutions that have been made, which have to be made well in advance, would fundamentally change the balance of the Australian global aid budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, there is the power and influence of the Treasury in this matter. Under the Government's practices, and I think the previous Australian Government's practices, the position of alternate executive director of the World Bank is provided to a member of the Australian Treasury. That tends to have some effect on the fact that multilateral aid seems to be the last to be cut. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not just my assessment, but I refer to the independent review of Australian multilateral aid as carried out by the Canadian North-South Institute, which attributed the continuation of high levels of support to IDA to `Australia's firm commitment to IDA and the power of the Treasury Department, IDA's senior champion within the bureaucracy'. That is at page 25 of that report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the Government and Treasury alike were no doubt unwilling to admit that the Australian economy would grind to a halt and thereby shrink the aid program when the IDA-9 pledge was made in 1990. The balance between the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, the ADB, in Australian contributions also has never been adequately explained. World Bank payments call for much larger contributions from Australia, but Australia's share of the ADB funds are larger &mdash;6.5 per cent in ADF-6 compared with 1.99 per cent in IDA-9. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The North-South Institute study describes Australia's contribution to the World Bank as `somewhat passive, formula driven, and a response to notions of good international citizenship', compared with the ADB involvement, which `has more passion since it addresses political, strategic and economic imperatives close to home'. It says that Australia is a player in Asia and much more a spectator on the world stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has been critical of the ADB's management, to the point of seriously considering a 10 per cent decrease in the expected share of ADF-5 in 1987-89. The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade supported this position, calling for higher standards of accountability and disclosure. In response to criticism from donor countries, the ADB established a panel of experts, which led to the introduction of improvements in reporting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's contributions to the International Fund for Agricultural Development, IFAD, should also be considered. For reasons that appear to be little more than ministerial whim, Australia announced in 1987 that it would not participate in the third replenishment of the International Fund for Agricultural Development. Following strong representations from Australian and international agencies and consultant communities and again a recommendation from the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, this decision was reversed, but it shows clearly the need for a proper articulation of the criteria by which Australian contributions to IFIs are determined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government needs to explain in more detail the decrease in Australia's share of ADF-6. Does it relate solely to questions of Australia's difficult economic and budgetary situation or is there an element of criticism of the ADB? The drop in Australia's share is 23.5 per cent, which is far more substantial than the threatened cut of 10 per cent in ADF-5. Is a similar cut presently being negotiated in Australia's share of IDA-10? Does the Government accept the assessment of the North-South Institute review that Australia is a player in Asia but more a spectator in world affairs? If so, will IDA-10 be cut more substantially than the Asian Development Fund procurement 6? If not, is the Prime Minister's talk of Australia's future in Asia no more than empty rhetoric?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to touch upon benefits which might flow to Australia from assistance to IFIs. Because the ADF and the IDA are restricted to low-income countries, Australia's contributions to these funds, by definition, contribute to the reduction of poverty. Given the concentration of the bilateral aid program on middle-income countries, the IFI contributions can be presented as providing a balance in the overall Australian program. However, it must be asked whether these contributions are effective in reducing poverty. The overall record of poor countries in reducing poverty as a result of contributions from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank is not encouraging. It is the better-off developing countries that seem to be doing better, both in achieving economic growth and in increasing equity. Indonesia, for example, has reduced poverty from more than 60 per cent of the population in 1970 to less than 20 per cent at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to ask ourselves whether our aid dollar might not be more effective in reducing poverty, as far as the bilateral program is concerned, by concentrating on the developing countries. Perhaps we can more directly assist those in greatest need, the poorest countries, by making a greater proportion of our contribution through small-scale NGO projects, which might be better targeted to those most in need. Certainly, when we are looking at loans that are made through the World Bank or the Asian Development Bank, there must be clear agreement on policy frameworks necessary for effective implementation of projects and programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to mention also the trade benefits that can flow from the program to Australia and how we could do better. The Asian Development Bank and the World Bank procurement programs provide opportunities for Australian suppliers of goods and services. The second reading speech refers to the ADB as a significant source of procurement for Australian business, but expresses the hope that Australia can increase its share of ADB business. In reality, however, Australia's record in IFI procurement is disappointing. On a cumulative basis, Australia has obtained 95c for every $1 provided to the ADB-ADF and $1.08 for each $1 provided to the World Bank-IDA group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When contributions are being considered, Australia's contributions are always presented as percentage shares of total contributions. Data on procurement, however, is always presented as dollars earned or dollars contributed. The fact that dollars contributed are leveraged with borrowed dollars is overlooked. The ADB and the World Bank have far more funds to lend than those contributed. I suggest respectfully that the Minister could in future present to the Senate data on our shares for procurement, and also say whether they are comparable to our shares of contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By comparison with other donors, the independent review by the Canadian-based North South Institute concludes that Australia's procurement record is `disappointing'. Australia's low share of procurement partly reflects the lack of international competitiveness. We cannot realistically expect to have a share of procurement comparable to that of Japan or other competitive exporters of manufactures unless we significantly increase our competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, there are areas where we can hope to improve the promotion of our exports. The second reading speech reference to an interdepartmental task force working on the problem suggests that the Government is conscious that it has not been doing enough. But one has to be an optimist to believe that an interdepartmental committee will find ways around the fundamental problem of lack of international competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before concluding I want to mention certain policy issues relating to the Asian Development Bank. Australia is the second largest donor to that bank and therefore has a significant role to play in ADB policy development. The second reading speech of the Minister refers to several areas where Australia has played an active role, but such expressions are in the most general of terms. We need to extend policy input beyond such broad, general issues. We need to ensure that Australia maintains a tough stance on issues of effectiveness. Any temptation to grant loans simply to achieve disbursement targets should be strongly resisted. Each project and program loan proposal should be scrutinised carefully and proposals that are not likely to be effective should be ruthlessly rejected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me conclude with a few comments on coalition policy. The Coalition supports the Australian contribution to the IFIs but believes that Australia's contribution should reflect Australia's economic reality. As I said at the outset, we believe that the proportion of the overall aid budget that is appropriated to IFIs has become too high. The maintenance of Australia's level of contribution to the World Bank in these difficult economic circumstances, and following substantial cuts in the overall aid program, is not justifiable. Australia's peripheral role in the World Bank means that a drop in the level of contribution would not have major adverse consequences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, given our larger role in the Asian Development Bank, our location within the region and the claimed successes of the Government in influencing ADB policy development, a case can be made for at least maintaining our existing level of commitment or only reducing it slightly. However, any cut in the level of the Australian ADF 6 share&mdash;23 per cent&mdash;should be matched by a cut of at least the same proportion as the World Bank's fund. The next contribution, which I understand is currently under negotiation, will be through IDA 10. Anything less would be totally inconsistent with recent Government rhetoric about the importance of Asia to Australia. With those few comments I confirm that which I said at the outset: the Opposition will support the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The chamber has been well served by the speech that was just made by Senator Hill. It is a speech which needs to be studied by the Government and responded to. I am also one who believes that far too great a percentage of our aid budget is going to the international financial institutions. As does Senator Hill, I consider it important to ensure that the aid gets directly to the people in very poor countries. One of the best ways of doing this is through NGOs, and through people who are on the ground there, including social groups, community organisations, churches and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, as we all know, much aid money does find its way into the pockets of governing cliques. A great deal of aid money is used to buy government cliques to empower themselves governmentally over the people that the aid is supposed to help. This has been an ongoing discussion in the aid area for many years. I do not need to relate to the Senate the various views that have been expressed over the years on that particular question. On another issue, where a large proportion&mdash;18 per cent or thereabouts&mdash;of aid money is going to the international financial institutions, do the representatives of the taxpayer, who is footing the bill, have effective policy control over where that money is spent? The Asian Development Bank, World Bank and other institutions are very large bureaucracies and a lot of the money is eaten up by administrative expenses. Of course it is necessary to have an effective administration, but I share Senator Hill's view that the percentage at present is far too high. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where you have large bureaucracies such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, it appears that they are able to develop policies which really tend to be political policies. I am concerned about these organisations' diversion of amounts of aid money from directly attacking the problems of poverty into areas such as population control policies. As a parliament and as a member country of the Asian Development Bank, we deserve a far more objective report on health, population and development in Asia and the Pacific than we were dealt by the Asian Development Bank in 1991.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That document simply accepts as a given the assertion that population growth is a crucial negative factor in development. That is not a given at all. There is no real academic consensus on that particular issue. Yet the other view that has been put forward by, amongst others, Julian Simon, and so on, academics of world renown, is not even given a mention here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the same thing as we had yesterday. Over the last couple of years, in addressing AIDAB at Estimates committee hearings, one was trying to find out certain features of the population control program in China. AIDAB then commissioned a report which gave only one side of that area. When I asked for a more balanced and objective report to be provided it was not done; in fact, it was refused. So I sent the AIDAB report to a China expert in America, an absolutely world renowned expert, a former research analyst with the Bureau of the Census' China desk in Washington&mdash;Dr John S. Aird. Yesterday I was able to table in this place a document from Dr Aird in response to the AIDAB document. That was a 72-page document, with 186 footnotes, which completely demolished the AIDAB document upon which the Government's policies are based. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that we have an open-minded approach to this, not a closed-minded approach. It is unfair to blame the fertility of poor women in developing countries. These have been made the scapegoat for a range of problems from environmental damage to famine, the causes of which are war and political instability and man's inhumanity to man. These are the sorts of things that we ought to be considering. The report makes the point that where growing standards of living occur, the fertility rate tends to decline. That is not an absolute and general rule but it is overwhelmingly the experience. But what I am asking for really is a more scholarly approach to this question and not an acceptance of the `givens' which are promoted by other international bureaucracies which have a vested interest in the area. I refer to UNFPA and IPPF. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply stand here and appeal to the Government that such an approach be taken, so that policies are determined on the basis of the truth which has been discerned after scholarly efforts have been made, and genuine attempts by politicians and bureaucrats have been made to obtain the truth, having sought it with an open mind. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. On 22 November last year, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was made aware of the Sibraa letter to Washington which included the assertion, now known to be false, that the President of the Marshall Islands had asked the Australian Government to help Mr Symons in relation to his, that is, Symons's, business. Did the Department bring to the Minister's attention this serious error? Did the Minister or his Department bring to the attention of Senator Sibraa the error contained in his letter?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question is based on a false premise. We have had a long debate and discussion about what the Sibraa letter intended to say and what it did say and the gap in the language accordingly. Senator Sibraa has made it perfectly clear that the only information before him and his staff member, Mr Peppinck, at the time that the letter was written was the physical presence of Mr Symons before him claiming to be exercising some delegated authority, holding himself out to be representing the Marshall Islands Government, and he, Mr Symons, asking for Australian Government assistance, through Senator Sibraa to the Washington Embassy, to pursue the particular matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In debating Senator Sibraa's statement a couple of days ago, we discussed at considerable length&mdash;and I certainly said at considerable length then, and I do not need to repeat it at that length&mdash;what is the proper interpretation of Senator Sibraa's letter. I quote the relevant sentence of the letter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . President Kabua has sought the assistance of the Australian Government in expediting discussions in Washington with key US Government officials. . . </PARA>
<PARA>What he was obviously intending to say was, `President Kabua has, through Mr Symons, sought the assistance of the Australian Government'. There was no belief at any stage&mdash;and Senator Sibraa has made this perfectly clear&mdash;that there had been any separate request. Certainly, as I understand it, he had not been told that there had been any separate request directly on a government to government basis. This was simply an infelicitous and incomplete recording of the particular circumstance that Senator Sibraa found himself confronting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, I was not made aware of this letter at the time of the letter being faxed back from the Embassy in Washington to Canberra, nor at the time that Canberra followed it up by sending it to our Ambassador in Pohnpei to see what he could find out about it. Nobody seemed to attribute any particular significance to the phrase in question, so far as I have been advised, nor so far as appears from the documents, no doubt because everyone was reading this as a straightforward and simple letter of introduction which was self-contained and which was not, in fact, containing a reference to some prior and separate communication from the Marshall Islands to the Australian Government because, of course, it is the case that there was never any such separate communication.</PARA>

They certainly did not bring it to my attention or to the attention of my office.

I welcome the Gyles report into the building and construction industry in New South Wales and the Government will respond fully and properly after we have had a chance to receive and digest the 5,000-plus pages of that report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three weeks ago I wrote to the Minister for Industrial Relations in New South Wales, with a copy of my letter to the Premier of New South Wales, saying in anticipation of the Gyles report that I would stand ready to include in the Federal Government's building industry reform strategy any suggestions or recommendations that came forward from that report which were constructive and useful; and that remains the case. For the record, I have not received a reply from either the Minister for Industrial Relations or the Premier in New South Wales, nor have I received an overture from either of those people, despite their public announcements in the media over the last two days. No formal approach has been made by that Government to me or this Government for talks or discussions arising out of what they style as matters of high concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first thing I did when I became Minister for Industrial Relations in 1990&mdash;as I recall, I was sworn in on the last day in March&mdash;was to take action to implement a reform strategy for the building and construction industry in Australia. The record is that, at the MOLAC meeting in Queenstown, New Zealand, in April, I placed this matter on the agenda for the Ministers for labour of the various States of the Commonwealth meeting with the Federal Government. From that point on, I have rigorously pursued a program to reform this industry, because it is an industry in dire need of reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program came to its culmination in October of last year when the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, announced the reform strategy of the Federal Government for the building and construction industry in Australia&mdash;a reform strategy which all the State governments in this Commonwealth, except the State Government of New South Wales and the State Government of Tasmania, have signed their commitment to. I might also say that it is a reform strategy that all the major players in the industry&mdash;all of the major employer organisations, unions, industry associations and support associations of the professions&mdash;have committed themselves to as well. This is a substantial reform strategy which is addressing the problems in the industry and achieving success.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been 22-odd reports into problems about the building and construction industry in Australia. It seemed to us as a Federal government that there was no need for yet a further inquiry which would have the effect of simply supporting the inquiry industry rather than doing something about the building industry. There was a need to act on the body of information that was publicly available and achieve change and reform. So our approach has been not to conduct an inquiry to add yet another unimplemented report to the shelves of libraries to gather dust but actually to do something about resolving the problem.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> On the face of what I now know of the findings of the Gyles royal commission, the only new thing that seems to me to have come out which was not on the public record before is the outrageous and disgusting revelations&mdash;and I congratulate Gyles for the way in which he carried out this public duty&mdash;of the collusive tendering practices that have been going on, supported by some industry associations, it is alleged, among major tenderers for building contracts in this country. I am not sure how widespread it is, but Gyles has revealed a massive rort which has cost taxpayers and clients of this industry around Australia billions of dollars. In that context it is passing strange that, on the announcement of the findings of this commission, all the Premier of New South Wales could refer to in his two-page formal press release was attacks upon a building union, with not one mention of the problems of collusive tendering and the massive rorts and costs to this community that that has revealed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make this clear: if there are matters of illegal conduct in the building industry in New South Wales, they should be prosecuted in a court of law. One does not need a royal commission to do it. But if the royal commission has served its duty&mdash;which I believe it has&mdash;those involved should be prosecuted and dealt with under the due process of the law. If there is a case for the deregistration of a union, the New South Wales Government should take that case to the Industrial Court in New South Wales and let the proper authority, the Industrial Court, make the judgment. It does not need to have the Commonwealth holding its hand in doing that.</PARA>

The Minister will also be aware that the matter was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Marshall Islands </EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Journal</EMPHASIS> of 10 April, including the Attorney-General's statement that it was feared, because of Mr Symons's influential friends in the Australian Government, that he would leave the Marshall Islands and never return. The matter was then raised in the Victorian Parliament on 16 April. Further publicity continued from 29 April when Senator Richardson's involvement was reported. I ask the Minister: is it not the usual practice for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to provide briefings to the Minister in relation to such reports? Was the Minister provided with the usual briefings in relation to each of those reports?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Everyone in the chamber knows that one gets the answer according to the question asked and the way it is phrased. I was somewhat puzzled by that opinion poll as the Defence Force public relations area, I think twice a year, polls people generally on their attitude. The last one of those shows that four out of five Australians thought we were well placed to defend Australia. I suspect that our own polling is a little high and that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> polling is a little low and, therefore, the real result is somewhere in the middle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was also very puzzled to see a press release come out saying that the Opposition, having looked at this particular poll, favours an increase in defence expenditure. It took some time to track down who the Opposition spokesman was; I was quite puzzled. As it turns out, it was the shadow Minister, Mr Downer, who put out that press release. I was a bit puzzled by this because when one looks at the Fightback policy one will see that spending on the Defence portfolio is to be cut by 2 per cent in real terms in the second year of operation. This seemed rather strange to me. Of course, I might have been able to resolve the conflict between Opposition defence policy on the one hand and Fightback on the other if indeed there were an Opposition defence policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleagues will, of course, remember that the Liberal Party, in an opportunistic way, in the middle of the Gulf conflict set up a committee of review to report on defence policy and provide an alternative within four months. Some 17 months later, of course, we have seen nothing. We do know that the committee met six times last year. As a result of an interchange between two of us in this chamber, we established that the committee had met only six times. I am looking forward to its report simply to see how Mr Downer tries to resolve this question. I know not everyone in his own party room agrees with it: it is probably one of the most contentiously debated aspects of Fightback within the coalition. To cut back defence spending by 2 per cent under the current circumstances is quite amazing. The coalition then goes on to argue that it will have a $300m enhancement of the combat section.</PARA>

They should go and do their sums and come back and dispute it if they like.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition goes on to say that it will have another $300m injection and that it will achieve that through redundancies on the civilian side of the Department of Defence. To add up, that has to be on top of a program put in place by us to reduce civilians by 15 per cent over eight or nine years along the redundancy line. The really interesting thing in Fightback is that two departments are exempted for supplementation for redundancy&mdash;the Department of Industrial Relations and the Department of Defence. So to try to achieve the $300m injection it will have to let thousands of staff go and pay redundancy for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be no gain in the first year, no gain in the second year, and gain will be highly dubious in the third year. In the fourth year out I concede that some money starts to be saved and the coalition might be able to have its $300m injection&mdash;down the track, four years later, having ripped $200m off in the second year continuously out into the out years of the Budget. Yet Mr Downer says we should increase defence expenditure. All I can say is that that is monumental opportunism by him and monumental hypocrisy. He obviously has not read the Fightback documents that included these sorts of cuts in the defence expenditure.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The questions raised by Senator Coulter involve rather delicate matters of judgment, not only as to what one should do but also as to how what one does in all propriety and honesty might be perceived, and the implications that flow from that. I was really very conscious of that. It was a matter of responding very quickly to a request that was made to me by Senator Richardson in what he described, from the outset, as being a private legal matter involving a relative by marriage who was in trouble.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You will recall, Mr President, from when I gave the full details of our conversation, that Senator Richardson had been asked specifically in a phone call by the defence lawyer to make a representation himself directly to the President of the Marshall Islands. Senator Richardson was wanting to assist the person in question, obviously, but was a little troubled by the protocol dimensions of this. That is the way Senator Richardson put it me: `What is the Foreign Affairs protocol of making such an approach?'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was anxious to help him as best we could, and we had quite a substantial conversation about the way in which the matter could be handled. The result was that I said to him, `You must make this phone call in your capacity as a private citizen and not in any way hold yourself out to be representing the Australian Government'. Of course, he had the status of a Minister and he could not change that status. But all of us on this front bench have that status. We can and we do change our roles. When I talk, for example, to the headmaster of my daughter's school, I am not doing so as Foreign Minister; I am doing so as a father, although I remain Foreign Minister. The point is a reasonable one to make in the situation: provided one makes it clear in the conversation in question that the basis on which you are making a representation is not the basis of the status that you may have, but your particular role as someone who is trying to help. That was the first point, and it was a very important point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter was that I put very squarely to Senator Richardson&mdash;not that he needed to be persuaded on this&mdash;that his representation must confine itself to the particular question of the executive discretion involved as to whether or not the gentleman's passport would be taken away or returned to him, in the context of the kind of prosecutorial decision that would have to be made as to whether to seek the removal of the passport or not. It was obvious that anything that could be construed as an attempt to interfere in any way with the determination of guilt or innocence on the substantive matter in question would be wholly inappropriate. It was on the basis of everything that Senator Richardson has said on the public record that I believe the call took place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The particular question of speaking to the President of a country as distinct from the prosecuting attorney, the head of the law department, another Minister, another senior official or something of this kind, is obviously one that also raised itself in the course of this discussion. As I have said previously, it is a somewhat unusual situation, obviously, to be calling the President of another country. That is again something that was troubling Senator Richardson. But he had been asked specifically by the defence lawyer to call the President, so obviously the defence was not concerned about this being counterproductive or being seen to be improper in Marshall Island's terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the reality. As I said to Senator Richardson, I have been to the Marshall Islands, I know the scale and the kind of place it is. Small Pacific islands operate in accordance with different sorts of practical conventions as to the way in which business and government operate, than elsewhere. Very often it is the case that the senior executive official, or elected official in this case, is really the only person to deal with if you are trying to get something done quickly or some executive discretion exercised, as was the case here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was an element of urgency about it. Senator Richardson understood that the matter was going to be addressed in court later that morning. In fact, as he said in his report, he made an attempt to call later that morning, 3 April. So it was not a situation that gave me a lot of opportunity for reflection and thinking about, even though, in the event, Senator Richardson was unable to make his call and get through until 6 April. Opinions can differ about these things. As I began by saying, it is a delicate matter of judgment. I believe that the advice I gave&mdash;that it was okay, provided these various constraints were observed&mdash;was appropriate advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the other part of the question about the circumstances in which it is ever appropriate for governments or government Ministers to make representations in court matters involving Australian citizens, this is an issue that has arisen from time to time. It is squarely on our plate at the moment in the context of the Australian citizen, McAuliffe, in Malaysia. The principle that we have adopted as a government is that we do not in any way seek to participate in the process before the matter is finally heard and determined by the court process. But when it comes to the matter of the exercise of executive clemency, it is appropriate on occasion for some representation to be made. Such representation has now been made in the McAuliffe case by the Prime Minister and me.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I am not aware that Senator Evans's daughter is at a foreign school or, indeed, is under arrest in a foreign country. It seems to me that the decision to withhold the passport was, according to the Minister's reply just given, a legal decision. Consequently, the Minister concerned&mdash;former Minister Richardson&mdash;was intervening in a legal decision. The question again is, should we? It seems to me from the latter part of the Minister's reply that he would have to agree that it is not appropriate for other Ministers to intercede in something which goes to a legal matter which is before the courts in a foreign country; it is not at that stage an executive matter.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, it is a matter of the proper legal characterisation of it. The decision made by the prosecution to prosecute is essentially an executive decision. A decision made by a prosecution to seek a particular result from the court, so far as the passport withholding is concerned, is an executive decision made by the prosecution as the executive arm of government. It is not as if one is seeking to ring up the judge and say, `Can you please make your judicial decision in a way that gives assistance to or acknowledges the rights of my relative to prepare his defence?'. If one had rung the judicial officer directly, obviously, whether one is acting in an official capacity, a private capacity or anything else, very real questions of impropriety would arise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there is a twilight zone when one is talking about executive discretion and executive decisions of this kind and that was something that I thought was a relevant distinction.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. In the preparation of the One Nation statement, senior Ministers consulted widely with business and community groups. Can the Minister inform the Senate whether the Government plans a program of community consultation as it draws up the Budget over the next few months?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The process of Budget consultation has already begun. The EPAC secretariat has asked for the views of 25 community and business organisations. That will be followed up by others concerned with the preparation of the Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the One Nation statement was being prepared, there was an extensive process of community consultation which concerned a number of people, like Senator Short and Dr Hewson, who took it upon themselves to make fools of themselves by ringing businessmen around the country and telling them that they should not consult with the Government. That is a very sad fact, which Senator Short does not deny. He publicly made a fool of himself by embarking on that process. The process of community consultation on this occasion will not be aborted by any efforts by Senator Short or anybody else to interfere with it, particularly in terms of business consultation. I must say that that process played a very important part in the preparation of One Nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Opposition has abandoned any pretence of consultation on the same lines. The Opposition is to have an American style convention to which business people will be invited&mdash;a sort of Charles Manson family at play to which all sorts of business people will be invited to see a spectacular collection of Opposition spokesmen. Of course, the Government, in the process of drafting the Budget, will consult with business, community groups and the States. The consultation process ensures that the Government has a view of groups in the community. It will be a process of working sessions.</PARA>

We will embark, as we always do, on a genuine process of political consultation in the period leading up to the Budget. We will not be charging $750 a head.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After checking with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans, to ensure that I was not acting improperly, I rang Mr Amata Kabua, the President of the Marshall Islands on 6 April.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The conversation lasted less than five minutes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In introducing myself, I made it clear that I was not ringing in my official ministerial capacity, but on the basis that I knew the individual concerned and wanted to clarify what the possibilities might be.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I pointed out that I was not familiar with their judicial system and understood that Mr Symons' passport had been confiscated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I said it would seem reasonable for him to be allowed to prepare his case, which in this instance would require him to gain access to documents held in Australia.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Kabua gave me no undertakings other than to say he'd look into the matter.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the statement made by Senator Richardson that day. I cannot remember whether he consulted with me before he put this statement out or not.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I ask: firstly, what is the Australian Government's response to the peace plan put forward by Jose Ramos Horta on behalf of the Fretilin leader, Xanana Gusmao, which indicates that East Timorese opposition groups are prepared to engage in unconditional talks with Indonesia under United Nations auspices? Secondly, does the Minister accept that this plan represents a reasonable proposal for implementing a long term strategy of reconciliation in East Timor? Thirdly, is the Government aware that the Catholic, Anglican and Uniting churches in Australia have all given their unequivocal backing to this proposal?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2909" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have already said publicly that the Horta proposal is one that I find interesting but it is not one on which the Government proposes to take any action. I have said that for two reasons: first, it is by no means clear that the proposal enjoys the support of the East Timorese community either in East Timor or here&mdash;or at least the across-the-board support. There are a lot of different streams and currents of opinion. For example, I understand&mdash;although I did not hear it directly myself&mdash;that on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The </EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">World Today</EMPHASIS> radio program of 21 May the Australia-based East Timorese activist Alfredo Ferreira was reported as saying that he doubted whether there would be widespread support for the idea of ceasing to resist Indonesian rule, and Mr Horta's views are his own and do not necessarily represent those of other East Timorese.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there is a question mark at the outset as to its representative status but that does not go to its quality. As to that&mdash;this is the second point&mdash;to the extent that that proposal of Mr Horta's leaves open the question of sovereignty over East Timor, it simply is inconsistent with the position that the Australian Government has adopted since 1979 when de jure recognition was extended by the then coalition government, and that recognition has been maintained, as Senator Bourne would know, by successive Labor governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ultimately, the Horta proposal is one for the Indonesian Government to respond to and if the Indonesian Government is minded to go down that particular path, then so be it. We will certainly follow the process with some fascination. What I can say positively about the Horta proposal is that if it does have the effect of contributing to an atmosphere of longer term reconciliation, if it does have the effect of contributing to a longer term reconciliation process in East Timor, to that extent we would, of course, welcome it. We have been stressing the need for such a process of longer term reconciliation ever since the Dili killings, quite apart from all the shorter term reactive measures that we have been arguing for. That process should include improved social and economic development and certainly greater recognition of East Timor's distinctive cultural identity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also said to the Indonesian authorities&mdash;and I have made the point personally a number of times&mdash;that reconciliation might be very much assisted by giving the local people of East Timor a significantly greater say in the running of their affairs. Whether one calls that autonomy or by some other name is less important than the practical reality of it. We have also made it clear that the security forces in East Timor, for as long as they remain there&mdash;and we hope that will not be very long&mdash;certainly need to be more sensitive to the needs and aspirations of the East Timorese people. So to the extent that that is an element in the Horta proposal, we certainly support that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Despite my unstinting efforts to publicise the very significant improvements in the Australian waterfront, the myth still persists that Australia is lagging behind its trading partners. The reason I make that point is that yesterday I did notice some media comment that I have been quiet about this performance improvement and, of course, the Opposition in here has complained loudly and consistently that I have been too loud about it. Perhaps that particular section of the Fourth Estate can correct its own perceptions by translating this piece of good news from out of here into the real world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Waterfront Industry Reform Authority, WIRA, has today released its latest set of performance figures for Australian ports and those figures contain a very good news story for Australia. I have previously advised that stevedores have reported significant productivity improvements as a result of the major restructuring of our stevedoring industry. All major ports have now moved to enterprise employment, and in fact the only block of regional ports left to go is in Western Australia. These regional ports are also introducing new labour arrangements, which will be completed by the end of October.</PARA>

This compares with average container rates of around 12 an hour in 1989 when the reforms commenced and an average of 15 per hour in the last WIRA report.

In terms of Australia's overseas image, it is about time that people&mdash;whilst pointing out what still needs to be done&mdash;gave some public and ungrudging acknowledgment of the significant improvements in the performance of Australian ports.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With reference to my Question on Notice No. 1721 on March 30 in which I asked the Minister "how much finance has the Commonwealth contributed to the (NSW) Master Builders' Association Apprenticeship Scheme'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.Does he agree that his answer which refers to administrative costs and states that "the NSW Master Builders' Association Group Training Scheme has never been funded by the Commonwealth" is seriously deficient by not mentioning Commonwealth funding to the NSW Master Builders' Association under other headings;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.Would the Minister explain why he provided a seriously, and apparently intentionally, misleading answer by mentioning the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full-Time Training (CRAFT) in general terms and yet omitting to disclose that under CRAFT the MBA received a total of $2,197,739 during the years between 1988/89 and 1991/92;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.Is the Minister's answer that no audit reports were requested by the Commonwealth still correct, and if in fact no audit reports were requested, why not, since we now know that the Minister's earlier answer was incorrect and that the Commonwealth in fact did contribute funds to the NSW MBA Group Training Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Cook&mdash;The Minister for Employment, Education and Training has provided the following answer to the honourable Senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.No. My answer to Question 1721 identified correctly that the NSW Master Builders' Association Group Apprenticeship Scheme has never been funded by the Commonwealth under the Commonwealth/State and Territory Policy on Financial Assistance to Group Schemes, and that group schemes are eligible for and receive employer incentives under the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full-Time Training (CRAFT) and the Australian Traineeship System (ATS) at current rates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.For the reasons identified above the answer provided was not, nor was it intended to be, misleading.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.Yes. Since the Commonwealth has not provided any contributions to the establishment costs or administration of the NSW Master Builders' Association Group Apprenticeship Scheme, it has not called for audit reports. The principal sources of Commonwealth subsidy for apprenticeship group training schemes are twofold:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">i)firstly, a subsidy, provided under the Commonwealth/State and Territory Policy on Financial Assistance to Group Schemes, as a contribution towards the administrative costs of schemes.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator O'Chee asked me a question without notice on Tuesday this week about the public documents relating Mr Gregory Symons's composition under part X of the Bankruptcy Act held on the public file at the registry of the Federal Court in Sydney. I have a fairly long answer but, given the time that Senator O'Chee spent regaling the chamber on this matter, I should perhaps express it rather than seek to incorporate it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator O'Chee alleged that certain important public documents were missing from the file and implied that those documents had been deliberately removed so as to prevent them from being publicly disclosed. He repeated those allegations in the Senate again yesterday. It is now time to put this matter to rest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apparently what occurred is that on Tuesday morning of this week a search clerk from a firm of solicitors went to the counter of the Sydney registry of the Federal Court on Senator O'Chee's behalf to search the file regarding Mr Gregory Symons. That file was produced and the search clerk asked the counter officer to find three documents: the statement of affairs; what he called the `deed of arrangement'; and what was termed a `certificate of release'. The statement of affairs was located, but the other two documents sought were not there. This is not surprising.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three kinds of arrangements can be entered into under part X of the Bankruptcy Act: a deed of arrangement; a deed of assignment; and a composition. Mr Symons entered into a composition. Therefore, no deed of arrangement would or could have been on the file. Neither was there, nor could there have been, a document on the file entitled `certificate of release'. There is no document by that name relevant to a composition under part X of the Bankruptcy Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two of the three documents sought by Senator O'Chee&mdash;or at least by the clerk; I presume, acting on his specific instructions&mdash;from the file, were not present because they did not and could not exist. It is true that the counter officer, in accordance with normal practice, removed from the file what is called the correspondence folder before providing it to the search clerk. It is the practice of the Sydney registry of the Federal Court to maintain all correspondence in a separate manila folder within the file&mdash;that is, letters addressed to the registry, letters from the registry, internal file notes and the like. These are not public documents filed pursuant to the Bankruptcy Act and rules and are, therefore, not normally provided for public search.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, as with all files which are the subject of continual inspection by members of the public, public documents can sometimes be misplaced in this correspondence folder. I understand that in this case the statement of affairs had been misplaced in the correspondence folder but that after inspection by the counter officer, that document was placed in the file and then made available for inspection by Senator O'Chee's representative. I should add that at no time did the counter officer say that any documents were confidential. Indeed, I understand that Senator O'Chee is welcome to inspect the correspondence folder at any time but that he will find it contains no documents of substantive significance. Many people have examined the public file often, paying the prescribed fee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, the vital point is that the public file relating to Mr Gregory Symons was fully intact and contained all public documents when it was provided to Senator O'Chee's representative. It may be that Senator O'Chee's representative was confused by the entirely separate facts that, firstly, two of the documents sought by Senator O'Chee were not present because they do not exist; and, secondly, the fact that in accordance with normal practice, the correspondence folder was removed from the public file for inspection. Senator O'Chee, of course, leapt inevitably to the wrong conclusion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the basis of this thorough and comprehensive investigation, Senator O'Chee then rushed into the Senate and asked a question without notice in which he alleged that important public documents were missing from the file&mdash;which they were not&mdash;and implied that they had been deliberately removed as part of some cover-up. On the basis of confusion or misdirection on the part of the clerk engaged on his behalf, Senator O'Chee made a very serious allegation. What he was, in effect, alleging was that an officer or officers of the Federal Court of Australia had, presumably at the Government's behest for some political purpose, deliberately removed public documents from a public court file and concealed them from public search. It is disgraceful that Senator O'Chee would make such allegations on such a flimsy basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It gets worse. Naturally, inquiries were put in train as a result of Senator O'Chee's question without notice. As a result of those inquiries, I advised Senator O'Chee that evening that the public Federal Court file on Mr Symons was intact and contained all appropriate documents and that no documents were missing. I provided him with copies of the major documents from the file, including the section 188 authority; the statement of affairs, which I understand he already had a copy of; the statement by the debtor proposing a composition; the report by the controlling trustee; the minutes of the meeting of creditors and related documents; a special resolution of that meeting; the controlling trustee's certificate that a special resolution for the acceptance of a composition had been passed to the meeting of creditors; and, finally, the certificate by the trustee that the terms of the composition had been carried out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Copies of all these documents were provided to Senator O'Chee on Tuesday evening with advice that while these constituted the primary documents of significance, the whole of the file could be accessed during normal business hours at the Federal Court registry in Sydney. I emphasise that it was made abundantly clear to Senator O'Chee that at no stage had there been any public documents missing from the Federal Court file.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also understand that Senator O'Chee personally had telephone conversations during Tuesday afternoon with relevant officers of the court registry, including the Sydney registrar, Mr Gilroy, who assured him that documents from the public files were not withheld as confidential. At that point one might have expected that Senator O'Chee would have come into the Senate and expressed his apology for the allegations he had made, particularly to the officers of the Federal Court of Australia whom he had implicitly maligned so seriously. Not only did that not occur, but almost incredibly Senator O'Chee stood up yesterday and repeated allegations which he could not fail to know by then were completely untrue and without foundation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator O'Chee attempted in his speech yesterday to make much of the fact that I said in my press release on Tuesday evening that his representative had looked at the wrong file and that this was not correct. The Inspector-General in Bankruptcy, who relayed this information to me as a result of his telephone inquiries of the Federal Court, has since advised me that this should have read `was looking for the wrong documents', as he had misinterpreted what he had been told on the subject.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This does not detract from the main thrust of my press release or the advice I gave to Senator O'Chee; though to the extent that it may reflect on the competence of the search clerk to look at the correct file I naturally apologise. What he apparently did was to ask for the wrong documents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, so as to ensure that there can be no possible misunderstanding, I repeat that the public Federal Court file concerning the composition under part X of the Bankruptcy Act entered into by Mr Gregory Bernard Symons is and was at all times entirely intact and available for public search during business hours. No public documents are, or ever have been, missing from it.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answers of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) in response to questions without notice asked by Senator Alston on 26 May and 28 May 1991 relating to Senator Graham Richardson.</PARA>
<PARA>The matter of concern on 26 May and, indeed, today was the nature and extent of the involvement of Senator Richardson in a very large-scale commercial project. On its face, it is one that should give rise to a great deal of concern in that an experienced member of parliament&mdash;he having been in Parliament by that time for some four years&mdash;deliberately chose to bypass the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Dr Garnaut, as the Australian Ambassador to China at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The answer provided by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) discloses the duration of the visit, being 5 to 7 March. It tells me quite gratuitously that no assistance was provided by Austrade. However, I did not seek that information. I sought details as to the nature and extent of Senator Richardson's visit; whether he received any payment, remuneration or recompense for his services; and details of the level of concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear that it would be very unusual for an ambassador to feel the need to contact a Prime Minister about the activities of a backbencher in a foreign country. One can only assume that Dr Garnaut was very concerned indeed. I would be very surprised if his concern merely extended to an apparent breach of protocol. It is much more likely that what exercised Dr Garnaut's mind was that Senator Richardson may well have had a commercial interest in the activities that he was pursuing. Senator Evans's answer seems to confirm that Senator Richardson was indeed acting as an intermediary&mdash;he has not denied that element of the proposition&mdash;and one can therefore understand that Dr Garnaut would have been particularly concerned to know the nature and extent of Senator Richardson's activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is therefore of the utmost importance that Senator Evans should provide the Senate with more detailed information as to whether Senator Richardson received any payment, remuneration or recompense for his services. There would clearly be a matter not just of impropriety but conflict of interest for a member of parliament to receive any money, any form of recompense or consideration for involvement in a commercial project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a matter which ought to have been disclosed, if not at the time, certainly to this chamber and certainly by way of explanation to the Prime Minister.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Evans has chosen to provide scant details of a matter on which he acknowledges there was concern on the part of Dr Garnaut. He has investigated the matter to the point that Dr Garnaut has recently had a discussion with his Department. Senator Evans is clearly aware of some of the details, but he chooses to not make all of them available. The gravamen of the concern is that Senator Richardson may well have been involved in a commercial project, he may well have received some recompense, Dr Garnaut may well have been outraged at that fact; yet we have not been told anything of the detail of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot for a moment imagine that Dr Garnaut felt compelled to ring the Prime Minister simply because of a breach of protocol. It must have gone well beyond that. If the Minister does not regard it as a matter of the utmost seriousness, I cannot understand where he ever draws the line. I therefore invite the Minister to table all relevant documents to ensure that the Senate is made fully aware of Senator Richardson's activities, concern over which can only be heightened, I might say, by the second part of my question today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear that Senator Richardson has made a habit of visiting this part of the world on a very regular basis. Given that we have now had it confirmed today that he was in fact acting as an intermediary&mdash;I think the Minister's words were `seeking to assist Multiplex and Kumagai Gumi'&mdash;we ought to know the basis on which he did that, the circumstances that led him to do what he did and whether there was any quid pro quo. These are matters which go very much to the heart of not just propriety on the part of the Minister's Department but also matters that obviously concerned the Ambassador and which were relayed to the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We ought to know what the Prime Minister's response was. Did the Prime Minister merely say, `Do not do it again, Richo' or `You are Richo so I will not even hit you with a feather' or did he say, `Do it again and you will get the chop. If anyone else did it in similar circumstances I would cut him off at the knees'? We ought to know these things. We ought to know just what response this Government makes if there is evidence of a member of Parliament, clearly someone who was close to the highest echelons of government and who was on the verge of becoming a Minister, choosing to involve himself in what would be a very unusual level of activity for a member of Parliament. I ask the Minister to provide full and frank details accordingly. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It really is a pretty extraordinary thing I am being asked to further investigate. It is a conversation between an ambassador who is no longer an ambassador and a Prime Minister who is no longer a Prime Minister about a person who is no longer a Minister and who was not at the time a Minister, in a situation where obviously the basic nature of the concern by the Ambassador, as I have already intimated, was essentially a concern simply at not being advised of the presence of Senator Richardson in the country in relation to a major commercial project in which the Government obviously had an interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the basis of my knowledge of the situation, everything else that Senator Alston has said has been totally fanciful.

<PARA>The answer to the question today by Senator Cook to Senator Burns was notable for two things: firstly, when Senator Cook was challenged on a point of order to declare whether or not he had a conflict of interest regarding the question before him and whether or not he was a member of the BWIU, he declined to do so; and, secondly, in the macho-ness of his answer, he failed to spell out what the Federal Government's response would be to the Gyles report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will deal with the second matter first. I note that in his answer today Senator Cook spelt out that members of the MBA, or people involved in the building industry, should be prosecuted for the wrongs that they have done. I do not have an argument with that. He then went on to spell out the fact that the New South Wales Government should take action against the BWIU if it wanted to proceed with the deregistration proceedings against the BWIU. In the Gyles report there is a recommendation for the deregistration of the federal BWIU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question I pose to the Government and to Senator Cook is: why did he not address that particular aspect? It is all very well to come into the chamber, thump the table and say that everybody else should take action to end the corruption that has been pointed to in the report, but not spell out what the Government's position is. The Government has a very clear responsibility in terms of the Gyles report and it will be interesting to hear in due course what that action will be. I suspect from the dorothy dix question asked by Senator Burns today that the Minister has already given notice that the Federal Government intends to do nothing. </PARA>

The Minister could have spelt out quite clearly to this chamber the fact that he is still a member of the BWIU.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me go to what has been said here. It was said that I was asked to disclose my interests. I was not. I was asked a question going to my ministerial responsibilities by Senator Burns. He asked me a question about the Gyles Royal Commission's report into the New South Wales building and construction industry. I replied that I welcomed the report and the findings. I said that, upon being sworn in as Minister by the Governor-General, one of my first acts&mdash;and the public record on this matter is available&mdash;in April 1990 was to raise the question of building industry and building construction reform in this country with the State Ministers for labour at the conference in Queenstown, New Zealand in which the State and the Commonwealth Ministers for labour met and discussed issues of importance. That was my first ministerial act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did that for this reason: for a long time I had been concerned about the state of the building industry in this country. It is also a fact that, as a Minister, I took action and in 1990 put down legislation in this chamber, which was carried, to deregister the Builders Labourers Federation for another period of time, given its reprehensible behaviour and the actions and intimations of criminality on its behalf. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It cannot be said by anybody that I have not acted responsibly. When I did that, my action was acclaimed by the industry, the Master Builders Association, the Australian Federation of Construction Contractors, the State governments concerned and the ACTU. As a consequence of taking that action, I did not think, and I do not think, that to simply move against an organisation constitutes cleaning up the industry because it does not. </PARA>

The nature of this industry&mdash;which operates on the basis of the lowest tender being successful, and employment lasting as long as the job takes to build&mdash;might be euphemistically described as tough and difficult, and it is an industry in which many of the participants seek to cut corners. It may be euphemistically described in those terms. To just pick on one element of the industry and deal with that is not to say that the complete picture of problems has been solved.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Gyles Royal Commission has brought forward new information.

The most significant finding and new information that came out of the evidence that Gyles adduced is that leading building companies in this country&mdash;supported by their industry organisations, which have taken a cut&mdash;have been involved in collusive tendering practices that have ripped off governments and clients of this industry for, to quote Gyles, `billions of dollars'. That invites a consideration that maybe there are matters here of criminality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What reduces this debate to a political farce, rather than a debate about serious national matters of how that money is to be recovered, is when the Premier of New South Wales, without notice to the Commonwealth, holds a press conference on the release of this report and does not mention at all in his press conference the fact that there has been this collusive tendering&mdash;not one word of it.

This Government, during my tenure in this post as Minister for Industrial Relations, acted immediately to clean up this industry and to gain the cooperation of the majority of the States and of the major industry participants, their organisations and the professions that support it in a set of principles that will achieve that. Do those opposite want me to declare my interest? That is my interest. That is the national interest and that is the interest of this industry, as it is of the economy and of all consumers of building and construction, be they home purchasers, investors in multi-storey construction or developers and proponents of major projects in this country. That is my interest and that is the record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators will find that record and that interest acclaimed, dare I say it, by all of the players who say to me constantly, `Thank God you did it, because it required the Government to take a strong stand to enforce a discipline upon this industry.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Gyles Royal Commission has served a great public duty in exposing collusive tendering practices which have cost, I think in this case the Commonwealth, millions of dollars. That is something we will obviously deal with.

The New South Wales Government thus far has not done so.

If there are other valuable elements of this Royal Commission, we will take them and fold them into our strategy because that will help us achieve the goal that we have set for ourselves.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Industrial Relations,</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Senator Cook, says that he takes his oath of office very seriously and that he is a good Minister. Yet this is the Minister who has told us untruths about Robe River, besmirched John Panizza and refused to apologise to them both. This is the man who, as Senator Parer said, took two hours to admit that he was a member of the BWIU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cook spoke at great length about the fact that he had declared his interest on a document. He asked honourable senators on this side of the chamber to sign the same document. What a nonsense! The document he has signed is one which he is required to sign because he is a Minister. The day I or anyone on this side of the chamber becomes a Minister, we will sign a similar document. In that document he is required to disclose whether he belongs to an organisation which may bring him into a position of conflict of interest. Clearly, the BWIU meets that category. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cook has disclosed it in that document, but then sought not to speak about it. I presume that he particularly did not want to tell the nation that he had been a former office-holder of the BWIU and that he still remained a member during Question Time because it is televised. He did not want to tell the Australian people that as a member of the BWIU, he is fostering and sponsoring legislation into this Parliament which will force independent contractors, against their will, to become members of&mdash;that is, pay money to&mdash;the organisation of which he was previously an official and  remains a member. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had a big discussion this morning about what constitutes a pecuniary interest. One matter that came before us this morning was the fact that the Australian Labor Party  is constructing a new building&mdash;said to be worth at least $80m&mdash;and has managed to secure for itself the Australian National Audit Office as a tenant. We are told that it is a lease that will run for 15 years, with a five-year option, and  indeed, that would mean that the Australian Labor Party will get $20m of taxpayers' money by way of the Australian National Audit Office paying rent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also had a discussion as to whether members of the Australian Labor Party therefore had a pecuniary interest in that lease because they will all benefit from that money by way of supporting their campaigns. If a Minister is to sign a document and disclose that he is a member of that union and that it is the source of possible future conflict, it is most important that he admit to it when he stands to answer a question on an inquiry into the building industry where the commissioner has said that the BWIU should be deregistered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cook stood up to try to defend his union and to damn other interests. It was very interesting that named in that inquiry on the employer side was someone that we have come to know very well in its association with Mr Symons and Senator Richardson&mdash;that is, Multiplex. It is a well-known player in Western Australia. It was represented at the famous lunch where money was sought for a donation to the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To say that it is all a rather incestuous affair would be putting it mildly. The Australian Labor Party, Multiplex and BWIU are now erecting a building of which we do not know the source of the funds. We do not even know who is building it, for that matter. One could almost say that the ALP is now securing a pipeline to the Mint with a guaranteed income of over $20m courtesy of the taxpayer. That is why my colleague Senator Crane sought leave to take note of the Minister's answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cook signed that document as a Minister of the Crown. If he takes his oath of office seriously, when responding to what was a dorothy dix question during Question Time, the Minister ought to have disclosed the fact that he was a former office-bearer of the BWIU and a continuing member of the BWIU. He propounds trade union policy very often in the guise of ministerial responsibility. Senator Crane was quite right to take note of that answer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I want to make a few comments in closing this debate. First, this debate need never have happened if Senator Cook had just said in answering the question, when he had the opportunity to do so, `I am a member of the BWIU'; that is all he had to say. The fact that he did not do that then but then took some two hours before he came back into this chamber and said it, makes one feel rather suspicious about the reasons why, when he was on television and people were watching, he would not say it then.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, Senator Cook said that I had concealed my membership, I presume, of various organisations. I refute that totally. It is a misrepresentation of the facts. I have not concealed my representation of various organisations. In fact, I highlight in particular that when the wool debate was on last year, I declared that I had an interest in it as a woolgrower and as a member of a grower organisation. It is absolute nonsense. I imagine that many other honourable members and senators of this Parliament have done similar things. Certainly in this case, when I did have an interest in a particular matter, I made it quite clear on the public record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My next point concerns why the Gyles report is so important when considering the two points that I raised in my opening comments. The first point was that there was no statement in terms of the dorothy dix question as to what either the Federal Government or Senator Cook, as Minister for Industrial Relations, would do about the Gyles report. However, there was a lot of advice to the building industry and the New South Wales Government as to what they should do about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Senator Cook came back in here, he said that the Government would treat the report seriously and that it would make some comment in the very near future. It is worth noting in terms of this debate and where the various interests lie, particularly in New South Wales, that, while we refer to the State branch of the BWIU, it must be recognised that most people involved in the building industry in New South Wales on the employee side are members of the Federal BWIU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The apologist&mdash;he came in here and walked out from the debate&mdash;for the Secretary of the ACTU and the BWIU referred to me as a coward. He challenged me to make certain comments outside this chamber which, if I were to make them, would be to my detriment. What on earth was he conjuring up in his mind about what I was going to say? He was trying to provoke me into saying something. He has employed typical union tactics&mdash;to which this country has been subjected for many years, particularly in the building industry&mdash;of intimidating people into doing things. I inform the Minister that I will not be intimidated into doing any of these particular things. If I want to say something, they will be my words out of my mouth; they will not be put in my mouth by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final reason why this issue is very important is that the subcontractors legislation will come before this Parliament next week. This legislation is fundamentally about the Troubleshooters case, which emanated from the case between the BWIU and Troubleshooters. That is what it is about. The linkage into declarations of interests and the position where people stand on that legislation is crucial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This episode would not have happened if the Minister had said in Question Time today the simple words, `I am a member of the BWIU'. He chose not to do so. He came in here fuming and jumping, with wrath coming out of his nostrils, purely and simply because he did not want the people of Australia to see him on television stating that he was a member of the BWIU. </PARA>

<PARA>In a dorothy dixer in Question Time today the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) chose to talk about a press release put out by a colleague, Mr Downer, on 21 May. The Minister left the very clear impression in the mind of the listener that Mr Downer was calling for an increase in defence spending. The Minister has indicated that he did not say that Mr Downer was calling for that, but he canvassed the press reports reporting Mr Downer's press release. As I represent Mr Downer in this place, it is important that I make it very clear exactly what Mr Downer was saying in his press release of 21 May. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Downer called on the Government to increase spending on the combat capability of Australia's Defence Force. He referred in his press release to the publication of an opinion poll which had been put out that day showing that Australians lacked confidence in our defence capability. They rightly have reason to be concerned about our defence capability because for nearly a decade the Government has been whittling away the combat capability of the Australian Defence Force. I say that very advisedly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Labor has made savings in defence, they have been made continually in the combat area. We have had the recent example of two out of our six regular infantry battalions being abolished. A couple of our major ships are tied up rather than the money being spent on taking them to sea. Year after year we have had continual reductions in the flying time for our Air Force. We have had reductions in the steaming time for our Navy. We have had exercises cancelled left, right and centre for our Army and the other services. We have also had a continual whittling away of the training days for the Army reserves. What has happened to the ability of the Army reserves to do the job they are called on to do is a matter for a speech all on its own. Whether we are talking about the regular forces or the reservists, this Government has always taken it out of the hide of the combat forces. We are in very real trouble when we have 6,768 days of unpaid service undertaken by Australia's reservists. That is what happened last financial year. It is continuing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition wants to make sure that the cuts that have to be made, because of the mismanagement of Australia's economy and because of the inability to currently spend more on defence, are made out of the tail. How can we justify in any way having 24,000 to 25,000 public servants servicing a defence force of under 68,000? The mind boggles. Yet successive Ministers for defence have refused to take the necessary action. If ever there was a case of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yes, Minister</EMPHASIS> it was when Minister Beazley received a joint parliamentary committee report. He got snowed quite clearly by his bureaucrats and was prepared to be snowed. He took no action on the recommendations of the Cross Committee back in 1986 or 1987. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This problem has continued. Every time we argue this case we hear the Minister of the day argue, as Minister Ray did today, that there have been cuts in the civilian component. There have not been substantial cuts. The Williamstown dockyard, for example, has been sold off to private enterprise so that those employees have gone off the Commonwealth payroll. Australian Defence Industries and AeroSpace Technologies of Australia have been established as corporations. Those employees have also gone off the Commonwealth payroll. Yet we are left with about 25,000 public servants to support a force of under 68,000. We believe that savings have to be made in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have only to look at the fact that $100m has been spent over a number of years on a totally unsuccessful mine countermeasures procurement program for the inshore minehunter. Even though the Government recognised that that was a tremendous and terrible waste of people's money, it allocated another $13m in the 1991-92 Budget. It is unbelievable that more money could have been thrown after bad when the Government had already finally admitted publicly that that project was a total and utter failure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until such time as we get a government that can make this economy prosper again, that can get things up and going again, we will not be able to spend more money on defence. Mr Downer was not suggesting that. We are spending about three times on social security what we are spending on the defence of the nation because nearly one million people are unemployed. That is why we cannot properly defend this country; that is why the combat capability has been run down. This Government has failed to grasp the nettle and to make the hard decisions which will mean getting rid of this heavy tail. The Government needs to reallocate resources within the Defence budget and make sure that Australia's defence capacity is enhanced. Currently, it is going in a totally wrong direction. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The document read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the information of Honourable Senators, I present the Government's response to the Report of the Senate Select Committee on Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals in Australia, which was tabled on 23 August 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I seek leave to make a statement on the Report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The use of chemicals in, the control of pests and diseases in plant and animal production, public hygiene and domestic use, is an important issue which is attracting increasing public attention both in Australia and overseas. This is clearly evident from submissions given to the Senate Select Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has noted that many of the submissions presented to the Senate Select Committee questioned farm chemical use and practice from a community health and environmental impact viewpoint. Nevertheless, the overall tenor of the Senate Select Committee's Report indicated that, in general, the controls over agricultural and veterinary chemicals are indeed sound, although there are community concerns and deficiencies in some areas which the report clearly identifies and which cannot be ignored. Farm chemical use has in the past been and continues to be carefully addressed by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before outlining the Government's response to the Report, I note that, the Senate Select Committee identified major deficiencies in the current clearance and registration arrangements including:  inadequate resources at federal level, duplication between the States, lack of a minor use program, and no substantial program to systematically review existing chemicals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has moved swiftly to overcome these areas of concern. With the strong support of the Australian Agricultural Council, the Australian Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Council and individual State Governments, the Commonwealth Government has decided to establish a national registration scheme for agricultural and veterinary chemicals and at the same time provide for:  a minor use program, a program of reviewing existing chemicals, and an upgrade of existing resources. The Government will provide an additional $6.2 million for these programs in 1992/93, with funding in future years to be determined following the review of the National Registration Scheme in 1993. Initially cost recovery will be 50 per cent of the scheme's user-attributable costs rising to 100 per cent over four years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is presently planned to have a national registration system in place by July 1992 and the minor use and review of existing chemical programs to commence in January 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To facilitate the implementation of the National Registration Scheme in a timely and efficient way, the Government established an eight member implementation team which is responsible to the Australian Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Council. This Council is comprised of representatives from:  the Commonwealth, the States, the Northern Territory, the National Health and Medical Research Council, the Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council, and Worksafe Australia. A consumer representative now also attends meetings of the Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government considered it important to firstly improve the basic regulatory process concerning the assessment and registration of agricultural and veterinary chemicals and to rationalise Commonwealth/State responsibilities in the area, before attempting to address issues of wider concern to Government and the general community. While establishing the National Registration Scheme for agricultural and veterinary chemicals has delayed responding to other recommendations, these recommendations can now be considered on the firm basis of the National Registration Scheme being established and with a clear vision of the future roles of the Commonwealth and States, not only in respect to registration matters but in other areas associated with the overall management of agricultural and veterinary chemicals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to addressing the state of clearance and registration of agricultural and veterinary chemicals in Australia, which is being responded to in a comprehensive way, the Senate Select Committee made significant recommendations in respect to:  alternative approaches to current chemical use practices, the integration of farm chemical use and alternative pest control methods, chemical container disposal, and aerial spraying.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Overall the Committee's Report provides a blueprint for the management of farm chemicals in agricultural production for the next decade.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In its examination of the Report's recommendations the Government is mindful of the importance of agricultural production to the Australian economy. During 1989/90 Australia's agricultural industries contributed 4 per cent of our Gross Domestic Product, provided 26 per cent of our much needed export income, and ensured domestic consumers had access to a variety of low cost, wholesome agricultural produce.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Farm chemicals play a vital role in Australian agricultural industries. It has been said that the contribution of the use of farm chemicals, over the last forty  years, ranks with those of farm mechanisation and the development of new varieties of plants and breeds of livestock, in increasing production and lowering the cost of agricultural produce.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Research reveals the substantial gains in production from the use of farm chemicals. Benefits accrue directly to primary producers through increased yields and greater reliability of production. Consumers gain through lower prices, better quality of produce and reliability of supply. The use of chemicals needs, however, to be in accordance with sound use practices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Excessive or inappropriate use of chemicals may adversely impact upon the environment and lead to excessive residue levels in agricultural commodities, resulting in a loss of consumer confidence in the regulatory system and the possible loss of valuable agricultural export markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The growing concerns of consumers and environmentalists suggest that if the substantial benefits deriving from the use of farm chemicals are to continue, the problems that do exist must be resolved to ensure continued public health and environmental protection and that the confidence of consumers, both domestic and international, in Australia's regulatory system is not only maintained but enhanced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate Select Committee direct 25 of its 45 recommendations to the Australian Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Council for further action and, where appropriate, implementation. The Government has every confidence in the Council's ability, as the prime body in Australia for the management of chemical issues, to address these recommendations in a timely and comprehensive manner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I must stress, however, that it is important to recognise that the resources available to meet the many tasks recommended by the Senate Select Committee are not infinite. While health, environmental, occupational safety and trade standards will not be allowed to decline in any way, some of the Committee's recommendations may be progressed at a pace that is commensurate with the economic restraint we need to exercise in these times.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">THE GOVERNMENT'S STRATEGY FOR THE NEXT DECADE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's strategy for handling the sensitive and highly complex farm chemical issue for the next decade consists of five major thrusts:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ensuring community confidence in the regulatory system;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">improving the administrative efficiency of the clearance and registration processes and their integration with programs monitoring the use of chemicals;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iii)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">developing a comprehensive approach to international and domestic aspects of farm chemicals;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iv)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">enhancing education and training in regard to chemical use; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(v)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">promoting alternative and integrated approaches to the use of chemicals in agriculture.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ENSURING CONSUMER CONFIDENCE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To continue to hold consumer confidence, the regulatory system  must not only be open, but be seen to be open, accessible, accountable and comprehensive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is of concern to the Government that submissions to the Senate Select Committee identified a range of issues which, if left unresolved, have the potential to undermine public confidence in the regulatory system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Issues identified include:  the need for consumer input into the deliberations of the Australian Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Council; inclusion of wider interests in the consultative process including farmers, manufacturers, unions, veterinarians and environmentalists; the lack of information on the regulatory process and on the significance of farm chemical residues in food; and the need for short summaries of toxicological assessments to be made available to the public.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Government sees no challenge more important than maintaining consumer confidence, it has already moved to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.have a senior officer of the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs attend meetings of the Australian Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Council;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.request the Australian Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Council to give priority to the publication and wide distribution of publications setting out details of the regulatory process and those agencies involved in it, and other information on farm chemicals;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.request Council to report on the feasibility of making available to the public short summaries of toxicological assessments;  and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">review existing chemicals through the National Registration Scheme to ensure health, safety and environmental standards are maintained at the highest level.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">IMPROVING THE ADMINISTRATIVE EFFICIENCY OF THE CLEARANCE AND REGISTRATION PROCESSES AND THEIR INTEGRATION WITH PROGRAMS MONITORING THE USE OF CHEMICALS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Several submissions to the Senate Select Committee noted that a system involving agricultural and veterinary chemical registration in each State and the Northern Territory was inefficient and confusing due to varying regulatory regimes. Other submissions criticised delays and administrative inefficiencies in the clearance process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Registration Scheme, which is consistent with the Government's microeconomic reform program, will eliminate duplication and improve the efficiency of service delivery by Commonwealth agencies. The States and Territories have embraced the objectives of the National Registration Scheme and significant progress in achieving this goal has already been made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both the Departments of Primary Industries and Energy, and Health, Housing and Community Services, have had management consultants independently review their respective procedures in the evaluation and clearance of agricultural and veterinary chemicals. The resulting reports recommended changes to improve administrative efficiency. Such changes would have beneficial resource implications. The Government is determined to ensure that improvements in the registration process continue to be implemented through an efficient and effective administrative framework. With this in mind, the Government has requested that a report on organisational form, along with proposals for funding mechanisms and charging policies associated with the National Registration Scheme, be brought forward to Cabinet in 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Registration Scheme will enhance the existing close liaison between areas of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy involved with agricultural and veterinary chemical issues. In particular, National Residue Survey administrators will have access to relevant information from a single authority on all products registered in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DEVELOPING A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC ASPECTS OF FARM CHEMICALS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has a detailed procedure for the evaluation and clearance of agricultural and veterinary chemicals before they are registered for use. The community, I feel, can have confidence in the present regulatory system and that, as in the past, any deficiencies will be responded to.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is totally committed to the National Residue Survey. The National Residue Survey has provided extensive information on the residue status of Australian food commodities since the early 1960's. A recommendation calling for the expansion of the Survey to more widely include food for domestic consumption, is being considered by the Standing Committee on Agricultural's Co-ordinating Committee on Agricultural Chemicals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This follows the Government's expansion of the Survey in 1987 in response to Australia's problems with organochlorine residues in meat for the United States market. Extensive measures continue to be taken to minimise farm chemical residues not only in export meat, but in other food commodities as well. An emphasis on the careful and cautious use of farm chemicals is essential to ensure the acceptability of Australian agricultural commodities in both domestic and highly competitive overseas markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">May I remind the Honourable Senators of a conclusion of the Australian Science and Technology Council Report titled, Health, Politics, Trade: Controlling Chemical Residues in Agricultural Products of March 1989, `that chemical residues are not an undue health hazard to consumers of Australian agricultural produce'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The results of the National Residue Survey and other residue monitoring programs, such as the Market Basket Survey, are widely distributed internationally, thereby highlighting to our trading partners that we can ably demonstrate the safety of our agricultural exports and food commodities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Chemical residues are not confined to food, they can also contaminate the environment. In the case of fisheries products, the boundary between environmental and food residues becomes rather indistinct. Such contamination is particularly characteristic of the persistent organochlorine insecticides, which have now been essentially withdrawn from agriculture. While modern pesticides generally have lower environmental impact because they are less persistent in the environment, there is still a need to understand how chemicals impact on wildlife and ecosystems, and to obtain data on levels of agricultural chemical residues in the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An area of particular concern to Commonwealth, State and Northern Territory regulatory authorities is the growing need for approved chemicals on minor crop and animal uses. The Government has decided to establish a national minor use program. In general, minor use situations occur where a farm chemical is used in a situation which is an extension of the crops permitted on the label but where the level of use does not provide the incentive for chemical manufacturers to seek approval. Such instances are often particularly important to developing horticultural industries. The absence of approved chemicals for use in minor crops does of course hinder development and expansion of new minor crop industries, many of which have significant export potential. It is hoped that the timely availability of chemical products and residue standards for minor crops will help to promote those industries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is aware of how quickly international and domestic circumstances surrounding the use of agricultural and veterinary chemicals can alter. The Committee's recommendation that a section be established within the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, to monitor overseas developments in the many facets of agricultural and veterinary chemicals, and to formulate strategic responses to emerging issues, will be considered.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ENHANCING EDUCATION AND TRAINING IN REGARD TO CHEMICAL USE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Increasing community concerns about potential environmental and health hazards associated with chemicals used on farms, in the home and in industrial situations, challenge the continuing use of such chemicals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These concerns are being addressed. In particular consumers will have available a greater range of information on farm chemicals, including information on how the regulatory system operates in Australia and how toxicological assessments are undertaken. Much of this material is under development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The occupational hazards associated with the use of farm chemicals has been and continues to be addressed by Worksafe Australia and the National Health and Medical Research Council. Data on the effect of occupational exposure to farm chemicals is also being compiled and may be used by regulatory authorities to further strengthen control measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is pleased to announce that the development of national standards for the training and licensing of pest control operators, recommended by the Senate Select Committee, is currently being undertaken. The Government has also supported the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Association's Accreditation Scheme. This Scheme involves the training of farm chemical retailers in the proper storage, handling and disposal of farm chemicals. This training will facilitate a flow of information in respect of farm chemicals from the manufacturers, through the retailers, to the end-user, who has a responsibility to be acutely aware of the hazards which may result from improper chemical use. Such hazards extend not only to end-users in an occupational sense, but also to their families, consumers and the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">PROMOTING ALTERNATIVE AND INTEGRATED APPROACHES TO THE USE OF CHEMICALS IN AGRICULTURE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The final report of the Ecologically Sustainable Development Working Group on Agriculture, while not detracting from the importance of farm chemicals, addresses in part alternative and integrated approaches to the use of chemicals in agriculture.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Working Group has addressed Integrated Pest Management as one strategy which through carefully controlled co-ordinated management combines, for example, the use of plant breeding for pest resistance, and biological control through preservation of natural enemies of pests, with minimum inputs of chemicals. Integrated Pest Management is already widely practiced in some agricultural industries and is being developed in other areas, especially in the citrus industry and in the control of mites on pome fruits. Apart from Integrated Pest Management strategies, Rural Industry Research and Development Corporations dealing with products such as:  cotton, rice, grapes, apples and pears, have long term research plans which  support research to reduce the use of chemicals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Biotechnology also offers the scope to reduce the use of chemicals. One aspect is the rapid development of agricultural commodities that are less susceptible to pest attack by identifying and exploiting particular resistant genes. In animal production, the development of several vaccines by the CSIRO, will also reduce the use of man-made chemicals for control of external and internal parasites.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are now biological control methods involving the introduction of other organisms to control particular pests or diseases. Paterson's curse, for instance, is now widely controlled by a particular type of moth. Several other agents for the control of Paterson's curse are under study and are expected to be released soon. Another example is the control of blackberry by the release of European blackberry rust, which is expected to have a major impact.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government recognises these strategies as part of an integrated approach to pest management. As elaborated in our detailed responses, the Government has given priority to the development of integrated pest management programs and research into biological control methods. Significant Government funding in these areas has already been provided. This priority will continue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Also the Government has provided support to the emerging organic farming sector. Assistance includes the establishment of the Organic Produce Advisory Committee to develop national standards and to provide advice on organically grown food. The Advisory Committee has already prepared national standards and farm certification procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In July 1990, a major study of domestic and international prospects for marketing organically grown food was released by the Government. This was in response to the increased interest shown by both domestic and international consumers to organically grown food.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CONCLUSION</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many of the Senate Select Committee's recommendations have been incorporated in the Government's strategy for farm chemicals for the next decade. It is a strategy based on concern for:  community health, environmental impact, occupational safety, and trade issues. It recognises the important role played by farm chemicals in one of Australia's most important economic sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I seek leave to have the Senate Select Committee's recommendations and the Government's response incorporated in Hansard. Also, I have taken the opportunity in developing the Governments response to address the recommendations of the Australian Science and Technology Council Report titled, Health, Politics, Trade:  Controlling Chemical Residues in Agricultural Products, of March 1989, which are closely related to the Senate Select Committee's recommendations.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GOVERNMENT RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As Australia accepts the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) Code of Conduct on the Distribution and Use of Pesticides and has indicated acceptance of Prior Informed Consent under the provisions of the Code it is unnecessary to amend the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act 1988 to provide for the compulsory provision of information to governments of countries to which Australia exports pesticides.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Code requires Australia to provide advice to the FAO on pesticides which have been banned or severely restricted, thus facilitating countries being advised in an internationally co-ordinated manner.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Information is being sought on the best way to apply label design principles to produce improvement in user understanding of label instructions by changes to label format, use of pictograms etc. Persons will be consulted who are experienced in communication and familiar with the laws relating to: labelling, packaging, weights, and measures requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will also be consultation with Dangerous Goods Enforcement bodies. This will ensure that labelling requirements, under the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act 1988, are consistent with those laid down in The Australian Code for the Transport of Dangerous Goods by Road and Rail.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Concerns about public understanding of hazards of chemicals used in the home environment, have led the National Health and Medical Research Council to give priority to the development of a national plan for the domestic use of chemicals and poisons, with the objective of reducing the incidence of poisoning. A national survey has been undertaken in order to establish a baseline of data on:  public awareness, and attitude to and behaviour to chemicals in the home, including compliance with safety directions and warning statements on current labelling and packaging of scheduled chemicals.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GOVERNMENT RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NHMRC at its 100th Session in November 1990 agreed that the most appropriate mechanism for establishing a database on poisoning by domestic chemicals, including agricultural chemicals, was the inclusion of poisoning data in the Injury Surveillance Information System being developed by the National Injury Surveillance Unit. It was agreed that the Australian Institute of Health be requested to consider the establishment of a poisoning data collection process within this system as a priority initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Worksafe Australia is collecting statistics on work injuries and diseases on farms under its Farm Safety Initiative&mdash;Farmsafe.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee RECOMMENDS that the Ministers for Primary Industries and Energy and Community Services and Health review resources, including personnel, to ensure that the evaluation of agricultural and veterinary products is carried out expeditiously.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GOVERNMENT RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government agreed, on 2 August 1991, to establish the National Registration Scheme for agricultural and veterinary chemicals. The establishment of a national system for the registration of agricultural and veterinary chemicals encapsulates extensive consultation with the Australian Agricultural Council, the Australian Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Council and individual States. When implemented a national registration scheme will replace the eight State and Territory Registration bodies, thereby creating a single point of contact for industry, government agencies and overseas governments. A single authority will provide for greater efficiency and allow the implementation of uniform requirements across Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In introducing the National Registration Scheme, the Government has taken the opportunity to implement a national approach to the approval of chemicals for minor crop and animal uses. Also the introduction of a more formal and intensive program for the review of existing agricultural and veterinary chemicals which are of concern for health or environmental reasons will be subject to review under the new arrangements. Resources for the existing clearance of agricultural and veterinary chemicals in the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services, have been increased following independent consultants' reports. Resources for Worksafe Australia and DASET have also been increased in-line with their involvement in the clearance process. The result will be improved efficiency and effectiveness of the clearance process. The total cost of implementing the National Registration Scheme is estimated to be $5.5 million in 1991/92 and $9.9 million in 1992/93. Funding in future years will be determined following a review to be undertaken in 1993. Initially cost recovery will be 50% of the scheme's user-attributable costs rising to 100% over four years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the Government's intention to have a national system for registering agricultural and veterinary chemicals in place by July 1992. The approval of chemicals for minor uses and review of existing agricultural and veterinary chemicals is planned to commence in January 1993.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee RECOMMENDS that the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce consider establishing a scheme, similar to that applying to human pharmaceuticals, to enable the patent term of agricultural and veterinary chemical products to be extended.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GOVERNMENT RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government examined the case for extending the patent period for agricultural and veterinary chemicals during passage of the Patent Amendment Act 1989. It concluded that there was no substantive reason to change the patent period for this class of chemicals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In considering this recommendation there does not appear to be any significant reason to warrant changing the earlier decision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Proprietary Rights to Registration Data</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RECOMMENDATION 27</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee RECOMMENDS that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy should not accept the proposal of the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Association for recognition of proprietary rights to registration data presented to the inquiry. Nevertheless, the Committee recommends that the Department of Primary Industries and Energy continue discussions with the farm chemical industry and rural organisations in order to identify alternative proposals that would resolve conflicting views on proprietary rights to registration data.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GOVERNMENT RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Primary Industries and Energy is continuing discussions with the farm chemical industry and rural organisations, concerning proprietary rights to registration data. In particular the discussions have focused on proprietary rights to additional scientific data generated at the request of the proposed national registration body.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is anticipated that this approach to proprietary rights will facilitate the production of data for out of patent products which are included in the review of existing agricultural and veterinary chemicals. The full implications of the introduction of proprietary rights to registration data will be considered as part of the implementation of the national registration scheme for agricultural and veterinary chemicals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">EFFICACY OF AGRICULTURAL AND VETERINARY CHEMICALS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RECOMMENDATION 28</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee RECOMMENDS that the Australian Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Council, in consultation with industry and rural groups, examine maximum use provisions and the implications of using other than label rates. This examination should include consideration of a national permit system to document variations of label rates thus providing a database to allow existing label rates to be amended.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GOVERNMENT RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AAVCC will examine maximum use provisions with a view to providing information upon which decisions on a lower rate than that stipulated on the label can be made. This initiative is consistent with the objectives of sustainable agriculture.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whether rates different from label rates are of benefit depends on factors such as impact on resistance and need for follow-up applications. The benefits of different rates needs to be determined by trials and/or scientific studies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A national permit system is unlikely to be useful either in determining the extent of variations from label rates or in determining whether changes in label rate are desirable. This is because of the infinite number of possible rates below the maximum rates and the various conditions under which products are used.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GOVERNMENT RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government sees education and training as the key to  responsible and judicious use of agricultural and veterinary chemicals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The education and training of users of agricultural and veterinary chemicals could be expected to improve occupational health and safety and lead to more professional handling practices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rural industry, through the National Farmers' Federation and the Rural Industry Training Council of Australia, has recognised education and training as a priority and has received a grant of $70,000 from Worksafe Australia to develop a national accreditation system for chemical users on farms. The needs of non-English speaking users of chemicals will also be addressed in education and training programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Worksafe Australia has instigated a number of programs to improve occupational health and safety. These include developing an occupational health and safety resource manual for Farm Safety Action Groups. The resource manual will provide information and preventive strategies for the wide range of hazards found on farms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has also been recognised that rural women have a significant role to play in the safe and responsible use of agricultural and veterinary chemicals. This is reflected in the material in the resource manual and also in the provision of an Occupational Health and Safety grant for the development of education and training material on occupational health and safety issues for rural women.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals in Australia, I wish to make some comments on the Government's response to the Committee's report. As honourable senators will recall, the Select Committee was established to inquire into and report on three broad areas relating to agricultural and veterinary chemicals. These were: the adequacy of Commonwealth legislative and administrative arrangements, the efficacy of pest management systems and the economic, social and environmental impact of agricultural and veterinary chemicals. The inquiry received 256 submissions and generated nearly 6,000 pages of evidence. The Committee's unanimous report, which was tabled in July 1990, made 45 recommendations and reached 18 major conclusions on a range of issues and concerns relevant to its terms of reference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased that the Government's response recognises the valuable work done by this Committee. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Committee's report provides a blueprint for the management of farm chemicals in agricultural production for the next decade.</PARA>
<PARA>Time will not permit me to address all of the matters raised in the Government response. However, there are five responses to recommendations which I would like to draw to the attention of the Senate this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, the Government has accepted the Committee's recommendation concerning the need for a national system of clearance and registration. In August 1991, it agreed to establish a national registration scheme for agricultural and veterinary chemicals. This scheme replaces the eight State and Territory registration bodies and creates a single point of contact for industry, government agencies and overseas governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As recognised by the Select Committee in its report, a single authority will eliminate unnecessary duplication of laws and procedures, reduce associated costs, provide for greater efficiency and result in a uniform approach to regulation. The national registration scheme will also include three programs identified by the Select Committee. These are a minor use program, a program of reviewing existing chemicals and an upgrading of existing resources. I note that the Government will provide an additional $6.2m for these programs in 1992-93. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the Select Committee recognised that the regulatory system for agricultural and veterinary chemicals must be open, accessible and accountable and must be seen to be so. During the Committee's inquiry this system was described as a `closed shop' and as `secretive'. In its response, the Government recognises that the perceptions noted by the Select Committee have the potential to undermine public confidence in the regulatory system. Accordingly, the Government has responded positively to the Committee's recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, the Government has arranged for a senior officer of the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs to represent consumer interests on the Australian Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Council. The Government has requested that the Council report on the feasibility of making available to the public short summaries of toxicological assessments. The Government has accepted the Committee's recommendation that the views of the wider community need to be heard in the regulatory system. I note that the Government is considering a range of options for advisory mechanisms, including the establishment of an agricultural and veterinary chemicals consultative committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the Government has endorsed the Committee's conclusion that, although agricultural and veterinary chemicals contribute significantly to the production of quality food and fibre, their use should not be seen as pre-eminent or exclusive but rather as an important tool in an integrated approach to pest management. Accordingly, the Government has established sustainability as a fundamental goal for all of the research and development corporations established under the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government endorses the Committee's view that there is a need to foster research on pest management systems that reduce dependence on pesticides by integrating the use of biological, chemical, cultural and physical control methods within sustainable production systems. I also note that over the last two years the Government has responded positively to several Committee recommendations concerning the production and marketing of organic produce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, in response to the Select Committee's recommendation, the Government is developing national standards for the training and licensing of pest control operators. I welcome this response as evidence presented to the Select Committee showed that there was concern about various aspects of the pest control industry, the operators of which treat buildings and domestic residences for termites, cockroaches and other pests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fifthly, in response to considerable concerns expressed in evidence, the Committee recommended that the National Health and Medical Research Council conduct a full review of the persistent organochlorin compounds used in Australia in order to reassess whether their continued use is justified on public health grounds. The Government's response indicates that an NHMRC working party has conducted a review of organochlorins and a draft report was released in January 1992 for public comment. I understand that a final report will be considered by the NHMRC later this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the Government response is welcome, I must record a degree of disappointment regarding the response to the Committee's recommendations on aerial spraying. I remind the Senate that it was the unanimous view of the Select Committee that widespread concerns about aerial applications of chemicals could not be discounted and must be allayed by stricter regulatory action and enforcement procedures. In particular, the Committee expressed the view that there was an urgent need for the development of a uniform, national approach to the regulation of aerial spraying of agricultural chemicals. I am pleased to note that in its response, the Government agrees with this view. Nevertheless, I am disappointed that after two years the matter is still being reviewed by the working parties of relevant agencies. I am sure that aerial spraying continues to be a concern to many people and I urge the Government to address this issue urgently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I would like to make a gen<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> eral observation about the Select Committee's inquiry. I consider that the inquiry provided a valuable forum for those with informed and considered views on agricultural and veterinary chemicals and their use in Australia. To the credit of those concerned, evidence to the Committee did not reflect intransigent views. On the whole, the evidence attempted to reconcile rather than perpetuate differing points of view, focusing on new approaches and the need for more to be done. This cooperative and constructive approach is reflected not only in the Committee's report but also in the Government's response that we are considering today. I encourage consumer and community groups, the chemical industry, primary producers and Government to maintain a similar positive and constructive approach when considering and acting upon issues that arise in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Select Committee concluded that agricultural and veterinary chemicals contribute significantly to the production of food and fibre but it is essential that they be used judicially and effectively. In this regard, I quote from a submission which succinctly reflected the views of many people who use agricultural and veterinary chemicals. The submission stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Farmers want to use safe products, want to produce clean and safe food and want to leave the environment in better shape.</PARA>
<PARA>I consider that the policies and strategies included in the Government's response to the Select committee's report will achieve these goals. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second example relates to a one-income family with three children: one at university, one in year 12 and one in year 10. They are all eligible for Austudy at the dependant rate. With the father earning $32,000, that family will be $100 worse off. I understand that under the provisions of regulation 23, the family will in fact receive nothing. So if my arithmetic is correct, they will be in fact $200 worse off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Case three illustrates what will happen if the father referred to in example two works any overtime. For every $100 in overtime he earns, a total of $114.25 in family income will go to the Government. I would like the Senate to focus on that point&mdash;if the father in example two works any overtime, for every $100 he earns a total of $114.25 in family income will go back to the Government. If the mother of that family gets a part time job and earns $10,000 to pay the bills, the mortgage and so forth, of that $10,000, $9,924 will go back to the Government. This is the sort of bind that these regulations are getting us into. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These examples illustrate some of the negative effects of the new Austudy regulations which the Government says are just simplifying the regulations. These regulations are grossly inequitable. Regulations which entrench this inequity must be removed. Such regulations are a further erosion of the principle of horizontal tax equity for families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want the Opposition, the Government and the Australian Democrats to realise that this question of horizontal tax equity is very important. Clearly, a family with three, four, five or six children, in receipt of whatever level of income, should get better treatment in the tax area than a family without children. In the area of education, families with children should be treated at least as well as businesses. Families on $32,000 or $36,000&mdash;they are not vast amounts&mdash;have to pay substantial amounts of money if they have a few kids going to university. They cannot even claim these amounts as a tax deduction at the end of the year. Yet, if a company sends its employees to university, that company can claim those expenditures as a tax deduction. To my way of thinking, that is patently unfair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regulation 30 omits regulation 89 of the principal Austudy regulations. Regulation 89 contained the formula for application of what was known as the sibling concession. It was not really a concession at all. Its purpose was to ensure that families with more than one child on Austudy were not penalised by losing more for every extra dollar earned by the mother or father. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sibling concession operated in the following manner. This example, which is taken from a footnote in the regulations, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Michael and his sister, Vanessa, both qualify for AUSTUDY. Normally Michael's AUSTUDY would be reduced by $1 for every $4 by which his parents' income exceeds $19,300. However, because regulation 89(1) applies to Vanessa, Michael's AUSTUDY is reduced by $1 for every $8 of excess parental income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Later, Michael's younger brother Ashley turns 16. Because regulation 89(1) applies to Ashley, Michael's AUSTUDY is now reduced by $1 for every $12 of excess parental income.</PARA>
<PARA>Because of the relevance of the brother or the sister, the payment for Michael was reduced only on a 1 : 8 basis, not 1 : 4, as in the instance of a sole recipient. The total reduction for the family remains, however, at 1 : 4; where there are two children, it is a ratio of 1 : 8. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regulation 89 removed&mdash;which I am seeking to amend&mdash;families with sibling students are entitled, through a revised regulation 87, to apply a general and non-sibling specific dependent student deduction of $3,700 for each additional dependent child in a family aged 16 to 24 engaged in full time study. Previously, through the operation of regulation 87(1)(c)(ii), the children were precluded from the provisions of this regulation. At the same time, regulation 29 has increased the amount of parental income that can be received before the reduction in Austudy entitlements come into play from $19,300 to $20,700. This brings the Austudy threshold into line with the threshold for the maximum FAS payable for one child. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only will families who received Austudy last year be affected in the amounts they receive but also there will be a group of new applicants this year who will be completely ineligible. It should be remembered that the so-called middle income family with more children can mean a lower income per family member than is the case for a lower income family with fewer children. Relative poverty is measured not by income alone but by income in relation to those who are dependent thereon. We should have our tax system geared to ensure that taxes are levied on income consistent with the number of dependants on that income. That would certainly be a far fairer situation than at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now proceed to an explanation of regulation 23. I will explain why I seek the disallowance of that particular regulation. Regulation 23 says in effect that Austudy payments of less than $250 per year are not worth having. That is a value judgment that apparently the Government has come to. Regulation 23 alters regulation 66 of the principal regulations to read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Living allowance is not payable if a student would be entitled to living allowance at a rate of less than $250&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>previously $50 a year&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(including the spouse allowance under regulation 64).</PARA>
<PARA>In 1991 a House of Representatives committee referred to students who receive very small weekly amounts and recommended an increase in the minimum allowance. But the committee appeared to view the payment more in terms of the impact of the monetary amount on decisions to continue education rather than in terms of the justice of the receipt of an amount, however small. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation of families with more than one dependent student was not taken into account when the Government interfered with the minimum amount of allowance payable. Regulation 66 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Living allowance is not payable if a student would be entitled to. . .</PARA>
<PARA>It does not say `if students in a family' or, `the total payment to a family is'. Under the new system we might therefore find that payments to a family with three children total slightly under $750. Under the new regulation&mdash;which I am seeking to disallow&mdash;the family would receive nothing. The almost $750 would be gone. Yet, $741 to a family with three full time students would come in very handy indeed, particularly when it is understood that Austudy is based on the premise that in most cases either the parents or the students themselves are expected to contribute substantially to their upkeep. I defy anybody to see the logic in the Government's new regulation 23. It is a nonsense. The more children one has the more ludicrous is this regulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, the concept of a relatively large minimum amount payable has not been introduced in any other area of Government payments. In the social security area, for example, all people who are entitled to a nominal amount&mdash;whether it be family allowance or whatever&mdash;which is above 5c but below $1 per fortnight, have their entitlement rounded upwards to $1 per fortnight. Honourable senators should focus on the fact that there is no precedent for this. In the case of the payment of the Job Search allowance, the Social Security Act states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If, apart from the section, the amount of an instalment would be less than $1.00, the amount is to be increased to $1.00.</PARA>
<PARA>Regulation 23 should be disallowed. As I indicated, for a family with three eligible students the minimum would be $750. A minimum of $250 per student this year might become $500 next year, or $1,000 the year after, or $2,000 the year after that. We are setting a precedent here which should not be set. We are allowing the Government to get away with this and it should not be allowed to get away with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The denial in minimum payments also removes eligibility for fares allowance. That is very important for country people to remember. Country people will be greatly affected by this regulation; quite a large number of people will be affected by it. When the Minister replies, I would like him to tell the Senate how many families have received reductions as a result of regulation 30 and how many families have been cut off altogether as a result of the operation of the new regulation 23. All of this material is computerised so I am sure that it would not be terribly hard to find out. I think it would be very interesting for the Senate to hear from the Government just what has been the effect of the new regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appeal to the Senate to give proper and due consideration to my remarks and to vote for the disallowance of regulation 23 and regulation 30.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition readily accepts the procedure that would divide the two matters for determination in the Senate. The Opposition is also very sensitive to questions of equity on the edges of a means test when it applies to any benefit to a family or, as in this case, to students in a family or independent of a family.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to a number of dependants within the same family, where siblings are enrolled and there is a greater call upon the resources of the family, the Opposition is also very sensitive to the needs of the family and siblings. But wherever the line is drawn, and whatever the withdrawal rate of a benefit according to the family's increasing income, or the withdrawal rate with regard to a minimum rate of Austudy allowance, we have to face the fact that a line has to be drawn and that we need to consider whether it is reasonable and equitable to draw the line where it falls. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The regulations tabled in the Senate which make adjustments to the Austudy regulations governing the payments of Austudy are new in the two respects to which Senator Harradine has referred. Another new aspect of these regulations that was debated yesterday related to penalty payments now, leading to 20 per cent interest accruing if overpayments are not repaid after a period of three months.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition gave careful consideration to that matter yesterday and I gave a rather too long speech about the question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also gave me the chance to state the very positive reforms to Austudy which would benefit all students in Australia that the Liberal and National parties will introduce when elected to government in the coming months. Having made that clear, I also took the opportunity yesterday to refer to what I call the `bleeding heart' context in which the Democrats were prepared to give any amount of allowance to be popular with some students. I do not need to repeat that. Senator Sowada heard me yesterday and I am sure that the Australian public knows that the Democrats will never have to deliver on their luxurious over-promises to students and to many other groups in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter which I need not refer to is the Chapman report on Austudy&mdash;a major inquiry into the Austudy scheme&mdash;of which we received copies yesterday. I am happy to note that in most respects the Chapman report parallels the published policies of reform for Austudy for which we have been calling for some years. There are options in the report, some of which are very close to options to which the Liberal and National parties wish to give very careful consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I will concentrate the remainder of my remarks directly on the two regulations that concern Senator Harradine and which have led to his motion&mdash;regulation 23 and regulation 30. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other introductory matter to which I want to refer relates to tax deductions for educational expenses. Senator Harradine has made the point in the Senate and to me privately&mdash;a point that must gain the attention of all honourable senators&mdash;that there is a lack of equity, on the face of it, in a company having a tax deduction in respect of education expenses for one of its employees but a family not being able to claim a tax deduction for the same expense for a student dependant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further anomaly relates to self-education expenses. If a person over the age of 25&mdash;or any independent person over the age of 18, for that matter&mdash;earns an income and is undertaking part time study, that person is able to claim a tax deduction for self-education expenses, up to a limit. There is a question of equity to be determined between those three cases, and I and my colleagues in the Opposition will give consideration to that. Of course, that matter is not directly before us in regard to the two matters that are the subject of Senator Harradine's motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the Opposition's position in regard to the minimum rate of Austudy. We accept the Government's regulation changing the minimum rate of Austudy living allowance from $50 a year last year to $250 a year this year. The effect of the regulation is to limit Austudy eligibility to those people who are in need. No-one is saying that more needy students are being denied by the change. It is those people in least need&mdash;that is, those with the minimum payment&mdash;who are being cut off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For most of the last 19 years about 35 per cent of enrolled full time students received Austudy, and before Austudy the tertiary education assistance allowance. At the moment that percentage is close to 50 per cent. There has been an increase in the proportion of full time students who are gaining Austudy benefits. The drawing back from 50 per cent to perhaps 48 per cent by this new regulation will still leave a much larger proportion of students receiving Austudy than has been the case for most of the last 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some $1.2 billion is spent on Austudy each year. The change in the regulation is estimated to save $21m&mdash;a very small amount. As I said at the outset, it is a consideration of where the lines ought to be equitably drawn in the cut-off between those students who receive Austudy and those students who do not. Instead of about 50 per cent of students receiving Austudy, this change will mean that about 48 per cent will receive it. Under the previous regulations students were eligible to receive as little as 96c per week in Austudy benefits. Traditionally, it has not been worth the administrative cost to give a student 96c a week, therefore the concept of a minimum payment has been introduced for Austudy. The effect of the change will be to raise the minimum benefit payable to about $4.81 a week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minimum threshold set by regulation 23 is, in fact, well below that recommended by the report on student financial assistance issued by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training in March last year. The Committee believed that $20 a week ought to be the minimum payment. That view was expressed by both Liberal and Labor members of that Committee, which looked very carefully at Austudy. The Committee actually recommended in March last year that the minimum payment be $20 a week. What we have seen is a shift from 96c a week to $4.81 a week as the minimum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition in its proposed reforms of Austudy has said that not only does it wish to increase the rate by 6 per cent but also to ensure that Austudy benefits, which have not been well managed by this Government, are targeted to students most in need. Bruce Chapman, in the most recent Austudy review, made the observation that perhaps only 25 per cent of students receiving Austudy would not have continued with their tertiary enrolment for the lack of that allowance. I do not want to argue that we should be quite ruthless in cutting back Austudy, but Bruce Chapman has said on numerous occasions in his report that the present Austudy arrangements are not well targeted. Surely the Australian people want any benefits that are going to students to be targeted to those who are most in need; we need to be convinced that Austudy is going to those students most in need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is certainly the principle of the Opposition. The Liberal and National parties believe that Austudy must ensure that not one student eligible to enrol in Australia will be denied enrolment for lack of financial means. We must ensure that all eligible students who win a place in higher education, in TAFE colleges and in schools are able to continue with that educational opportunity and not be denied for lack of finance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to regulation 30, which relates to the traditional sibling allowance. It is true that for some 18 years, until last December, there was a quite generous arrangement for Austudy to be paid to families of quite high incomes if more than one dependent student in that family was enrolled in a course of tertiary study. In fact, if a number of siblings were enrolled in tertiary study at the same time, a family could be earning more than $100,000 a year and still qualify. The income figure I have is $102,747 where there are two eligible siblings in a family. Under the special allowance, those siblings would receive some Austudy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am well informed&mdash;the Minister may be able to confirm this one way or the other&mdash;what the eventual cut-off point is under one or other allowance.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me quickly give the Opposition's view about this matter. The effect of the change in regulation 30 is to substantially reduce the amount of Austudy payable to students with siblings over 16 in full time study. But the effect of the disallowance of regulation 30 would be to reinstate the previous sibling concession without removing the new deduction of $3,700 for eligible siblings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, if we were to pass Senator Harradine's motion to disallow regulation 30, not only would the old sibling rate be retained&mdash;the very generous one that I have described&mdash;but there would also be an additional $3,700 deduction in relation to the family income for the purposes of the means test. So there would be an even greater generosity extended were this motion to be passed here today. The Opposition does not agree with that, and that is another reason why we are opposed to the disallowance of regulation 30. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Students applying for standard or away from home rates under Austudy are subject to an income test on their parents' or guardians' income, as we well know, and independent students are not. The measure of adjusted family income, or AFI, is well defined in the regulations. If the AFI exceeds the amount set out in the means test, a reduced allowance is payable. For every $4 by which the AFI exceeds the $19,300 limit, the allowance payable to the Austudy applicant is reduced by $1, and for the normal Austudy allowance this cuts out at an income of $34,561. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not need to go over all of the mathematics. But I note that the new arrangement, whereby in addition to the deductions for dependent siblings an additional amount of $3,700 is deducted for each eligible sibling, is still a means of calculating the Austudy allowance which gives direct regard to the additional costs of there being more than one student in one family. As a result, we still have in place a cut-off, or a means test, which means that, on the basis of the graphs that Senator Harradine has tabled for the normal Austudy rate of allowance, at many points there is some similarity, and very little difference, in the rates of Austudy that would be received, and the biggest cuts are at the highest incomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we have a blow-out in the mismanaged Budget of this Labor Government of nearly $10 billion&mdash;it may turn out by the end of this financial year to be $12 billion, and I see my colleagues in the chamber expressing concern at the mismanagement of the Labor Government with regard to the blow-out of the deficit&mdash;when we have massive unemployment of 12 per cent and for young people more than 30 per cent, when we have every kind of loss, suffering and stringency affecting the people of Australia, when difficulties are being compounded day by day under the Labor Government, it is the responsibility of all of us to take into account this kind of reduction in what had been a very generous concession, namely, the sibling allowance under Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, when we come into government and when prosperity returns to Australia we will give consideration to seeing what can be done to make a number of improvements to Austudy in addition to those that we have already announced. But, in the present circumstances, and noting that this regulation is estimated to save, as I understand it, only $3m, the Opposition supports the Government regulation and does not support the disallowance motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Teague and Senator Harradine for their contribution to this debate. In particular, I thank Senator Harradine for drawing the Senate's attention once again to the inadequacies of the Austudy scheme. The intent of his disallowance motion today is to reinstate the old method of calculating the sibling concession and disallow the regulation relating to the minimum benefit payable under Austudy. The Australian Democrats will not be supporting the disallowance of regulation 30. However, we will be supporting that part of the motion which relates to the disallowance of regulation 23.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Austudy benefits abate at a rate of $1 for every $4 above the parental income threshold of $28,700 and cut out above $33,000 and $49,000. Previously, families with more than one dependent child aged 16 or over were entitled to the sibling concession which reduced Austudy by $1 for every $4 multiplied by the number of brothers and sisters. In the case of two dependent siblings, Austudy is reduced by $1 for every $8 in excess parental income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's new means of calculating the sibling concession reduces the parental income by $3,700 for each dependent child. This dependent student deduction is aimed at better targeting those families in need. The previous method was of particular benefit to larger families. However, it also benefited families with high incomes, as Senator Teague has already pointed out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parental income threshold could be as high as $100,000 for a family of three students before benefits cut out. Senator Harradine's motion would also allow, as Senator Teague has pointed out, for the existence of two separate means of calculating the sibling concession, as the old and new methods would coexist. Those who would be greatly assisted would be those families on very high incomes. In addition, this would have a very considerable financial impact. We understand that the net effect could be as high as $20m per annum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government option does offer additional benefits to parents whose combined income is just below the income threshold. Larger low income families will benefit from the dependent student deduction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Teague has pointed out, the Chapman report reaffirms the need for better targeting of Austudy. I am very pleased to see that, as was not the case in the debate yesterday, Senator Teague has now had a chance to read the Chapman report and assess many of its recommendations in detail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Chapman report offers a broad range of options&mdash;not recommendations but options for change which, basically, are all things to all people. I am sure that every student, every education policy maker and every political party in this place could find something in those recommendations which they would like to see implemented in policy. But it is worth remembering that, in respect of the importance of Austudy in ensuring equity and participation in higher education, DEET's own research has indicated that as much as 50 per cent of its client base could not continue in higher education if it was not for Austudy. Further research conducted by DEET has indicated that as many as 33 per cent of those parents who are receiving Austudy in respect of secondary students could likewise not survive if it was not for those payments.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we can see that there is already a significant acceptance of Austudy as a means of ensuring access and equity and of ensuring that those people on low incomes are not disadvantaged in the education system by financial barriers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Getting back to the disallowance and the regulations that are the subject of this motion, I do not necessarily believe that the options we have before us today are the most effective options for providing for those most in need. However, I recognise that in respect of the sibling concession we must decide between two options, and the regulation proposed by the Government is more appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have made many references today to the inequities in the Austudy scheme. I take this opportunity to reiterate my objection to any erosion in the value of grants and to the replacement of grants with loans. We have also come out and opposed the mix and match loans grant scheme as outlined in the Chapman report because we believe that many students, by virtue of financial hardship, would have to turn to a loan in order to continue to finance their studies. It simply highlights, from our point of view, the poor value that students get out of an Austudy grant. It simply does not meet their living costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I do congratulate the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services, Mr Baldwin, on his rejection yesterday of the compulsory loans. I would like him to go one step further in ensuring that loans are not used in the long term as a replacement of Austudy. I think it is vitally important for the student movement to be reassured of that. I cannot help but feel that the Minister responded to the urgency of the day, being the national day of action on Austudy, and that his intention was to placate the student movement and not to commit himself to any real reform of the Austudy scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contrary to Senator Teague's accusations yesterday, the Australian Democrats have a clear and rational understanding of budgetary constraints. In this case we have recognised that we are faced with a choice between two methods of determining a concession. We have to decide what is most effective in targeting Austudy and what is the most economical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other part of Senator Harradine's motion for disallowance relates to regulation 23. The Australian Democrats will be supporting the disallowance of this regulation which seeks to increase the minimum amount of Austudy payable from $50 per year to $250 per year. An amount slightly below the level of $250 can represent a considerable amount of money for students and families when considered as a lump sum. As Senator Harradine has already pointed out, the Government considers that amounts less than $250 are just not worth having, but under this new regulation a family with three dependent students on Austudy who may have previously qualified for an amount of $200 per annum each would miss out on an amount of $600 per annum, which is not an inconsiderable amount of money for a struggling middle income family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Harradine has also rightly indicated that this punitive measure is not contained in any other form of social security legislation and in addition will result in the loss of fares allowances for students, which will be a particular burden on country students and especially on urban students who have to travel great distances to their place of education. In my home town of Sydney that is very much the case with campuses spread wide and far across Sydney and with students often having to travel considerable distances in order to reach their institution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We recognise, however, the Government's very real attempt to streamline the administration of Austudy by implementing regulation 23. The administration costs of dealing with a minimum payment of $50 per annum which, as Senator Teague has indicated, could amount to as little as 96c per week must be enormous. However, I ask the Government whether it would not perhaps be preferable to adopt in cases like this a method of lump sum payment for small amounts&mdash;amounts below $250. In our view, for larger families especially, an amount of just below $250 per annum is a considerable amount of money. While in Austudy terms it may not be a great deal and may not amount to more than $5 per week, a lump sum amount of, say, $200 per annum is sufficient to buy a large number of text books, stationery and material essential to students' education. So I put it to the Government that, rather than instituting this punitive regulation, perhaps it would be preferable to institute a system of lump sum payment of Austudy for amounts that fall below $250. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our view, this is yet another punitive measure instituted by this Government which will specifically hurt families with a large number of students at university and school. We commend this aspect of the motion for disallowance to the Senate. I have already indicated to Senator Harradine that we will be supporting that aspect of the motion should he seek to call a division. However, we will not be supporting that part of the motion which relates to the sibling concession. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having made those remarks, however, the Government is still of the opinion that these regulations should not be disallowed, that we should proceed. The Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services, Mr Baldwin, has provided me with some fairly copious notes that he would like drawn to the attention of the Senate, and I propose to do that. But much of my thunder has been stolen, peculiarly enough, by Senator Teague who has made an excellent contribution to this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of Austudy is, of course, to provide financial assistance to students from needy families to enable them to continue further study. Maximum benefits are generally targeted to students from families with a combined taxable income of $20,700 or less. Yearly benefits abate by $1 for every $4 above $20,700, cutting out at parental income levels between $33,000 and $49,000. Of course, that depends on the student's age and the circumstances of the student. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past, the abatement rates for families with more than one student child aged 16 or over was more generous than that for families with one such child. This was known as the sibling concession. For a family with three children in full time education, partial Austudy could be payable in certain circumstances on a parental income of over $100,000. Payment of Austudy to families at such income levels was not consistent with the objectives of the scheme, that is, to assist in overcoming financial barriers to post-compulsory education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Student Financial Assistance</EMPHASIS>, completed in March of last year, was critical of the fact that families on high incomes could benefit from Austudy because of the effect of the sibling concession. It recommended that Austudy benefits not extend beyond a parental income of $55,000. This recommendation was affirmed in the recently released Austudy options paper prepared by Dr Bruce Chapman to which I think all of the speakers in this debate, at one time or another, have referred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In last year's Budget the Government announced a range of changes to better target Austudy to those in greatest need. Replacement of the former sibling concession with a flat dependent student deduction of $3,700 is, of course, a vital part of all those measures. The new arrangements better assist large, low income families to provide an additional income test free cushion for payment of maximum benefits. For a family with three Austudy students, maximum benefits are now payable up to a parental income of $28,100. In this way, revised arrangements better target Austudy to those people who are in greatest need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Harradine's motion seeks to reinstate the generous abatement rate provisions which would serve to benefit students from large, relatively high income families. However, he also seeks to retain the dependent child deduction. Senator Harradine is concerned that some families earning additional income will nevertheless suffer a net drop in disposable income through the combined effects of taxation rates and the loss of Austudy through the sibling concession changes. However, it must be borne in mind that these high income families are generally better able to plan towards periods of increased outlays without jeopardy to their children's education. The Government's first priority must be to the neediest sectors of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Harradine's proposal would be very costly and would jeopardise the integrity of the Budget. The Government's proposal announced in the Budget is expected to save $20m in a full year. Under the proposal advanced by Senator Harradine, the net effect would be additional outlays of $15m. The projected savings from the changes to the sibling concession have enabled the introduction of a range of beneficial measures, including some which are supported by Senator Harradine. For example, I understand that Senator Harradine favours the introduction of the student deduction. The measures will also enable the introduction of an increase to the student income test, deductions for students with dependants, the simplification of the Austudy academic rules and the extension of Austudy to students undertaking certain courses offered by private providers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of the increase to the minimum annual payment level for Austudy from $50 to $250, prior to 1992 Austudy was not payable if a student's annual entitlement was less than $50. In 1992 this was increased to $250 and this is being sought to be overturned. It is evident that the payment of a negligible amount of less than $1 a week is of little consequence to students making the decision whether to continue in post-compulsory education. The arrangement is inefficient and costly to administer, in that the costs to process the application will generally exceed the level of benefit to the student. While the new minimum level of Austudy is set at $250, it should be recognised that both the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training and the options paper prepared by Dr Chapman have recommended that the minimum level of assistance be set at $20 per week, or about $1,000 per year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My understanding is that Senator Harradine is concerned about the cumulative effect on disposable family income that this measure may have on families with two or more Austudy students. For a family with three students, who under the old provisions would have each been entitled to $100, the cumulative loss to the family income is $300. While I appreciate that a very small number of families will be disadvantaged in this way, it must be recognised that such families are likely to be relatively affluent with incomes very close to the cut-off point. Given this, and the sound grounds referred to above for increasing the minimum payment level, the Government believes it is important to pursue this course of action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that towards the end of his address to the Senate, Senator Harradine posed a question for the Government to answer. As I recall, the question was: could we provide the Senate with the number of people who are affected by these regulations? I have asked my advisers to see whether it is possible for that to be done so that I can conclude this debate by providing the information that has been sought by Senator Harradine. I am advised that at this stage I am not in a position to provide that information. But I can undertake to make that information available to all the parties in this debate when it comes to hand. I commend the regulations to the Senate and seek the support of the Senate to defeat the disallowance motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I indicate that, in view of the timetable and program, we will not seek to divide on this matter. However, there is a need to reply to some of the points made and I shall do so very briefly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, I turn to the question raised by the Minister, Senator Cook, and Senator Teague that my disallowance motion in relation to regulation 30, if successful, would reinstate both the sibling concession and the deduction for children. It is acknowledged that if regulation 30 is disallowed, regulation 89 of the principal regulations&mdash;the sibling concession&mdash;will be retained and that, through the operation of subparagraph 2 of regulation 28, which affects regulation 87, the previous prohibition on claiming both the sibling concession and the deduction for children will be removed.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understood that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This problem arises from the fact that the Senate is not able to disallow part of a regulation. In fact, I have a Bill which seeks to overcome that particular problem. However, if my motion for the disallowance of regulation 30 is successful, the Government could remedy the problem by the immediate gazettal of an appropriate regulation reinstating the prohibition on utilising both concessions. This was not my intention. I should have mentioned that point earlier&mdash;it was in fact in my speech notes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as regulation 30 is concerned&mdash;and I am not referring here to the technical question&mdash;I fear that the Government and the Opposition have not quite got the point. The Government says that the rationale behind the Austudy provisions is to remove financial barriers to post-secondary education and, therefore, the provisions need to be targeted at those most in need and not to the high income group. I understand that, but that does not address two questions. One is the fact that these regulations will substantially affect middle income groups. I gave certain examples and none of them has been tackled. I spoke about a family with two children on $32,000 a year, which these days puts it in the middle income group. Those are the sorts of people who will be affected by this provision. That is why I incorporated the graphs. Attention has not been given to that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other families in the $40,000 bracket could have quite a number of sons and daughters in education. Clearly, the Austudy provisions, which are to remove financial barriers to post-secondary education, may not be thought to be terribly relevant. A letter from a constituent whose family is in that bracket says quite clearly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . .  I now have a tertiary student along with a further tertiary student living away from home by necessity but the total allowance has now been decreased by $64 per week as compared to 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A further child was going to undertake his Master's Degree during 1992 which was required to be undertaken in Launceston as the Hobart campus of the University could not offer it to him. He has now declined to do so because of the meagre allowance that he would have received. If he does not obtain employment (he possesses a Bachelor of Commerce Degree in Accounting) he will subsist on Unemployment Benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What annoys me so much is&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and he goes on. It is really a cry from the heart. I appeal to the Government to give this matter consideration. It is a question of horizontal tax equity. Whole groups of families are battling it out on their own, and many of them will get nothing. They cannot even claim a taxation deduction for the expenses incurred for the education of their children. That is unfair. They are taxed as though they have no children; they are taxed as though the children do not depend on the family income, and that is dreadfully unfair. Perhaps that is an argument that should be pursued at another time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the point that regulation 30 will have grossly inequitable effects on some middle income families. I am not standing here for high income families; I am referring to a whole lot of middle income families, particularly those in the bush. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That leads me finally to the points that were made on regulation 23, and I appreciate the comments made by Senator Sowada. The clear point&mdash;and the Government has to look at this at some stage&mdash;is that the regulation as drawn says `if a student would be entitled to it'. It does not say `if students in a family' or `the total payment to a family is'. I think that is relevant. I repeat my concern that it is $250 as a result of the regulations I am trying to disallow. What about next year? Will it be $1,000, as recommended by Chapman? In those circumstances there will be a situation where a family with three students, each eligible to receive Austudy at the rate of $900 per annum, would lose $2,700. That is a considerable amount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point to remember, and it has not been focused upon by either the Government or the Opposition, is that once that level is raised from $50 to $250, as the Government has now done, the student eligible to receive between $50 and $250 a year is no longer eligible to receive any Austudy and is therefore ineligible to receive any fare allowance. I see Senator Crane coming in. He would agree that that is a very grave situation for people in the bush. If the Opposition wants to vote against the motion, it can vote against it. As far as I am concerned, the Opposition should vote for it. I commend my disallowance motion to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I made a few remarks after the former Chairman of the Select Committee on Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals in Australia, now the Deputy President, had finished speaking. I had made a couple of introductory remarks before we went on to the debate on Austudy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee of which Senator Colston was Chairman and I was Deputy Chairman was formed on a resolution of the Senate in November 1988. I believe the Committee was very thorough and exhaustive in its deliberations and we tabled our report in July 1990. Despite the Senate convention that the Government table responses within three months, we have waited nearly two years for this report. In the intervening period, I believe that time has been wasted, although the Government has moved forward in a couple of areas, as I will indicate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it somewhat insulting for the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) to suggest that the Government has moved swiftly, as he does in the first part of the Government response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has moved swiftly to overcome these areas of concern.</PARA>
<PARA>To give him credit, he goes on in the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Overall the Committee's Report provides a blueprint for the management of farm chemicals in agricultural production for the next decade.</PARA>
<PARA>He also makes a point later that some of the Committee's recommendations may be progressed at a pace that is commensurate with the economic restraint we need to exercise in these times. There are three different issues. I believe that, by taking so long to table the reply, we have wasted some time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A close reading of the Government response&mdash;and we received it only a couple of hours ago&mdash;indicates that, although many of the Committee's recommendations have been taken on board, after two years there is still much work to be done. For example, the Committee made specific recommendations concerning the membership of the Australian Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Council and the consultative arrangements for that council. The Government's response merely notes that a range of options for advisory mechanisms are still to be considered. I do not consider that that gives sufficient attention to such an important aspect of the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue, and one the Chairman has already taken up, is the Government response to our concerns about aerial spraying. I consider that much of the angst about aerial spraying would disappear if the Committee's recommendations on this matter were implemented fully: that is, there should be a uniform national approach to the regulation of aerial spraying. Unfortunately, the Government response indicates very little progress towards achieving this objective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One matter that I am particularly pleased the Government recognises is education and training. During the inquiry I took particular interest in this aspect. Evidence to the Committee recognised that it is the key to the responsible and judicious use of agricultural and veterinary chemicals. I note that the Government response indicates a government commitment to this area and, in particular, improvements to occupational health and safety. I quote from the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is pleased to announce that the development of national standards for the training and licensing of pest control operators, recommended by the Senate Select Committee, is currently being undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a step in the right direction. As a former Deputy Chairman of that Committee, I am very pleased that that has proceeded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also welcome the recognition by the Government that rural women have a significant role to play in the safe and responsible use of agricultural and veterinary chemicals. I made the point numerous times during the inquiry that if the housewife asks her husband, or whoever it happens to be, what chemicals he is using, when he has used them, whether he wants his clothes washed with the other clothes around the house or whether they should be washed differently, she would have a better understanding of what is happening and the male out in the field doing the spraying would be more responsible. In some places in Western Australia we saw women driving the spray rigs because they were so well set up. They made sure by using charcoal filters and the like that no contaminants got into the cabins. In some places women were out in the field. I am not saying that women are always the ones who stay home to do the washing. I note that an occupational health and safety grant has been made for the development of educational and training materials on occupational health and safety issues for rural women. I think that is great. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the establishment of the national registration scheme, in accordance with the recommendations of the Select Committee. When the Committee was investigating this matter the possibility of a national scheme was considered unlikely. Nevertheless, the Committee felt that a national approach would be sensible, practical and cost-effective, not only for government but also for industry. I am pleased that in less than two years the Commonwealth, the States and the Territories have agreed to establish a national registration scheme that will streamline the clearance process of agricultural chemicals in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee made several other recommendations. I do not have the time to go through them all. A couple of areas are of interest. The Committee recommended that the brochure entitled `Chemical Residues in Food&mdash;Questions and Answers' be circulated widely in the community. I notice that that has been widely circulated by the chemical residue section of the Bureau of Rural Resources. That is a step in the right direction. If people understand what they are using, be it a chemical or anything else, or that when driving a motor car they understand that it can be a dangerous weapon if it is used in the wrong way, that is a step in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area was the priority for labelling of home garden products. As you, Madam Acting Deputy President, would know, a lot of the time people around the garden do not know what is being used to spray roses or whatever. Those articles should be labelled properly. The revised guidelines for the labelling of home garden and domestic products are soon to be published. That is a step in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically&mdash;this is a message I would like to get through to this chamber for the second time today&mdash;farmers are very responsible people; they do not want to overuse chemicals. They want to use them only to do the essential job to make sure that they get the cleanest and best food onto the table for people to eat. For example, the Committee looked at a couple of breakthroughs. One of them was the weed activated spray system which was invented by Warwick Felton from Tamworth in my home area. It has sensors that detect individual green weeds. The sensors individually spray only those green weeds in a fallow paddock. The savings in chemicals are absolutely magnificent. There is a saving of about 90 per cent in many instances in the amount of chemicals that are used because all the bare ground is not sprayed while spraying the green weeds. That is a breakthrough. It is a saving to the farmer in the monetary sense. It does not use any more chemicals than are needed to be used to do the job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another breakthrough is in the bio-control area. Recently I received a paper from the Minister for Agriculture in New South Wales, Ian Armstrong, relating to the bio-control of Bathurst burr. Bathurst burr is a very annoying weed, especially in New South Wales and in other parts of the east coast, though not so much in Western Australia. Departmental officers have identified and patented a naturally occurring fungus that kills Bathurst burr. That will bring about a saving in the use of chemicals and is a much more responsible way to kill weeds rather than having to use heaps of chemicals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The weed activated spray that I was just talking about, invented by Warwick Felton, is of immense help in the land degradation area where people are using chemical farming much more readily now that it has been perfected in a way that is beneficial both to the user and the end product. It is also beneficial to the land. If one is not ploughing the land regularly and the land is kept untilled, it is of great benefit to the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the Government's recognition that farm chemicals play a vital role in Australia's agricultural industry, which they do. Used properly, they are a great tool for anyone in the farming community. I believe that the Committee's report recognised this fact and highlighted Australia's hard-earned reputation for clean chemical free food. We have clean chemical free food in Australia. It is of immense importance that we keep our food clean and pure. Yesterday I met with people from Europe and learnt a little about the problem they have with contamination in their river systems and the problems that they have in getting pure food. In the future we will be in a great position to sell pure food to the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the Government's statement that the Committee's report represents a blueprint for the management of farm chemicals in agricultural production for the next decade. In conclusion, I am relieved that the response has finally been tabled. The Select Committee worked very hard to reach timely, responsible and balanced decisions and it is incumbent on the Government to make sure that the work of the Committee is now fully implemented. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like my colleague Senator Brownhill, I have had the report of the Senate Select Committee on Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals in Australia for only a short period and have not studied it fully. I take this opportunity to congratulate the Committee on the work it did in this area. It certainly brought back some balance into the debate that was ensuing in the Australian community at the time the Committee started its inquiry. When we look at things such as the use of chemicals it is essential that all aspects and considerations be taken into account. Its presentation should be put in a balanced and proper way, and the Committee did that. As I said, the inquiry brought back some balance into the debate which was at that time getting one-sided. In many instances, there were calls for random banning of the use of some chemicals. The people who were making those calls were doing so purely and simply on emotive grounds and not on grounds based on fact.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like Senator Brownhill, I am pleased that the Government has responded to the Committee's report. It took a significant amount of time, and it might say that it needed that time. However, I think it would have been beneficial to the industry and to the people involved in the use of those chemicals&mdash;whether they be manufacturers, aerial sprayers or users&mdash;had there been a quicker response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is not a lot that I can find fault with in the Government response. I urge the Government to address the issue of aerial spraying in particular. It is an important and integral part of the application of some chemicals. In many instances, aerial spraying is the only method by which the chemicals can be applied because of the terrain over which they are being used or the weather conditions that prevail. The use of a wheeled vehicle or sprayer at such times could create enormous erosion problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point that needs to be pursued and about which more information needs to be put on the table relates to the beneficial impact in terms of land conservation and the use of chemicals as against traditional methods of agriculture. It has been demonstrated in many instances that the development of minimum tillage&mdash;I note that that is included in the report and the response&mdash;is one of the best ways of overcoming the severe erosion problems caused by wet conditions or wind erosion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the Government response to the report is responsible, but much work still needs to be done on this issue. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you may be aware, the Government recently introduced the Corporations Legislation (Evidence) Amendment Bill 1992 into the Parliament. This Bill (copy attached), which was passed by the House of Representatives on 30 March 1992, substantially implements the recommendations in the Committee's Report. In particular, the Bill removes the derivative use immunity from s.68(3) of the ASC Law and from s.597(12) of the Corporations Law and removes the immunity in respect of the fact that a person has produced a document from s.68(3) of the ASC Law. In addition, the Bill provides that corporations are not entitled to claim against self incrimination.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I note, however, that the Bill does not adopt a further recommendation of the Committee that there be a five year sunset clause on the amendments. The reason for not allowing that recommendation is that serious problems could arise in the prosecution of matters which may have been under investigation for some time. Investigators in complex cases would be hampered by the uncertainty of not knowing which rule of evidence would apply at the time of trial and prosecutions not completed when the immunities revive would be jeopardised by the inadmissibility of crucial evidence. This would involve considerable expense in wasted resources over a long period of time, but could also be expected to bring into disrepute the Government's public commitment to effective law enforcement in the corporations area.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committees' Report makes a number of comments about the present state of Defence readiness and preparedness. These comments rely heavily on the Committee's judgement that credible contingencies could arise with `little or no warning'. While the Government accepts that such contingencies could arise with little warning, our force structure should take account of our strategic circumstances&mdash;including the limited capacity of countries in our neighbourhood to conduct operations against Australia and the lack of any reason for them to do so. Readiness consumes resources so the readiness posture adopted must reflect prudent risk management. The Committee's misunderstanding of this key policy concept, which determines the force structure and preparedness of the ADF, leads the Committee to make recommendations which are based on a false premise. The Government already maintains significant Regular and Reserve forces capable of responding to a low level contingency at short notice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Intelligence provides early warning and is central to the ADF's level of operational readiness. Within a responsible resource framework, the Government supports continuing substantial investment in intelligence and surveillance capabilities, with particular emphasis on the development of systems to integrate, analyse and disseminate intelligence and surveillance information from military and civilian sources. The Minister for Defence touched on this subject in his Ministerial Statement on the Reorganisation of Defence Intelligence in March 1989.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The findings of the Force Structure Review were tabled on 30 May 1991 and are now being implemented. A further review at this stage would be untimely and inappropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Naval Reserves</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee considered the Naval Reserve was generally effective in the performance of its roles and tasks. The Committee was concerned, however, about an apparent lack of progress towards a contribution of the Naval Reserves to the mine countermeasures role. The Government's detailed comment on the Committee's concern is provided in the response to Recommendation 1.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Army Reserves</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee claimed the military capability of the Army Reserve was grossly inefficient and suggested a lack of resources has generated an Army Reserve which provides:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a.generally ineffective vital asset protection brigades because of equipment and manpower deficiencies and unsatisfactory training objectives and standards,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">b.ineffective manoeuvre and follow on brigades because of poor strength and equipment levels, and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">c.ineffective logistics support because of shortfalls in equipment, low manning levels and training deficiencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The contrast between the strategic guidance for ground force readiness in relation to that of air and maritime elements has been the source of considerable debate both within Defence and the public arena. Without re-addressing the arguments, the fact remains that Army Reserves readiness must be viewed in the context of the current ground force readiness. Specific comments are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a.The observation that the Regional Force Surveillance Units are only marginally effective must be questioned, given the Report's own observation that they exhibit `an ability to be operationally ready within their degree of notice'. What is accepted is that the Areas of Operations allocated to the Regional Force Surveillance Units are vast.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">b.Criticism of the performance of Logistic and Vital Asset Protection Units on K89 does not recognise the dual influences of budgetary and time restraints. The number of Reservists on K89 would have been higher had the resources been available to support them, and if the community was prepared to accept their absence from their place of work for protracted periods. It is expensive to move units and individuals in and out of isolated exercise areas for limited periods. There are also continuity requirements which make it difficult for Reserve units to be employed for short periods within extended exercises.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">c.The lack of training by Vital Asset Protection Brigades in their designed areas is also largely based on resource constraints. It should be noted that all Vital Asset Protection Brigades conduct Officer and Non Commissioned Officer training within their Areas of Operations. All Vital Asset Protection Brigades have also conducted exercises within their Areas of Operations for all elements at least to sub-unit level.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">d.Army's observation on the limited capacity of the Reservist to absorb complex capabilities or react to short term contingencies is not, as the Report states, an attempt to suggest the existence of any innate factors within the Reserve. Rather, it is a recognition of the limitations imposed, given the time available for the Reserve to train. Capabilities which require ongoing skill reinforcement, either because they are complex or need to be maintained at high levels, are not generally appropriate for the Reserve. Army does however have Reservists who perform complex tasks, such as surgeons and technicians, who maintain these skills in their civilian occupation. Reserve units are on high degrees of readiness, such as the Regional Force Surveillance Units, where preparation for their likely operational tasks can be achieved in the training time available.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">e.Training difficulties mentioned within the Report may be able to be addressed through training being task-related. This is already done to a large degree within the Reserve for individual training. Consideration will be given to applying it at the collective level where training objectives can be focused onto unit tasks rather than roles. There is a fair degree of risk involved in such an approach but in the case of Vital Asset Protection Units it may prove acceptable. Such an approach may allow resources to be applied more economically, enhance training validation, and enable units to meet high performance levels.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">f.Manning and equipment deficiencies receive continual attention within Army. Currently Army Office and Land Command are reviewing the methodology of recording Minimum and Operational Levels of Capability (MLOC and OLOC). Clear, quantified requirements for MLOC and OLOC will provide a calculated measure against which effectiveness and readiness can be established. This will ensure rational allocation of equipment and manpower, in accordance with existing strategic guidance and budgetary constraint.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Report costs its proposed structural changes for Army at around $700 million, in addition to the Ready Reserve costs and ongoing additional annual operating costs rising from $2 million in the short term to $50 million after 10 years. There is little doubt that the deficiencies that do exist could be overcome by such an increase in expenditure. However, without the provision of additional funds, Army could only implement the recommended changes to the detriment of other capabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A detailed response to the Committee's concerns is provided in the responses to Recommendations 2 to 6 and 9 to 12.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ready Reserve</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In framing its comments on the Ready Reserve, the Report asserts that no persuasive argument had been mounted to support its need. The Report's criticism of the Ready Reserve appears at odds with its desire to see greater readiness and service flexibility on the part of Reservists. In Army the Ready Reserve is part of the Active Army Reserve, the only distinction between it and the General Reserve is the degree of training commitment and the conditions of service that reflect this commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee concluded, however, that the Ready Reserve Program may well operate as planned but the 12 month initial training period was excessive, and could have an adverse effect on the General Reserves. The Committee was also concerned that the Ready Reserves might have been introduced at the expense of two Regular battalions and the General Reserve.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Detailed comments on the committee's concern are provided in the responses to various recommendations on the subject but specific comments are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a.The conversion of 6 Brigade from a Regular to Reserve formation is seen as consistent with strategic guidance. It is quite apparent that the conversion increases the immediacy of the Reserve in reacting to any land threat. The readiness level of 6 Brigade is adequate to allow it to complement the Operational Deployment Force in a low level threat situation if called out.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">b.The impact of 49 Royal Queensland Regiment moving to Ready Reserve conditions of service is localised due to the regional nature of the Army Reserve and the discrete funding of the Ready Reserve. There are to be no equipment or manpower reductions in General Reserve units to raise Ready Reserve units and Army Office is to determine the benefits of increasing Regular manning within General Reserve units.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">c.There are no apparent ARes strength management and recruiting problems arising from the introduction of the Ready Reserve. Again the regional nature of the Reserve and the specific recruiting targets for the Ready Reserve has reduced any competition for recruits. Likewise, the demand for General Reservists to transfer to the Ready Reserve is not sufficient to generate problems of any consequence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">General Reserve</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Report's criticisms of the Army Reserve are fundamentally based on the Reserve's inability to achieve degrees of readiness that the Committee believes are required by strategic guidance. This criticism is based on a perception of the nature of credible contingencies and time scales necessary for these contingencies to arise which is in fact at odds with strategic guidance (see comments on readiness and preparedness).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Report does not acknowledge the benefits provided by Reserves on long degrees of notice over `soldiers off the street' and so does not recognise the advantages inherent in a standing Reserve. The Report also fails to address the fundamental nature of Reserve service, that is, that it is made up of part time volunteers who balance their Reserve commitment with a primary career and other personal commitments. The Committee's Report does not address the impact of high degrees of readiness and greater training commitment on Reservists' ability to serve.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Air Force Reserves</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee believed the Air Force Reserve was meeting its allocated roles and tasks. However, in the Committee's view, the RAAF needed to make much better use of Reserves in aircrew and airfield defence guard positions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's comment is provided in the response to Recommendations 7 and 8.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Responses to Recommendations</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A list of the recommendations in the Committee's Report is attached, with a Government response to each.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RECOMMENDATION 1</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that Navy should develop an auxiliary minesweeping capability within each of eight Reserve Port Divisions to complement the four coastal minehunters that are to be acquired.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed in Principle</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In highlighting this shortcoming, the Committee was critical of the Force Structure Review's recommendation not to procure the planned permanent core force of ten auxiliary minesweepers. At Paragraph 6.57 of the Report, the Committee strongly recommended the development of a Reserve based auxiliary minesweeping capability within the eight Port Divisions at an estimated cost of $20 million over the TYDP. Prior to the Force Structure Review, the intention had been to adopt a similar approach to that recommended by the Committee; however, there are now a number of difficulties with this recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Force Structure Review recommended the core force of ten auxiliary minesweepers should not be procured, based upon the re-orientation of the limited resources within Navy to improve the balance of the Mine Warfare force. Despite this decision, the Force Structure Review indicated that the Craft of Opportunity (COOP) concept would be proven and would provide a basis for timely expansion, drawing on civil resources; ie Reserves.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, Navy intends to retain the three vessels of the Interim Minesweeping Force, currently comprised of the Auxiliary Minesweepers BROLGA, KORAAGA and SALVATORE, to complete development trials, prove the COOP concept, and provide continuation training in the minesweeping skills and commence peacetime route surveillance operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Additionally, in line with the current initiatives to restructure and fully integrate the Australian Naval Reserve into the Permanent Naval Force, it is intended to continue a program of Reserve involvement in mine countermeasure operations, although it is not envisaged that auxiliary minesweepers will be entirely manned by Reserves. Indeed, the past focus of the Reserves, that is the Port Divisions, has been replaced with an integrated local and national Naval infrastructure where Reserves now work directly as part time members of the Permanent Naval organisation producing a sense of unity and identity with the whole Navy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is planned to use Ready Reserve personnel to supplement the crews of coastal and inshore minehunters noting that these personnel should possess a higher level of training, skill and experience than personnel from the General Reserve. The General Reserve personnel will be trained to supplement COOP crews in the minesweeping and route surveillance roles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RECOMMENDATION 2</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that Army's capability to perform the reactive role be raised significantly by restructuring 6 Brigade.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not Agreed</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government does not consider that strategic guidance requires that 6 Brigade be restructured as suggested by the Committee. To restructure 6 Brigade with the varying degrees of notice suggested by the Committee would:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a.require sub-units and possibly units to be composed entirely of ARA to meet the shortest notice, defeating a major benefit of having an integrated formation;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">b.likely require the movement of ARA from other parts of the Army to 6 Brigade to meet the increased support required by the higher readiness elements; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">c.the aim of creating a Ready Reserve brigade would not be met by what would in essence simply become ARA and ARes units sharing a common location.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RECOMMENDATION 3</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that if the planned, continual review of the Ready Reserve indicates that 6 Brigade is unable to perform the Land Warfare role at 28 to 90 days notice, it should become a Regular brigade.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not Agreed</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Based on present strategic guidance, the Government does not accept the requirement for 6 Brigade to be able to respond at 28 days notice. The development of the Ready Reserve within Army will be subject to intense scrutiny to determine both budgetary and operational performance. It is anticipated that a recommendation on the viability of the Ready Reserve will be possible at the end of 1994. The Ready Reserve is a new and innovative concept in the ADF which needs to be thoroughly tested.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RECOMMENDATION 4</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that Army's Manoeuvre Forces and Follow On Forces be restructured so as to contribute much more appropriately to the preparedness of the force-in-being for the self-reliant defence of Australia as endorsed by Defence policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not Agreed</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The changes to Army's structure recommended by the Committee appear to require a degree of preparedness that is not required by the nature of likely credible contingencies, nor by the time scales necessary for a major ground threat to develop. The Committee's concerns regarding the relatively long degree of notice applying to some elements of the Army Reserve is noted. Army has undertaken to review the application of longer degrees of notice to see if reductions are required within strategic guidance and are sustainable within budgetary guidance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RECOMMENDATION 5</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that, also through restructuring, the Logistic Support Force should be brought from its current manning of about 2,800 to its authorised level of some 3,300.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not Agreed</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Within its current manning, the Logistic Support Force is structured to provide graduated support to forces deployed on a range of credible contingencies. It is adequately manned to support the more likely contingencies, and can be appropriately augmented in sufficient time to respond to other credible contingencies that may arise. Augmentation could involve reinforcement by ARA and ARes personnel, and drawing upon other elements of the Army structure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RECOMMENDATION 6</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that, in the light of the Department of Defence's declared policy on independent brigade operations, the retention of Headquarters 2 Division be reviewed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not Agreed</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The importance of retaining Headquarters 2 Division was confirmed by the Force Structure Review. Headquarters 2nd Division provides Army with a doctrinal base on which to develop and maintain command and control skills for higher level conflict. It is an important element within the Follow on Force providing an ability to command Brigades and other elements being prepared for operations. In the event of a conflict developing to a higher level, Headquarters 2nd Division will be capable of deployment with skilled staff and current and validated procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RECOMMENDATION 7</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that, should the review of the Ready Reserve Program confirm this view, [at paragraph 7.18] these ADG squadrons be manned by part-time Reservists serving, say, 40 days per year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Ready Reserve Program is to be reviewed in three years time. The review will consider any changes which might be appropriate. However, the initial view is that the readiness state required for RAAF ADGs could only be achieved with full-time training. Part-time training of about 40 days, would allow for the maintenance of the required capability and readiness achieved through previous full-time training.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RECOMMENDATION 8</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends the introduction of an integrated structure in at least five or six selected operational squadrons employing a strong cadre of `career Reservists' (up to 200 training days/year) to support a large component of `part-time Reservists' (say, 40 days/year), with key squadron posts available for the career development of PAF members.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not Agreed</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To crew five or six flying units presupposes that 130 to 156 former RAAF pilots with at least one tour on the squadron aircraft type would be available and willing to serve in the Reserves for up to 200 days per year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recommendation is based on the US Air National Guard concept which would not be appropriate to the significantly different scale of operations in Australia for two important reasons:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a.the unavailability of sufficient former PAF-trained aircrew to support a scheme of this magnitude, and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">b.the unlikely prospect of attracting sufficient numbers of Reserve personnel opting for 200 days Reserve service a year at substantially reduced conditions of service compared to continuing full-time service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thus, the claimed financial saving could prove illusory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be noted, however, that before promulgation of the Force Structure Review, a Reserve aircrew scheme known as the Aircrew Contingency Scheme (ACRS) had been approved for introduction by RAAF in 1991. This program, currently being implemented, is designed to increase the number of aircrew available for contingencies and consists of three elements:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a.Reserve Operations (RESOPS), to provide for the transfer of a number of aircrew positions from the Permanent Air Force (PAF) to the Reserve;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">b.Reserve manpower (RESMAN), to formalise the current temporary assistance provided by Reserve aircrew to the PAF; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">c.Staff Operations (STAFFOPS), to shadow post Reservists against selected staff positions to release PAF aircrew for flying duties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RAAF has continued to review the ACRS and has recently decided to transfer the RESOPS Program from the Active Reserve to the Ready Reserve. This will result in the inclusion of up to 64 Reserve aircrew in the Ready Reserve.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ACRS, including this most recent initiative, should not be confused with the Aircrew Contingency Supplementation Scheme (ACSS) which provides annual motivational flying for retired, previously qualified F/A-18 and F-111C aircrew, and which forms part of the RAAF General Reserve (as distinct from the RAAF Ready, Active and Special Reserves). Thus, the Committee's suggestion that the ACSS (not the ACRS) be transferred from the Ready Reserve to the RAAF General Reserve is a non sequitur as the Scheme is already a part of the RAAF's General Reserve.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RECOMMENDATION 9</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Notwithstanding the complex administrative and legislative tasks involved, the Committee recommends:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.generally the Reserve types of service be streamlined and standardised;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.specifically that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">&mdash;each Service should have two parts only&mdash;Regular and Reserve;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">&mdash;the Reserve part should have two components&mdash;Active and Inactive; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">&mdash;reference to emergency forces and emergency Reserves should be deleted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed in Principle</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Assistant Chief of the Defence Force-Reserves (ACRES) is presently coordinating a review of the various components of the Reserves in the ADF with the aim of updating and rationalising the various forms of the Reserves. Amendments to legislation and regulations will be recommended accordingly. The objective of the ACRES review is to achieve as much commonality as is practicable across the ADF.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RECOMMENDATION 10</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that, in conjunction with the rationalisation of the multiple types of service within the Active Reserve component, a range of inducements be introduced to ensure that `part-time Reservists' serve the minimum number of days commensurate with the role and readiness requirements of particular force elements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed in Principle</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Services are presently examining whether the Ready Reserve conditions of service are applicable to other elements of the Active Reserve. In general, elements which may have a case for similar conditions of service are those which have a readiness and training commitment similar to that of the Ready Reserve. Application of these benefits would be subject to budgetary provisions. An annual retention bonus already applies to members of the Army Individual Emergency Reserve. Navy is already implementing this recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RECOMMENDATION 11</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On balance, and notwithstanding the considerable pressures on the TYDP, the Committee recommends that the ARes should be equipped fully at an estimated $700 million ($100 million for each of seven brigades) for the vital asset protection role as soon as is practicable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not Agreed</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government acknowledges that deficiencies, where they do exist, could be largely overcome by a large increase in expenditure in appropriate areas. This would involve either an increase in the budgetary allocation to Defence or an adjustment in existing priorities within Defence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In considering the first option, a realistic and responsible approach is needed and expectations should match the resources Government can provide. Since the White Paper `The Defence of Australia 1987' the real growth in Defence outlays has averaged 0%. In the current strategic and economic circumstances, the option of increasing expenditure is not feasible when overall priorities related to resource allocation are considered.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second option would have to compete with other projects announced in the Force Structure Review. Alternatively, the $700 million could be funded from planned expenditure over the TYDP by reducing further the number of Permanent Personnel. At an average per capita salary and allowance cost of $36,000, there would need to be a reduction of approximately 1,950 Permanent Service personnel or 3% of the ADF's current strength.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Neither of these options are acceptable to Government. The Force Structure Review determined the way ahead for the ADF. The Review took account of the strategic priorities and the likely resource environment. Within this framework, decisions have been made on the relative priorities for different investment proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some $50 million has been programmed to provide equipment for the Ready Reserve Brigade, and additional resources will be devoted to improving Army's mobility, including the motorisation of the Ready Reserve Brigade and two General Reserve Brigades. While additional investment may be desirable, it has to take place among other ADF priorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RECOMMENDATION 12</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the on-going Ready Reserve review process should focus on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.matching the length and content of periods of initial training with the applicable role(s) and capability requirements;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the question of whether the requirement for a second brigade group in the Ready Deployment Force (but held routinely at longer notice than 3 Brigade) can be met by Ready Reserves;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the transfer, where the required levels of readiness can be achieved effectively, of Ready Reserve structures and capabilities to the General reserve (eg RAAF Air Defence Guards); and</PARA>

But no, not a word of that; there was just an insertion on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> and the tabling of the report in the chamber. It is a gross discourtesy, not only to the members of the Committee but also to the witnesses and all the people who worked on that report, that they are treated in such a cavalier way when the Government's response is made as it is now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What of the response?  I will go through that in more detail in a few moments. The response is unimaginative and uninformed; at times it is illogical; it contradicts itself. Overall, it is a quite unprofessional document. It is a document which seeks to preserve the status quo. In a sense, we are seeing in the response of the Department of Defence to the Committee's report a literary example of a modern Singapore garrison mentality: the defence of the status quo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee's report does not pretend to be infallible. It does not set out to be an immutable blueprint for what the Government ought to do in this field. But it is a closely reasoned and logical approach to what is a very difficult subject; namely, the state of the Australian Defence Force reserves. The report did come up with some innovative, creative and, above all, constructive proposals as to how this problem could be tackled. But nothing the report said has been picked up by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report was led by the evidence that was given to the Committee. No-one started out on that Committee with any theoretical model as to what the Australian Defence Force reserves should be. We were led by the evidence given to that Committee. We were an all-party committee. We came down with a unanimous report. Frankly, the report deserves better treatment than it has received in the hands of the faceless bureaucrats who made the response for the Government. I am quite sure that Senator Ray never read the report that we tabled, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Australian Defence Force Reserves</EMPHASIS>. I am quite sure he has never read the response that is being made in his name in this chamber today. I think that says it all about the Government's interest in the vital and basic duty that it has to defend Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The response to the report is composed mainly of assertions, a few misinterpretations of what the report actually says and some misconstructions. I think the most disappointing thing about the Government response is that there is no solid reasoning or even explanation behind the assertions it makes rejecting the recommendations of the defence Committee. All we get are the old cliches&mdash;strategic guidance, force structure, warning time and all the rest of it; all the old cliches that those of us who have been around the defence debate have heard ad nauseam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose I should not be surprised, let alone disappointed, at the response from the Government. The Defence Subcommittee has produced a series of very well researched and very well presented reports over the last six to eight years and on no occasion has the Government or the Department of Defence done anything other than treat those reports with stony silence or, at best, damn them with faint praise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am glad that the Government has made as bad a response as it has on this particular occasion because, unlike the earlier reports we did&mdash;the one on the resignation rates when service personnel were leaving the Australian Defence Force, voting with their feet against the Government's lack of policy in defence; the management report and the other reports that have preceded this one&mdash;what we are involved with in respect of the report on the reserves is a body of about 30,000 Australians who serve in the Australian defence forces. They have a very keen interest in the way the Government is treating them at present. While the Government does not want the matter to be debated in public, those people in the reserves&mdash;and it is far more than 30,000 when one takes cognisance of those Australian men and women who have served in the reserves over recent decades&mdash;will see that this debate is carried on. You can prophesy with absolute confidence that the Government will come out of this very badly because the response today is very inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a nutshell, the Committee showed up the shortcomings of the Australian reserve forces, and it made some suggestions about what could be done to satisfy the Government's own policy directives. The thing that has really infuriated the Department of Defence is the fact that the Committee took the parameters set by the Government and the Department of Defence&mdash;the policy directives set in Defence of Australia 1987 and subsequently in Australian Strategic Plans for the 1990s&mdash;as policy directives and showed how the Government had not met its own objectives. We would not have minded if we had been able to see that it was making plans to achieve its goals, but on so many occasions we saw that it simply had not made the logical steps which follow from the goals that it laid down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was common knowledge all around this town in the early part of this year&mdash;I heard in January or early February&mdash;that the Department was very upset with our report and that the method of attack would be to say that we had proposed readiness times for reserve units that were quite unreal. That, of course, has come to pass. That is the central argument that the Government is using against our report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is rather ironic because we recently had a report by Mr Alan Wrigley into aspects of the Australian Defence Force. The bureaucracy, the interdepartmental committee that had a look at that on behalf of the Government, damned that report on the grounds that lead times for readiness proposed by Mr Wrigley were too long to be workable. Today we have a response from the Government to the defence Committee's report which damns it because it says lead times are too short. It is a very interesting proposition&mdash;one which, of course, simply has no substance at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The defence Committee did not have any choice in the way it wrote the report. It had to write the report to five terms of reference. Those terms of reference were proposed by the Minister. Essentially, we had to write to published strategic guidance in the form of the Defence of Australia of 1987, updated by ASP `90 which I mentioned before, and certain things followed from that. The Committee wrote meticulously to the terms of reference, even though everyone except the Government knows that those terms of reference are outdated and totally discredited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The DOA paper of 1987 and ASP `90 both were written, despite what some senior people in the civilian side of Defence have said in my hearing within the last couple of months, before the collapse of the Soviet empire. We are now faced with a totally different strategic world. To argue the way some of the civilians do in defence that, because the geography of Australia never changes and one cannot move Australia to another part of the world, the principles outlined in DOA 1987 therefore have eternal life, is to exercise one's mind in a very childish argument. Of course things change as the politics of the region change, and the politics of the region in which Australia is situated now are quite different from what they were when the strategic guidance papers were written in 1987. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to briefly look at the Government response itself. At a future date I will go through this in much more detail. Probably much to the dismay of my colleagues, I will do it on the adjournment one night. But my response to the Government's response to the report does deserve a more reasoned approach than I am able to give at the moment, having had only a short while with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, the first point the Government makes occurs in its first paragraph in the `General Comment on Readiness and Preparedness' where it attacks the Committee in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These comments rely heavily on the Committee's judgement that credible contingencies could arise with `little or no warning'. While the Government accepts that such contingencies could arise with little warning, our force structure should take account of our strategic circumstances including the limited capacity of countries in our neighbourhood to conduct operations against Australia and the lack of any reason for them to do so. Readiness consumes resources so the readiness posture adopted must reflect prudent risk management. The Committee's misunderstanding of this key policy concept, which determines the force structure and preparedness of the ADF, leads the Committee to make recommendations which are based on a false premise.</PARA>
<PARA>With the greatest of respect to the Government, I believe that it is the Government which is making the false premise. If one is familiar with defence papers, one will know that the phrase `little or no warning time'&mdash;in association with the so-called low level contingencies, which is the central point of Australia's defence strategy at present&mdash;occurs over and over again. It occurs with good reason. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one can believe in the low level contingencies which the Government talks about in terms of credible contingencies&mdash;I do not happen to find them credible, but that is another point that I will develop at another time&mdash;it necessarily follows that the lead time and the warning time could be only a matter of hours. It may not be; it may be quite a long period. Obviously, defence planning has to cope with that. That is why one sees in all the defence papers that phrase `little or no warning'. It is quite fallacious and specious to say that the Committee was fixed on this idea of little or no warning time and, therefore, all the recommendations that it made subsequently fall down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee understands very well that readiness costs money. If forces are going to be held at high degrees of training, ready to go on active service, there is a disproportionate cost in doing so, and there is no point in doing so unless there is a clearly definable reason. There is a world of difference in having a system in place which allows reserve forces the luxury of 180 days or 360 days to get ready. If we are paying $500m a year, as we are for the Army reserves&mdash;part of which are on 360 days readiness&mdash;we are not getting any benefit. One might as well recruit people off the street, if there is a year to prepare, and not carry the cost of them in the reserves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next thing that the Government does to justify its ridicule of little or no warning time is to puff itself up with the brilliance of its intelligence services. The next paragraph of its response states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Intelligence provides early warning and is central to the ADF's level of operational readiness. Within a responsible resource framework, the Government supports continuing substantial investment in intelligence and surveillance capabilities. . .</PARA>
<PARA>I have no quarrel with that. My quarrel is with the assumption that intelligence services are accurate predictors of what is going to happen. We only have to look at the last decade. The intelligence services did not know that Iraq was going to invade Kuwait in August 1990. They did not know that the Iraq-Iran war was going to start. They did not know that the attack on the Falklands by the Argentinians was going to take place. Close to home, the Australian intelligence services did not know that the Fijian coup was on. They did not know that the first one was on; they did not even know about the second one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By all means we ought to do our best to gather the best intelligence that we can, but we always must be alive to the possibility that it is not infallible and that we are going to be caught out. That is the argument for having some realistic preparedness times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's response states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government already maintains significant Regular and Reserve forces capable of responding to a low level contingency at short notice.</PARA>
<PARA>I ask the Government: where are those forces? Apart from 3 Brigade in Townsville, which is a two-battalion brigade&mdash;the Operational Deployment Force&mdash;there simply are no forces ready to go on short notice. The Air Force certainly cannot commit, other than in the maritime reconnaissance role and in the transport role, any squadrons on operational service in the strike and in the fighter role&mdash;the air superiority role. The lack of any effective ECM capability, the lack of any AWACS capability, prevents them operating effectively. Of course, we all saw in the Gulf deployment with Desert Shield and Desert Storm the huge flurry in getting only two ships ready to go onto a patrolling station in the Persian Gulf. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the ridiculous situation today that when the RAN wants to send some of its ships on operational service, it has to transfer the fitment of the close-in weapons system from one DDG to another just as years ago, in some families, people had to take it in turns as to who went out because they had only one set of clothes. The Government cannot maintain that it has significant regular and reserve forces capable of responding to a low level contingency at short notice. It is misleading; it is not telling the truth in making that claim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rest of the response to the report deals with a number of claims that are not backed up in any way at all by reasoned argument. The Department does not seem to understand the Committee's criticism of the Ready Reserve scheme which was introduced. The Committee made the point that it thought, in the short term, the Ready Reserve scheme would operate very well, but it saw significant problems with it in the longer term. To go on, as the Government does, to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The conversion of 6 Brigade from a Regular to Reserve formation is seen as consistent with strategic guidance&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>is to make a claim that does not appear in strategic guidance at all. It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is quite apparent that the conversion increases the immediacy of the Reserve in reacting to any land threat. The readiness level of 6 Brigade is adequate to allow it to complement the Operational Deployment Force in a low level threat situation if called out.</PARA>
<PARA>The Government is fooling around with words there. How can the removal of two professional regular battalions&mdash;which is what happened when 6 Brigade was disbanded and reformed as a Ready Reserve brigade&mdash;and the replacement of them by a Ready Reserve battalion, admittedly quite well trained initially, compensate for the loss of two full time battalions? Even if one can accept that these guys are as good as the regulars that they have replaced, which is demonstrably false, the readiness period required is still 90 days. There is no faster response from the ready reserves than from the regulars. It is a very misleading and a very specious argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a claim here that the report does not acknowledge the benefits provided by reserves on long degrees of notice&mdash;I was talking before about people on 360 days over the `soldiers of the street'&mdash;and does not recognise the advantage inherent in a standing reserve. I make the point that, when it is costing us $500m a year for the reserve scheme, we ought to be looking at getting the maximum benefit from it and not have people on 360 days notice before we can use them in an operational setting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the part of the response which deals with the recommendations, pretty well every recommendation, except for a couple of motherhood ones, is rejected by the Government. In that we see illogical inconsistencies in the Government position. It is arguing one thing in one place and arguing against the same proposition in another place. Its response to recommendation 2 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government does not consider that strategic guidance requires that 6 Brigade be restructured as suggested by the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA>It is saying, on one hand, that the Ready Reserve is ready but, on the other hand, it is not ready. It is these sorts of things that expose the Government to ridicule. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is certainly a misrepresentation of what the Committee says in the Government's response to recommendation 3. We do not say that we require 6 Brigade to operate with 28 days notice. We say between 28 and 90 days, according to the circumstance. There is a world of difference, as honourable senators would be aware, between one month and three months. I will come back to the response at a future date and go through it in detail, not that it demands any intellectual effort at all, but for the sake of the record it ought to be corrected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have here is really the defence of the status quo, as I said before. We have a very difficult task in managing the reserves and getting value from them. It is a very complex issue. The propositions that were advanced in the Committee report deserve some consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a very good article on Desert Storm recently in the US <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Armor</EMPHASIS> magazine.

Before the suspension of the sitting, I was quoting from a postscript by Richard Cheney, the United States Secretary of Defense. It continues:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They were activated last December and went into battle with their Abrams tanks when ground operations began in Kuwait on the 24th of February. Before dawn, moving north inside Kuwait, Company B discovered a large formation of Iraqi tanks. They saw some of the top-line T-72 tanks heading straight toward them through a large group of dug-in Iraqi armor. All told, the Marine company with 13 tanks faced 35 oncoming Iraqi tanks, outnumbered nearly three to one. But when the encounter was over, the Marine reservists had destroyed or stopped 34 of the 35 enemy tanks. In fact, in a total of four engagements in four days, Company B stopped 59 Iraqi tanks, 30 of them top-line T-72s. What makes it all the more impressive is that Company B had never used those Abrams tanks before they arrived in the desert. That was their first exposure to the new equipment. And they trained on it, acquired the capability to operate it, and then performed superbly in combat.</PARA>
<PARA>Company B was a Reserve company. It was called up on 12 December. On 26 December, in the United States, it converted from M-60 tanks to Abrams&mdash;a huge jump in technology. It graduated on 13 January with the Abrams. It was in Saudi Arabia on 17 January. It inherited new Abrams tanks which virtually had no equipment in them. It had to kit the tanks out. In action, it breached the defences in the southern part of Kuwait. One of the most difficult of all land operations is the armoured penetration of a minefield. It completed four battles there with the successes that Mr Cheney indicated, and it returned to America on 25 April. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was a Reserve battalion. It re-equipped with a totally new type of technology in the Abrams tank and it did that in a matter of weeks. It went into action and fought brilliantly. Yet we have these uninformed minds who wrote the report for the Minister saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Capabilities which require ongoing skill reinforcement, either because they are complex or need to be maintained at high levels, are not generally appropriate for the Reserves.</PARA>
<PARA>That is utter nonsense. When the report was tabled by the Defence committee I forecast that it would be met with silence and buried by the Department. I made the point today that the reserves of Australia will not allow that to happen. The sad thing is that they are the victims of all this. They will go on sinking further and further because they do not have the resources to support them. The only thing wrong with the Australian reserves is that they are so badly under-resourced; they are very badly off. We made the point that they had to be provided with equipment and training opportunities to reach the level that the Government wants from them, yet we get the fatuous statement in this report that to do so would mean that the Defence Force could not do other things. In other words, the Government is so blind that it cannot see the need for money to meet the minimal objectives that it has set for itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reserves will go on, under-resourced, with high wastage rates and poor morale. More regular COs will come in for units which will also destroy the morale of the officer corps. We are in a vicious cycle. The Government had an opportunity to take notice of ways in which that situation could be corrected. Instead, the report was given to somebody who received his military knowledge from a comic book. Some uneducated, junior clerk wrote this report. It is one of the most insulting documents ever to be put in the Parliament and it is something that will haunt the Government because the reserves of the Australian Defence Force will see that this debate is maintained in public.

Honourable senators will recall that the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances was concerned at aspects of the Freedom of Information (Miscellaneous Provisions) Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1991 No. 321. Our difficulty was with provisions concerning conclusive exemption certificates which exclude public disclosure of certain material in documents. The regulations provided that such certificates were to remain in force for five years. This was in contrast to the report by the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on the operation and administration of the freedom of information legislation, which recommended that certificates should only be effective for two years.</PARA></TALK.START>

I reported to the Senate in some detail on this on 24 March 1992 and incorporated our correspondence in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. Subsequently, on the same day, the Senate disallowed the regulations on policy grounds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At its next meeting the Committee discussed the effect of the disallowance, which was that while the regulations had set five years duration for conclusive certificates, following their disallowance such certificates were in force indefinitely. The Committee then decided to write to the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy), noting his earlier advice that the Government accepted that this indefinite operation was inappropriate, and asked whether it was intended to make fresh regulations to set a duration shorter than five years. The Attorney-General replied promptly, confirming that the Government believed that there should be a limit on the duration of certificates. Although he still considered that two years was too short, he said that the Department would consult with other agencies to ascertain the best way to resolve the matter. The Committee considers that this helpful advice from the Attorney-General should be made known to the Senate.

For instance, one set of guidelines, which had to be observed when making decisions under the Act, was to identify children in economic need, and to calculate maximum amounts payable to the operators of child-care centres. Another set of guidelines was to limit and guide a broad discretion granted to the Minister to determine whether a child-care centre was eligible for fee relief.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The particular guidelines in question were made on 19 December 1990, tabled in the Senate on 12 February 1991 and considered by the Committee at its regular meeting on 7 March 1991. The guidelines were not accompanied by the usual explanatory statement. Also, on their face, they provided the Minister or, of course, a delegate, with the discretion to approve a child-care centre as eligible for Commonwealth grants even though at the time the guidelines were not met. Such a discretion always attracts a question from the Committee if, as in this case, there was no obvious right of review of the discretion either in the parent Act or other delegated legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee wrote to the Minister about these aspects of the guidelines on 11 March 1991. The Minister replied on 29 May 1991, providing an explanatory statement. That document assisted the Committee, as it confirmed that there was no external review of an adverse exercise of the discretion. The only protection available for people affected by the guidelines was that they may apply again at any time. Thus, any defects in the original application may be corrected and a refusal is not regarded as final. However, while this is a safeguard of sorts, it may not be an appropriate substitute for external, independent merit review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Therefore, on 7 June 1991, the Committee wrote back to the Minister asking whether advice had been sought from the Administrative Review Council or the Attorney-General's Department on whether AAT review was appropriate in this case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 24 July 1991 the Minister replied to the Committee that merit review of discretions in the guidelines was not considered appropriate because the parent Act did not provide for AAT review of what could be termed the head power in the Act. The Committee accepted this point, as we understand that it is the view of the ARC that it may not be appropriate to have subsidiary discretions subject to review when the head power is not so subject. However, this at once raised the question of whether review of that head power should be reviewable by the AAT. This letter from the Minister had also advised that although the guidelines were drafted by the Office of Legislative Drafting, which the Committee has found to produce good quality work, advice was not sought from either the ARC or the Attorney-General's Department on whether AAT review was suitable because of the absence of merit review in the parent Act. Therefore, the Committee wrote to the Minister for the third time on 16 August 1991 asking if he could approach the ARC for its advice on whether the entire general scheme, set out in the parent Act and implemented in detail through delegated legislation, should be subject to AAT review of the merits of any decision. The Minister helpfully agreed to do this.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ARC reported its findings on 13 December 1991, recommending that the parent Act, an associated Act and delegated legislation be amended to provide for review by both the AAT and, in one case, by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. The decisions which the ARC advised should be reviewable included every major discretion in the entire child-care program established by the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For instance, the Act provides that the Minister may determine that an institution is a child-care centre. The ARC advised that this discretion affected the interests of people concerned about receiving assistance. Also, although these decisions are made by a Minister, they do not fall into the class which, because of the level of consequence and highly political nature involved, should be exempt. In addition, these decisions do not involve matters of a polycentric nature, or competing interests of several parties, and are not merely facultative. Therefore, such decisions should be reviewable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There were numbers of other discretions which the ARC considered suitable for merit review by the AAT. Thus, one section provides that the Minister may approve a body to operate a child care centre. The ARC pointed out that although these decisions are not the final steps in a substantive process, they are essential steps. In addition, the same section provides two separate avenues for the Minister to determine that a child care centre is eligible for assistance under the Act. Both should be subject to AAT review, even though there is express provision in the Act for disallowable guidelines to be made to guide the exercise of the discretion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Act provides a number of discretions on recurrent expenditure. In accordance with its longstanding practice the ARC recommended that those which made allotments from a finite pool of money should not be subject to review, but that two discretions which did not involve such allotment should be reviewable. In this context, the power, in certain circumstances, to determine the rate of salary or wages payable at child care centres, should be reviewable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The power to make a grant for fee relief should be reviewable, even though this is another case where the Act expressly provides for disallowable mandatory guidelines in respect of the exercise of the power.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A discretion to seek repayment of overpayments, which the ARC considered was not substantially different from recovery powers in other Acts, should be subject to review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With respect to the disallowable guidelines actually made under the Act the ARC recommended that three discretions, relating to children in economic need and the amount of fee relief available, should be subject to review. One of these discretions should be reviewable by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, which is thus an example of a case where it is appropriate for an independent tribunal other than the AAT to examine the merits of an individual decision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the ARC sent its recommendations to the Minister on 13 December 1991 the Department did not notify the Committee of this until 16 April 1992, or more than four months later, and only at the prompting of the Committee secretariat. A delay of this length may indicate management problems in the Department.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the other hand, the Committee has received particularly constructive advice from the Minister, Peter Staples, Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services, that necessary changes to the Act would be progressed in the Autumn sittings next year. While the Committee appreciates that this may be the earliest sittings in which the legislative program can accommodate the amendments, the Committee will indicate to the Minister that the importance and sensitivity of child care would justify its introduction early in those sittings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is grateful to the Minister for this cooperation, which will improve the technical quality of legislation in the portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In summary, the Committee's scrutiny of this instrument illustrates the thoroughness and persistence of its operations. More than a year elapsed between the meeting at which the Committee first considered this matter and the final undertaking by the Minister to amend the Act. Moreover, it will be two years from the time the Committee raised the matter with the Minister in early 1991 until the Act is actually amended. Nevertheless, these comprehensive changes to the Child Care Act, and its associated delegated legislation, arising entirely from an initiative by the Committee, will result in the introduction of important safeguards for those affected by Commonwealth child care programs. This is an example of the diligence with which the Committee pursues its mandate from the Senate.<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unless the Parliament provides otherwise, section 66 of the Constitution prescribes a maximum annual sum for the payment of salaries to Ministers. Amendments to the Ministers of State Act which sets this sum are thus required from time to time to cover changes to ministerial salaries. The sum appropriated is to meet the expected cost of salaries and no more. While the Act covers the total cost of salaries it does not set the amount of individual salaries to Ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The enactment of the Remuneration and Allowances Act 1990, has had, amongst other things, the effect of linking the basic salary levels for parliamentarians to the top of the Senior Executive Service band one in the Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is also a similarly proportioned increase in the salaries of Ministers of State. Following the enactment of the Remuneration and Allowances Act the Government set in train arrangements to ensure that the relativities established between the salaries of parliamentarians at that time are maintained. That is, Ministers' salaries are increased at the same rate and at the same time that salaries of senators and members of the Parliament increase. Ministers receive the same percentage increase in additional salaries as members of the Parliament and are phased in the same way.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill relates to the  provision of untied financial assistance to Local Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Its objective is to put in place arrangements for the provision of identified local road funding to Local Government for the three years 1992-93 to 1994-95.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In respect of local roads funds, the Special Premiers' Conference of October 1990, decided that funds for local roads would be untied and paid to Local Government, or to State Governments where they are  responsible for local roads, via general purpose grants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government decided to introduce interim arrangements for 1991-92 to provide a period of stability while the detailed arrangements were finalised for subsequent years. The interim arrangements were reflected in the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Amendment Act 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the interim arrangements were agreed to in 1991, there have been extensive consultations with Local Government and with the States. These consultations were marked by a positive attitude and a genuine desire on the part of all parties to develop arrangements acceptable to all concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government would like to take this opportunity to place on record its appreciation of the co-operation afforded by the Australian Local Government Association and the various State Associations which comprise its membership. Their contribution is evidence of the value of Commonwealth and State Governments fully involving them in the development of Commonwealth and State policies that will affect directly or indirectly Local Government and its operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The arrangements that are now incorporated in this Bill reflect the advice and suggestions that were obtained through the consultation process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the arrangements proposed in the Bill</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;the funding involved will continue to be separately identified rather than absorbed into general purpose assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;each State's share of the funding level of some $300m will be maintained at the present proportion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;the arrangements will operate for a three-year period 1992-93 to 1994-95.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;the funds will be distributed in each State on the basis of principles reflecting road needs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;the legislation will no longer provide specific allocations for special roads works but the funding of such works may be provided for in the principles that will govern the distribution of grants in each State.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As for 1991-92 the funding will be untied which will mean simply that the manner in which it is spent will be entirely at the discretion of the local governing body.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The commitment, previously given by the Government, to maintain this funding in real terms will be honoured.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The distribution of funds between local governing bodies in each State, as noted above, will be in accordance with principles reflecting road needs. These principles will be worked out between the Commonwealth and each State and Local Government Associations in that State.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth will be insisting that principles that are developed are consistent with the Commonwealth Government's response to the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An important feature of the new arrangements is to provide funding for councils in the Northern Territory so that all local governing bodies in that Territory which are receiving general purpose assistance from local government will also receive identified road funding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This change will extend identified local road funding to an  additional 52 local governing bodies in the Northern Territory, the great majority of which represent Aboriginal communities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This change will be achieved by providing for a mechanism to transfer some local roads funds, currently paid to the Territory Government, to Northern Territory Local Governments via the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1986.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The level of the funds to be transferred will be decided following consultations between the Minister responsible for Local Government in the Territory and the Commonwealth Minister for Local Government. Up to some $12m could be involved in the transfer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This change will not disadvantage mainstream councils in the Northern Territory, but will bring arrangements in the Territory into line with those in the rest of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will also be some adjustment to funding levels in Tasmania, dependent on negotiations between the Tasmanian Government and the Municipal Association of Tasmania. These negotiations concern the responsibilities of the respective spheres of government concerning certain road works. Funding levels will reflect adjustments to responsibilities. Some $4.5m could be involved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In both the Northern Territory and Tasmania the adjustments decided will be notified in the Commonwealth Government Gazette according to the requirements of this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The net financial impact of the changes proposed in the Bill is nil. Increases in funding to the Northern Territory and Tasmanian Local Government will be offset by an equivalent reduction in general purpose assistance provided to those State governments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of the timing of the Government's decision it is not expected that the State Local Government Grants Commissions will be recommending any significant changes to the distribution of grants in their respective States for 1992-93. Certainly the Commonwealth will not be insisting on any such changes. This situation should now assist councils in their planning for the coming year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the changes that are proposed will provide a firm basis for the provision of these grants for the next three years. They will improve the equity of the arrangements. Consistent with our policies for Local Government they will, in addition, strengthen the role of that sphere of government that is so important to all Australians.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to discuss the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Australian Vocational Certificate Training System by the Employment and Skills Formation Council on behalf of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training</EMPHASIS>. The report proposes a new entry level training system designed to meet Australia's training needs into the next century by improving the coverage, quality and equity of vocational certificate training in Australia. The report stresses that it is not a short term response to the recession and high youth unemployment but proposes a long term strategy marked by three time goals: 1995, 1998 and 2001.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Carmichael report adopts, with some modification, the targets outlined in the Finn review, otherwise known as the Young People's Participation in Compulsory Education and Training report. The Australian vocational certificate training system aims to meet by the year 2001 the training participation and attainment targets of 90 per cent of 19-year-olds completing year 12, 90 per cent of 20-year-olds attaining level 2 vocational certificates or higher, and 60 per cent of 22-year-olds attaining level 3 certificates or higher qualifications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The system would merge apprenticeships and traineeships as part of flexible training pathways. TAFE would be the main provider of advanced vocational training in a network of nationwide senior colleges, skill centres, and private and community providers of on the job and off the job training. These pathways would allow for recognition of prior learning and credit transfer. We have heard much discussion about competencies and the definition of key competencies. The focus of competency-based training is on proficiency in the generic competencies, skills and outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Carmichael report does not shy away from the problems of access and equity, specifically for women, non-English-speaking background migrants, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, people with disabilities, the rural poor and marginal workers. The year 2001 is the target date for the equal participation of ethnic groups, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and for women and men in the vocational training system. The report recognises:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">affirmative action is needed not only to entice young women into non-traditional vocational training and to change attitudes in these occupations but to extend equal training, accreditation and recognition arrangements to the service occupations in which women are concentrated.</PARA>
<PARA>The report does not overlook the fact that women's participation and success in industry is affected by the concentration of women in traditional areas of study and occupation, a lack of female peers and role models, child-care, retraining opportunities and support services. The report also recognises that a realistic means of financial assistance is essential if young people, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, are to enter further education and training. It offers insight into the inadequacy of Austudy and questions the worth of a loans scheme&mdash;a debate that was raging yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report acknowledges that Austudy may act as a disincentive for young people to participate in education and training and expresses concern about the potential impact of a loans scheme on deprived income families and on trade and other training. This is particularly revealing in the light of the Chapman report's recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One aspect of the Carmichael report which has industrial implications is that of trainee wages and training allowances. According to the report, wages in their current form do not bear any relation to the competence or performance of the individual. While concluding that trainee wages are the responsibility of industrial relations parties, it recommends that a trainee wage should be based on time spent on the job, the level of competency attained and the value of the competency demonstrated by the worker on the job. The issue of youth wages is an important one, and it is equally important that wages for young people are not undercut as a result of altered trainee wages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report recommends a $1.2 billion real increase in Commonwealth expenditure on vocational certificate training by 1998. This covers funding for TAFE and skill centres, the provision of employer subsidies, the professional development of teachers and trainers, the provision of trainee allowances, and for additional modern plant and equipment. As Carmichael has stated publicly, unless there is a guarantee that the funds earmarked for the expansion of vocational training will not be siphoned off for other projects, the vocational training system will fail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The implementation of competency-based training has the potential to strengthen the role of industry, to boost our international competitiveness, the skills in our workplace and our strength as a nation. There is much to be commended in the Carmichael report. It is a very weighty and lengthy document which is worthy of far more than the five minutes we are able to give it today in the Senate. I commend this report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak tonight on the findings of the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Australian Vocational Certificate Training System</EMPHASIS>, the Carmichael report, which was put out by the Employment and Skills Formation Council. It is a very important document and has many implications for the future of vocational training in Australia. The report is to be commended for addressing a very important issue facing the area of training. As stated in the report, the global economy has become fiercely competitive, and a better trained work force is indispensable to competition. Therefore, our education and training must be markedly improved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report follows on from another very important study, the Finn report on young people's participation in post-compulsory education. It even recommends and produces a broad plan for the implementation of some of the key recommendations of the Finn report. Part of this is the recommendation that all students participating in post-compulsory education should undertake on the job training. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report outlines the development of a common vocational education and training framework which uses competency standards, curricula, assessment and certification of skill acquisition to align upper secondary schooling, TAFE, private training provisions and work-based training. Students could be offered subjects with a strong vocational content which have credit into post-school training courses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a revolutionary concept and represents a marked departure from the philosophy that currently underpins secondary schooling in Australia. The concept of a general education will be replaced by one which includes a more vocational emphasis through the learning of generic skills. The recommendations of the report dovetail neatly with the Finn report concept of key competencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report proposes the replacement of apprenticeships and traineeships with a competency-based system encompassing upper secondary schooling, TAFE, private providers and enterprise training on and off the job. The report proposes a new system of entry level training which would effectively merge the current system of apprenticeships and traineeships into a new Australian vocational certificate training system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the most sensible suggestion is that apprentices who master the skills of their trade more quickly than their peers should not be held back by rigid requirements of progression. If they master skills more quickly at one particular level, then they can move on to the next level. One key recommendation of the report is for the establishment of a vocational year of training whereby students who have completed year 12 may undertake a course delivered by TAFE or senior colleges which would include structured work placement, preparing students to attain a standard level recognised and comparable across the broad spectrum of vocational training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is proud of the fact that the year 12 retention rate has risen but it will not acknowledge that this is the result of the great recession that young Australians have suffered under this ALP Government. Many young people go through to year 12 as they have no alternative other than to join the one million people who are unemployed. The recommendations in this report will make retention at school until year 12 a more worthwhile pursuit for those who do not wish to pursue tertiary education. In the past, many of these went on to apprenticeships and many simply entered the work force as unskilled labour or in growing numbers joined the dole queue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After year 10 the education system has not served the non-tertiary stream well. The retention rate for year 12 has increased as a result. However, the subjects offered to those students often have very little to do with vocational training. Presently there is not sufficient integration between the school system in years 11 and 12 in preparation for entry into the work force. The recommendations of this report will help achieve that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Carmichael report offers a radical alternative to a stale, outdated system. It addresses many important issues that need to be looked at very carefully by all people interested in the Australian education system. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to discuss the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Higher Education Council&mdash;Sixth Report to the National Board of Employment, Education and Training</EMPHASIS> on the operation of section 14 of the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 and the higher education contribution scheme. The report views the profiles process and briefly addresses institutional autonomy and reviews the operation and effects of the higher education contribution scheme. The report concludes, on the basis of evidence, including an Ernst and Young survey:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">HECS has not had an impact on the size of the higher education system.</PARA>
<PARA>This is supported by the high levels of unmet demand we have been unfortunate enough to witness this year. However, it goes on to state that the higher education contribution scheme is not a severe financial disincentive to enter higher education for year 12 students and rates HECS as a middle ranking factor in the decision not to undertake university studies. One might ask what constitutes a severe financial disincentive? The report also states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">HECS has little effect on the decision of the educationally disadvantaged groups identified in the research.</PARA>
<PARA>It is unfortunate that this is not accompanied by any information on particular groups in the community to provide a realistic breakdown about the HECS effects on participation rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An analysis of the statistics of students who elect to pay HECS up front reveals a steady increase in the number of students 19 years and under choosing to make up-front payments. This number has risen from 12.8 per cent to 17.5 per cent in less than three years. This indicates that there is a large number of students whose HECS is paid for them, presumably by their parents. Evidence supports this, showing that private school students are more likely to pay up front, with their parents footing the bill. This report sadly lacks a socio-economic breakdown of up-front payments. This would enable us to establish the socio-economic backgrounds of the students and might provide alarming evidence for the Government about the nature of students entering tertiary institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look forward to the upcoming report which determines the appropriateness of using postcodes as a socio-economic indicator, thus providing a means of monitoring the participation of students from lower socio-economic backgrounds in tertiary education. A report released last month by the South Australian Office of Tertiary Education in fact reveals that the State's eastern suburbs are disproportionately represented in universities. These statistics confirm that students enrolled in universities are more likely to come from higher socio-economic backgrounds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's purported commitment to access and equity principles is meaningless when faced with this reality. This report recommends monitoring HECS every three years or at other times if there are major changes to the scheme. What further changes does the Higher Education Council or this Government have planned for HECS?  Is last year's above CPI Budget increase of $144 not a substantial enough change to this scheme&mdash;a scheme, I maintain, that is an unfair financial burden to those wishing to undertake education in this country?  The very people this Government attempts to encourage through the clever country rhetoric are in fact disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contrary to the report's recommendation, I stress the need for regular evaluation of the scheme, especially now that the first group of HECS graduates begin to repay their debts. The report alludes to the current public debate over threats to institutional autonomy. We assume this means the heated debate over the John Curtin School of Medical Research and other centres. The Senate Standing Committee into JCSMR agreed that the concept of institutional interference is a difficult one to assess. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree that there need be no conflict between academic freedom and institutional obligations, as in the profiles. Distribution of funds by the Government to institutions does entail certain obligations which include financial accountability and careful administration. The report is correct when it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The notion of autonomy is debased if it is invoked as a defence against well founded recommendations for change.</PARA>
<PARA>The report does cite potential threats to institutional autonomy, such as political pressures, employers and professional bodies in relation to pressure for funds and interference in curriculum formulation. This report is a more substantial one into the profile process and reveals a broad support for institutional profiles. Institutions, given the opportunity to stipulate agenda items, have focused on resource allocation, credit transfer, course articulation, links with TAFE and participation rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The work of the Higher Education Council provides us with important information through which we can monitor developments in the higher education system. I look forward to future reports and continued assessment of the effects of the higher education contribution scheme. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When we were last addressing the motion as moved by Senator Crane setting out very distinctly the reasons why Senator Cook should resign, we were dealing with matters that had come before us&mdash;particularly the letter from the former Commissioner, Ken Turbet, who has resigned from the Commission and who set out his reasons for so doing in a very succinct matter, and the letter in reply to Commissioner Turbet by the senator.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was pointing out the distinction regarding what the Government says it is in favour of, that is, the integrity of the Commission. The Government's position is that the Commission is the arbiter on matters of industrial relations and that its decisions should be respected. The Government says that the Commission is central to the functioning of the centralised wage fixing system which the Government says it supports. The points I was making with regard to the two letters as they had been exchanged were that former Commissioner Turbet&mdash;who is a man with a long Labor tradition and who believed in the principles of centralised wage fixing&mdash;had written his letter in very plain English. The strength of the letter is expressed in a paragraph that I previously quoted where he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, actions by you&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Senator Cook&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and your Government have damaged the public's perception of the independence and integrity of the AIRC. I acknowledge that this is difficult to prove and is denied by Government. However, as a person who lives and works in the industrial community I know it to be a fact. It does not happen overnight and it is not caused by one event or one statement. As a Government and as the responsible Minister you could at least be seen as standing by the Commission, showing support for the principles of conciliation and arbitration.</PARA>
<PARA>There are many points in this exchange of letters which highlight the fact that indeed the Government has, by its own actions, undermined the standing and integrity of the AIRC, unlike the Opposition's position. We are opposed to centralised wage fixing systems and want to see a freeing up of the labour market. We are not being hypocritical. We state our case and we state it plainly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that my colleague Senator Crane was making that Senator Cook ought to resign as a Minister was borne out not only by this exchange of letters but also by his behaviour in this Parliament. He has simply given an untruthful account of what happened in the Robe River matter and again he gave untruthful information to the Senate concerning APPM. Perhaps the worst offence is that he really did defame Senator Panizza and, at every opportunity he has been given, he has failed to apologise to him. I find that discourtesy from a Minister to a senator in this chamber quite unconscionable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During Question Time, when the Minister rose to speak in answer to a dorothy dix question, we tried to get him to admit on television that he was in fact a member of the BWIU and had been an official of it. It took him two hours to admit verbally in the Senate that he is in fact a member of the BWIU. That was only after Senator Crane had gone and obtained the documentation which showed that Senator Cook had shown in writing that he was a member of the BWIU and had disclosed it, as he is required to do as a Minister, and that it was a position which could cause a conflict of interest situation. The Minister went on to defend the BWIU. He is clearly in a position where he has a conflict of interest on this matter, but it took him two hours to admit it in this Parliament. In supporting my colleague Senator Crane's motion, there is ample evidence and the motion should be passed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That there is a fundamental difference between this Labor Government and the Australian Industrial Relations Commission is now beyond doubt. That is why I also, along with Senator Bishop, support the motion moved a couple of weeks ago by my colleague from Western Australia, Senator Crane, which calls on the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) to resign because of the circumstances surrounding the resignation of Commissioner Turbet from the Industrial Relations Commission, in particular, the statements in the form of a letter which Commissioner Turbet made in advising the Government of his resignation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the one hand, we have this Government reining in the independence of the Industrial Relations Commission while, on the other, we have the senior officers of the Commission, such as Commissioner Turbet, jumping ship. The resignation of Commissioner Ken Turbet from the Industrial Relations Commission on 14 April and the reasons behind it are further evidence&mdash;if any evidence was needed&mdash;of the subservience of the Minister for Industrial Relations to the Australian Council of Trade Unions. Commissioner Turbet is the third longest serving member of the Commission. He has been a dedicated supporter of the trade union movement for 30 years and a member of the Industrial Relations Commission for 14 years. The circumstances leading up to his resignation have been brewing for some time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite claims to the contrary, the Government has been moving to emasculate the Industrial Relations Commission. For example, when the Commission rejected the national wage case decision in April last year, the ACTU and the Government&mdash;many would say that they are one and the same&mdash;circumvented the Industrial Relations Commission and made their own deal which the Industrial Relations Commission was eventually forced to ratify. It is this sort of shady deal between the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and his mate Bill Kelty which has prompted Commissioner Turbet's resignation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, the Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook, has been completely left out in the cold as far as this deal making is concerned. While he mouths platitudes about the impartiality and independence of the Industrial Relations Commission, he is absolutely unable to prevent it being undermined by the accord. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Commissioner Turbet's letter of resignation to the Minister is a damning indictment indeed of this Government's conduct of industrial relations. The letter reveals the depths of the Commissioner's disillusionment with and loss of respect for a government which he has long supported, and I emphasise that he has been a long-time supporter of the Labor Party and of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commissioner cites three reasons for his resignation. Firstly, he says that the Government cannot be relied upon to keep its word. In support of this he cites the fact that, despite the Government's declared acceptance of the independence of the Remuneration Tribunal and acceptance that its determination should only be disallowed in exceptional circumstances, it rejected the Tribunal's decision on pay levels for Industrial Relations Commission members.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government has a history of interfering in the Remuneration Tribunal's decisions where the Industrial Relations Commission is concerned. It started in 1987, when the Government proposed to the Tribunal that commissioners get only 65 per cent of a deputy president's salary instead of the 70 per cent they were already getting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At other times, the Government has proposed breaking the salary nexus between a Federal Court judge and a deputy president of the Commission, overruling the Tribunal in the process. In May 1990, the Government created a furore when it revoked the Tribunal's recommendations on pay levels for the Industrial Relations Commission. It created the Gleeson Committee of review to review the administrative classifications and salaries within the Industrial Relations Commission. The Government stated that it concurred with the Gleeson Committee's recommendation that the Government should accept Tribunal recommendations. However, it was the Government's recent about-face when it rejected the Tribunal's latest recommendation for pay increases for Commission members that has so disenchanted Commissioner Turbet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reason for Commissioner Turbet's resignation is the damage the Government has caused to the public perception of the Industrial Relations Commission's independence and integrity. The appointment of individuals to the Commission has come under increasing criticism. Commissioner Turbet said that the Commission no longer represents a fair cross-section of the industrial community and is becoming top heavy which ACTU appointees. He accused the Minister of failing to support the Industrial Relations Commission and of being actively critical of it. Finally, the Commissioner accused this Government of a lack of respect for the constitutional obligations of the Commission and its high-handed disregard for the Industrial Relations Commission's authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That a man of Commissioner Turbet's standing makes such accusations, and takes such a dramatic stand and extraordinary step as resigning his commission, is a damning indictment of the Government and, in particular, of the Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook. It is quite unacceptable that the Minister should allow himself to be manipulated by the Keating-Kelty accord system. That he should stand by while the body which he claims is central to the industrial relations and wage fixing system in this country is pushed around at the whim of the ACTU is absolutely disgraceful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister said nothing when Kelty vilified the Commission. He did not demur when the Prime Minister, formerly the Treasurer, declared:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The accord is the primary national income determining institution.</PARA>
<PARA>The accord&mdash;the deal between this Government and the ACTU&mdash;not the determinations of the Industrial Relations Commission. Yet, at the same time, Minister Cook is making a lot of noise about the need to move to what he calls `enterprise bargaining' although his subverted definition of `enterprise bargaining' and `enterprise agreements' means that they are really nothing of the sort because they remain under the control of the ACTU. If any proof of this was needed, one need look no further than the Government's current proposal to bring independent contractors under the control of the union movement. The result of this piece of disgraceful manipulation will be to saddle the housing industry with all the corruption, rorts and exploitation which is so rife in the commercial building sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report of the Gyles Royal Commission into the building industry in New South Wales, released a couple of days ago, paints a graphic picture of what happens when powerful unions&mdash;and unscrupulous employers, in this case&mdash;are allowed to operate unchecked. Of course, anecdotal evidence indicates that New South Wales is not the only State in which this situation occurs in the commercial building sector. Undoubtedly, it occurs in my own State of South Australia as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government cannot have it both ways. Either it should have an Industrial Relations Commission that is allowed to do the job it is designed to do without ACTU and government interference, or it should scrap it altogether and move towards total deregulation of the labour market as the Liberal and National parties propose to do.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If true and genuine enterprise agreements were in place, the appalling situation that has been evidenced in the building industry in New South Wales and other States would simply not have developed and continued to exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The power of big unions like the Building Workers Industrial Union would be broken if compulsory unionism were abolished. There would be no need to deregister the Building Workers Industrial Union, as Commissioner Gyles recommended&mdash;or any other union for that matter&mdash;because they simply would not have the all-encompassing power which they are now given by the fact that they enjoy effective compulsory unionism.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ACTU is trying to do the impossible; it is trying to retain a centralised system while, at the same time, graft on us a sort of semi-deregulated system. Of course, as far as the ACTU is concerned, deregulation only applies where there are benefits to be gained over and above the award system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have now is the worst of all worlds; we have neither fish nor fowl&mdash;an industrial relations commission with no power and no credibility, and an industrial relations system that is supposed to be moving towards deregulation but which, in reality, is coming under tighter control by the Kelty-Keating axis and its shabby deals. The Government has destroyed any shred of credibility which the Industrial Relations Commission may have had. As it is at present, the Industrial Relations Commission is just a useful tool for ACTU manipulations. The Government's plan to restructure the Industrial Relations Commission and curb Commission salary rises will destroy what is left of its independence. It is no wonder that the morale of Commission members is so low that they are now deserting this sinking ship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Director-General of the Confederation of Australian Industry has expressed grave concerns about what is happening to the Industrial Relations Commission. As well he might. Despite the Minister's claims that the Government wants to free up the system of industrial relations, it is in fact moving to tighten up the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amalgamation of unions into mega-unions was a major step down that path and now the Government's aim of bringing independent contractors under the control of unions is just another. The failure of the Minister to protect the independence of the Industrial Relations Commission is a failure to respect the requirements of the Constitution. It is wrong for the Minister to claim that the Government recognises that the Commission has a central role `in ensuring equity and fairness in workplace agreements' when the Government is seeking to curtail that role. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Fair only in terms of maintaining the power of the unions. That is the whole purpose of this Government's policy. That the Minister's lack of ability to take any preventive action has resulted in the gradual demoralisation and disintegration of the Industrial Relations Commission is beyond doubt. In reality, the bottom line of this Government's policy with regard to industrial relations is far more sinister than that. Undoubtedly, the stench of death now envelops this Keating Labor Government. It knows that its days are numbered. That is evident every day in this Parliament as the day of the next election draws closer.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, it is now the aim of this Government to entrench union power as deeply as possible before it is thrown from office by the Australian people. Thereby, it will attempt to make life as tough as possible for the incoming Liberal and National Party Government to initiate the much needed reforms in industrial relations which all Australians are so desperately crying out for.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I assure the Senate and the Australian people that, no matter how difficult this present Government seeks to make things for the incoming Hewson Liberal-National Party Government by entrenching union power through the creation of mega-unions and the sort of legislation which it has foreshadowed is coming into this Parliament, a Hewson Liberal-National Party government will not be deterred from making the hard decisions and making the necessary changes to our industrial relations structure which, as I said, Australians are desperately crying out for. It is on that basis that the motion which my colleague has put to the Senate is of prime importance.

It is entitled to those views and I respect it for holding its views but I have to say that just about everyone else in industrial relations does not share them.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us identify one example: APPM, Burnie, Tasmania; date, now. What has happened?  This is a company which unilaterally removed the over award payments, which sacked workers because they would not allow the boilers that they were authorised to attend to be made safe. APPM has conducted a campaign of bypassing its representatives in the pretence that it wants to talk to workers, but only in the expectation of telling them and not listening to what those workers have to say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the one hand, we have the spectacle of this company being supported by Dr Hewson and John Howard and, on the other hand, being opposed by Premier Ray Groom, the Liberal Premier of Tasmania. Premier Groom supports the role of the ACTU in this dispute; he supports the people of Burnie; he has asked the company to come to the bargaining table and negotiate. Fortunately, it seems that in recent days the company has done that, after holding out and creating an extended dispute. We have a company subject to structural adjustment, because of changes in the broader economy and in protection, pulling on a full scale fight with its work force because it believes in an authoritarian command system of management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Down the road there is another company in the same line of business&mdash;the pulp industry&mdash;Australian Newsprint Mills, which is confronted by exactly the same market and commercial problems. It got all of its workers together and said, `Look, we will have some difficulties in the future. How can we join with you and you with us to work out our problems?'. ANM has established a cooperative team approach to resolving, on behalf of the company, the same sorts of problems which confront APPM. ANM is recognised by its commercial peers as an example of international best practice in managing companies, going through restructuring to make its product globally competitive in the market place. APPM is black, ANM is white. Here we have a black and white comparison between the worst practice, APPM, and the best practice, ANM. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Among the sillier remarks which I have heard about the APPM dispute was a remark by the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson. He said, `But the APPM dispute is a reflection of Senator Cook's rigid centralised industrial relations system'. I heard him say that. I have to say, so is SPC. SPC is an example held up by the Opposition as its version of what should be the case. SPC exists under the Government's industrial relations system. The difference is not the system; the difference is the attitudes of the managements of the two companies. The management of APPM wants to make war with and not love to its employees; the management of SPC and ANM want to make love to and not war with their employees and produce a better product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The system under which these two examples exist is the same system, with all the flexibilities available within it. The outcomes are not a feature of the system; the outcomes are a feature of the managements and their attitudes. I suggest that the Opposition would spend a great deal of valuable time in the interests of this nation, if it were to talk to those extreme right wing managements and suggest that they adopt the Government's policy of a cooperative approach to industrial relations, not a conflict approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This motion refers to the resignation of Commissioner Turbet from the Industrial Relations Commission&mdash;a resignation which was anticipated for some time&mdash;and the circumstances under which Mr Turbet has said that he is resigning. I understand the circumstances about Commissioner Turbet; I have answered questions in this place on previous occasions. I welcome to the floor of the Senate Senator Graham Richardson, who sat in this seat next to me for much of that time. He is an honourable senator, indeed, and a much maligned one by the Opposition in recent times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will come back to the issue. The issue is this: this Government supports the Australian Industrial Relations Commission as an independent arbiter to prevent and settle industrial disputes. The Government has this view of the Commission. From time to time, we may disagree with its decisions but, by God, we will fight to the death for its right to exist and make those decisions. That is the Government's position with respect to the Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me contrast it&mdash;and the blatant hypocrisy of this motion&mdash;with the view of the Opposition. The Opposition wants to abolish the Industrial Relations Commission. It should not come here as a wolf in sheep's clothing pretending that it is a defender of the faith, that it supports the Commission. The Opposition wants to abolish it. That has been said often enough by the Opposition spokesperson for industrial relations. Some members of the Opposition do not have the guts, like Dr Hewson, to say it frankly and openly. He said it when he was in Auckland talking to New Zealand businessmen, but, nonetheless, he was in tune with Australia and the Australian ear was listening to what he said. That is what Dr Hewson, the Leader of the Liberal Party and entitled to be believed, says he wants to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Back here, John Howard&mdash;a smarter politician, I think, and less ideologically rigid than Dr Hewson&mdash;says, `No, you have misunderstood. We do not want to do that; we want to provide a right of employees to choose'. That is what he says. Let us investigate for a minute what Mr Howard is saying because this will be instructive. He reckons he wants a right for employees to choose. He then says that employees will have a right to opt in or opt out of the Commission but that they will all be out to begin with. The only way they can opt in is if their employer agrees to let them. So the only way their grievances can be brought before the umpire for settlement is if the aggrieved party, the worker, has the consent of the employer to bring them there. He says that this supports the system and that this is free choice. Where there is a veto in access to the umpire by one party or the other, there is no free choice. These are just public relations words. When one looks at the content of those words one will see that they are vacuous and empty in the extreme. </PARA>

I do not think anyone on the Opposition side was here&mdash;Senator Reid may have been&mdash;when it occurred, but it was a recession under the Fraser Government with double digit inflation, double digit unemployment and negative economic growth. That was the recession of 1983, the Opposition's recession, with a wages blow-out as well. We came to government because of the good sense of the Australian electors in 1983. We came with an accord with the Australian trade union movement. We came with a wages policy. If one does not have a wages policy, one has not got an economic policy. </PARA>

It has no wages policy that befits a modern industrial state. We had one in 1983; we have one now. It is a visionary policy and it has worked for this country.

We never hear about the real problem of international access to markets. We never have that problem brought on as an urgency debate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us go to wages policy a la 1992. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in February put down the One Nation statement&mdash;an investment in public infrastructure development to stimulate economic growth in this country and to create employment. It is a statement which is working. I know that Senator Winston Crane says it is a disaster, because he wants bad news. He wants to luxuriate in unemployment. He wants to luxuriate in all these things because he wants bad news. He thinks bad economic news will mean his Party's election. One Nation provides economic stimulus in public investment and infrastructure to generate growth in this economy, underpin the structural change that we have overseen and lead us into a more competitive international position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of that, we have a wages policy. The first part of that wages policy is that the ACTU agreed to defer its application, due on 1 May this year, for a national wage increase. Why did it agree to defer it? It agreed to defer it in order to lock in the very low level of inflation that we have introduced into this economy and to lock it in as a permanent economic feature of the Australian economic landscape. It agreed to forgo its rights to make a wage application on 1 May in order to achieve that economic result. That is what one calls a wages policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ACTU did this in recognition of the fact that the One Nation statement will lead to job creation. It put jobs ahead of wage increases in terms of that negotiation. We, with them, will negotiate an appropriate time to approach the Commission for a general wage rise round for Australian workers some time later this year; we will agree on the timing and amount we go to the Commission with; and we will ask for a wage increase for everyone. We will be doing that while at the same time encouraging workplace bargaining generating productivity growth in this economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be wage increases to workers between now and the next national wage case, but they will be wage increases achieved out of productivity bargaining. The national wage case will ensure that workers who do not have access to those sorts of bargains can get a wage increase as well. This Government is concerned about getting an efficient wages policy, a best wages policy, but a policy that is fair to the underdog and people who do not have access to bargaining. So it has to be best and fair. This Government is about a best and fairest industrial relations system, and that is what we are presiding over. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am told, as I am in this motion, that somehow it is reprehensible that there should be this type of bargaining. It is not reprehensible that leaders of both sides&mdash;Bill Kelty, the Secretary of the ACTU, and Paul Keating, the Prime Minister of Australia&mdash;should actually talk to each other. It is not reprehensible that they, with their colleagues&mdash;Ministers in the case of the Prime Minister and executive members of unions in the case of the ACTU&mdash;should engage in bargaining. That is a monumental achievement for good economic management and governance of this country. It is not something that should be treated in a slovenly, shady and despicable way, as this motion does. It is something that should be admired and praised as a significant economic breakthrough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion also refers to me&mdash;that I am not part of these deals and I am therefore too weak. Well, can I give Opposition senators a news bulletin. That is rhetoric. What did Mandy Rice-Davies say when she was in the witness box in the Profumo affair? When allegations were made about her character by Dr Profumo, she said, `Well, he would say that, wouldn't he'. And she was probably right. Well, Senator Winston Crane would say that, would he not? He would say this because he wants to try to make a trite little superficial political point. Be my guest. If that entertains the honourable senator, if that makes him happy, if that makes him feel as if he is achieving something in his day, maybe his life, be my guest. It is fine if he is having a go at me. I am happy to accommodate him if that keeps him off the streets and out of trouble; if it makes him happy. But I am not going to be drawn into this type of silly, trite, stupid debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons that politicians in Australia are held in low esteem by the public is simply that they indulge in this sort of name calling&mdash;the sort of name calling that Senator Crane is indulging in. People out there who see the behaviour of members of parliament think, `God, what a hopeless lot!'. I do not want to be part of that. I would rather stand up for something nice in politics&mdash;about governing countries and taking responsibility for decisions and for economic outcomes. So I am not going to be drawn into the garbage that is contained in the last part of the motion. I am not going to swap anecdotes about people's characters and play the man and not the ball. I am not going to engage in all of this sort of carry-on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me go to the last part of the motion. I am called upon to resign because of all of the claims that are made. I would be happy to resign if it were a crime to support a free and independent Industrial Relations Commission. I would resign if I lived in a country in which that was a crime. I would be happy to resign if it was thought that having a sensible and responsible wages policy was an economic crime. I would not want to be a Minister in a government of a country that believed that. I would not want to be a Minister in a country where name calling and trite political point scoring, not good government and good management, was thought to be what politics are about. I would be happy to resign if I lived in a country where that was thought to be the ideal. Those sorts of things have been the order of the day in some countries. These countries have mainly been described as communist or fascist. I would not want to be a Minister in any of those governments; I would be happy to resign. But I am not going to resign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a modest role to play in this Government in terms of reform of the great landscape of industrial relations. I also have a role to play in respect of structural economic reform. My role is to help make Australia a world competitive nation. My role is to help change Australia from being an exporter of mineral commodities and agricultural products, from being a mine and a quarry and selling abroad raw materials at the cheapest and lowest price and buying back sophisticated manufactured replacement goods. I want to change Australia from doing that to being a manufacturing and service provider powerhouse in South East Asia and the Pacific rim. That is what I want to do. </PARA>

I would resign if our industrial relations policy of cooperation, treating people as human beings, respecting the value of their labour, enhancing their skills, encouraging their flexible deployment and their ability to absorb new technology had to change to an authoritarian, `Do as I say' policy&mdash;the `Come to work every day because you are afraid that if you don't you will be sacked' approach that we heard from Herb Larratt of APPM the other day.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President. This motion has resulted from the resignation of Commissioner Turbet. But there is a lot more behind it than just that resignation. Earlier in the debate I quoted what President Maddern of the AIRC had to say. A press report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the IRC's 1990-91 annual report, tabled in Parliament yesterday, Justice Maddern said it had been a difficult year, with commission members subject to abuse over the April National Wage Case decision.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on in his report to identify that abuse from employees and the Government. That is what this motion is about. We consistently have Minister Cook, in debate or answering questions, espousing the AIRC as the umpire. Yet when it suits him he goes out with his union mates, particularly the Secretary of the ACTU, Bill Kelty, and denigrates the AIRC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The classic example we have of this is the April 1991 national wage case, and I made a number of points about that. It was not only Senator Cook who abused the AIRC; it was also the then Treasurer, now the Prime Minister, Mr Keating. One of the answers is worth noting&mdash;I will not quote them all. When Mr Keating was asked whether he would not have preferred enterprise bargaining under the umbrella of the AIRC, his answer was no. We look at what Minister Willis had to say at the same time. He gave a similar answer to a similar question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is hypocritical of people on the Government side to get up here and espouse the virtues of the AIRC but, when it does not jump and bring down the decisions the Government or the Minister want, to go out and fight the AIRC in the public arena.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come now to some of the points that were made by Senator Sherry, and I want to relate them to what Senator Cook had to say. Senator Cook referred to my being a spokesman for the NFF and one or two other things, which is absolute nonsense. I want particularly to relate my comments to the New Zealand situation, which was raised consistently by Senator Sherry and by Minister Cook. Let us look at the figures put out just last week by the statistician in New Zealand. It is interesting to note that in the last quarter the number of people employed increased from 1,435,800 to 1,452,800. The participation rate went up to 63.7 per cent from 63.2. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has consistently talked in this chamber about how the workers in New Zealand have been screwed into the ground. Yet we find that real disposable income has increased by 1.2 per cent. If we look a little further, we find that productivity in New Zealand has gone up by between 50 and 90 per cent in a number of operations that have been publicised loud and clear in this country. Provisional work stoppage statistics in New Zealand for October 1991 showed no stoppages recorded. This is the first time that no stoppages had been recorded for a month since the Department of Statistics began publishing monthly work stoppage figures in June 1978. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Sherry will continue to rabbit on because he does not like to hear that the New Zealand situation is working. New Zealand has a current account surplus for the first time in many years. If we look a little further&mdash;the Minister introduced this matter into the debate and tried to denigrate the position&mdash;we find that for full time wage and salary earners incomes increased by 1.2 per cent between the September and December 1991 quarters. The spending power of the combined total income of households increased by 1.1 per cent. Wage and salary rates paid in all sections of the economy increased on average by 1.5 per cent during 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one analyses these figures and compares them with the things that have been put before us, we find that not only is the New Zealand work force better off under the changed system but the economy is also better off. New Zealand did not have a current account deficit in the last month. It would be a delightful thing for Australia if we could turn our position around, if we had the courage to take the steps that are required in industrial relations reform and economic reform to bring about similar changes in Australia. It is interesting that Senator Sherry has gone very quiet. The system in New Zealand, which he consistently denigrated in his response to my motion, has proved to be very successful, and it has created a new hope for New Zealanders&mdash;a hope that the one million people in this country who are unemployed have not got. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I have said in this motion is confirmed by what Commissioner Turbet said and by what President Maddern said in his annual report, which was tabled in this place some time ago: the Government adopts one position with the AIRC when it suits it; it adopts another position when it suits it. I have another letter that is worth commenting on, written by Mr Bob Smith, the Secretary of the Federation of Industrial, Manufacturing and Engineering Employees. It begins `Dear Brother Kelty', and he complains about the fact that Commissioner Merriman criticises the Government for the problems it had. I give honourable senators one example of what Commissioner Merriman said. He said that it was most likely the fault of the current Government. What does Bob Smith do? He goes running to Dear Brother Kelty. What does Dear Brother Kelty do? He goes running to Senator Peter Cook and, in essence, says, `Stitch up this commissioner because he dared to criticise you'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government cannot have it both ways. Either it supports the system and is straight and honest about it in the public arena or it does not. Our position is on the table and it is quite clear. On the one hand, the Government is trying in Question Time and in debate to fool us about its position. On the other hand, when it comes to the recommendations by the Remuneration Tribunal or in the national wage case, it adopts another position. It is a quite hypocritical stance.

It was ascertained as well earlier today that there was no change to the situation as of 3 April when the matter was discussed in Estimates Committee B. At that stage there had been no proceeds of assets sales for 1991-92. I asked Senator McMullan earlier today to refresh his memory as to whether there were proposed to be any sales between now and the end of the financial year. I think, again, the answer to that was no. Unless there is any change to that situation&mdash;we did have some informal discussion as to whether the Aussat sale may have affected that situation&mdash;then would I be right in saying that there will be a shortfall this year in the Budget revenue of $625m so far as the proceeds of the sale of assets are concerned?</PARA></TALK.START>

If that sale is the only item that will affect the bottom line of the assets sales figure for the outturn for the year, then whatever figure above $625m is published will presumably be the Aussat component.

Those changes were made not long after much of the work, in terms of the preparation of documentation for expressions of interest by potential buyers, had been done.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a bit early to say that but I am assured, as Senator Short would expect, that when the Government gets to make a decision about the mechanism of any proposed sale&mdash;whether it is of assets or whether it proceeds otherwise&mdash;it will be consulting with and seeking the cooperation of the board of ANL, not least because there are some legal requirements that we do so; but Senator Short would expect us to do so even if there were not. My understanding is that it is a bit early to get into that degree of detail, because we have not decided that we are going to sell any of the assets. That is not the only option, as I have said.

Without further explanation, it does seem that there is a real risk that, through the method of handling this ANL asset sale, unless the Government is disposing of the shares in the line, it is usurping from the directors of a corporation their legal and fiduciary responsibility for the control of both the purchase and disposal of the assets of that corporation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised from the press reports, and this has been confirmed by the officers, that the Gyles royal commission was critical of CIC's role in some matters which it examined. I am not aware of the full range or significance of those criticisms as yet, but they are being examined by the Government. The task force is looking at it and consulting with other relevant authorities to see whether that has any implications for what course of action we want to pursue from here.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Again, the situation might be clearer at the time of the next Estimates. I again express some concern at the total lack of any proceeds for asset sales, despite the work that has been done by the task force and others in the past 12 months. It is quite extraordinary that a government that has been trumpeting its ability to handle its financial management can go through a whole year with a great deal of effort with not one cent to show for it at the end of the year on behalf of taxpayers on such an important item.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I shall ask a couple of questions in relation to the Government's objectives in asset sales. So far as the question of employee share ownership is concerned, the Parliamentary Secretary may recall that we had some discussion about that during the Estimates hearings in relation to Australian Airlines and Qantas. It was established that, whilst employee share schemes are an objective in the case of sales for both Australian Airlines and Qantas, it is not a requirement as such. The question I want to ask is of a more general nature than just the airline sales situation. Precisely what is the Government's policy requirement so far as employee share ownership schemes are concerned in its ongoing asset sale or privatisation or corporatisation program?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is certainly a top priority so far as the Liberal and National parties are concerned that a privatisation program should have an appropriate and generous employee share scheme as one of its key requirements. I would have thought that a government of this Government's political persuasion would have had at least a similar policy requirement. There appears to be no such requirement. I would appreciate the Parliamentary Secretary's comments on that. If I am wrong, I would like to be directed to evidence to indicate that the Government does in fact have employee share ownership as a very important part of its overall policy objective. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question of employee share ownership remains an important objective for the Government in all the asset sales where that is appropriate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is going over the ground we went over in Estimates, but I think that Senator McMullan has added a different dimension. There is a considerable difference between employee share ownership schemes being an objective, as the Parliamentary Secretary said it was in Estimates Committee B, and it being a requirement. As I understand it from the Estimates discussions on 3 April, there is no guarantee that an employee share ownership scheme will be part of the sale of the shareholdings in Qantas and Australian Airlines. Indeed, it was made quite clear by Mr Heinrich at that time that that may or may not be the case. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Employee share ownership schemes are best and most easily handled in the context of a public float. That is simple. Whether we have a public float is not yet determined. We will certainly be discussing with prospective purchasers, in the context of what we are doing, the objective of the Government that employees should have shares in both airlines in due course.</PARA>
<PARA>Whilst an admirable objective, that answer contains nothing at all of a mandatory nature as far as employee share ownership schemes are concerned. Whilst I note what Senator McMullan said in response to me a moment ago, it does not seem to me that he has addressed the point I made and the question I asked, which is why&mdash;if I am correct&mdash;the Government does not have as a sine qua non of a privatisation process the incorporation of appropriate and, indeed, generous employee share ownership schemes, given the considerable benefits that I think he and I and most people would agree they incorporate. Is it because there has been a traditional dislike or distrust of such schemes by the trade union movement or are other reasons involved?</PARA>

The answer we got was very simply that Senator McMullan did not know and neither did the officers from Finance, and that, provided we had the officers from Treasury here who actually wrote the software for the model, we would be able to ask them whether it was exactly the same for the Fightback package and for the One Nation statement.

When Senator McMullan talks about distributional analysis, I suppose he is talking about the impact it has on ordinary Australian taxpayers. Of course, the One Nation statement does have an effect on ordinary Australian taxpayers. The fact that the Budget has blown out and the figures do not add up means that the things which were promised in that package will not be possible.

Obviously, the Government treats the Fightback package in one way and the One Nation package in another way.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Bishop and I, in a reservation to the report of Estimates Committee B, pointed out, as we did strongly in the Estimates Committee hearing, the absurdity and lack of impartiality and objectivity in the modelling. A quite different inflation rate was used to run through the modelling of the coalition's Fightback figures to that which was evident in the Fightback documents. As a result, the Government reached an absurd result on the impact on revenue and real wages. The modelling which was done and the inflation rate which was assumed led to the absurd result that the Fightback proposals were aiming for a fall in real wages of 3 per cent to 4 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>

Why was it that such a blatantly unprofessional result was obtained? Why was it that only one side of the ledger was looked at with respect to the implications of the inflation rates which were used? Why did the Government not take account of the impact on the revenue as well as the impact on the expenditure and, therefore, the impact on the ability and size on the tax cuts which the coalition's proposals automatically envisaged? Why was it that such a lack of professional approach could have occurred?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We had a very lengthy debate on this during the hearing of Estimates Committee B. I do not have anything to add to what I said then. I reiterate what was said at that time. The Treasury, in analysing the Fightback package, used the scenario C assumption which was in the supplementary paper No. 1. At that time, scenario C was being trumpeted around the place as the likely jobs outcome of the Fightback package. I assume that the Department was entitled to conclude that that was the basis on which it should draw. I understand that that was the only figure it could find in Fightback.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Kemp has pointed out, the statement Senator McMullan has just made is absolutely wrong, as was the statement which was made by the Treasury officers during the hearing of Estimates Committee B. It is quite clear and it is stated categorically in the Fightback document that there was a longer term price level increase of zero to 2 per cent in the coalition's proposals. Despite that, the Treasury chose to ignore it and assumed an inflation rate of 6 per cent to 7 per cent in its modelling. Of course, that led to a very distorted result and one which was absolutely unfair and discriminatory in the presentation that resulted by the Treasury of the Fightback package's proposal.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Department of Social Security also went on to say in its criticism of the Treasury analysis that it was done in such a way as to allow the Department to portray Fightback in the worst possible light.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a few points which are associated with the points put forward by my colleague, Senator Short. The matters he touched on raise a wider issue, and that is the use of the Treasury by the Government to conduct what is essentially a political exercise in respect of its political opponent. I think that is a very important issue. As I have noted in this chamber before, the Treasury is a great Department. The standing and authority of the Treasury are important in terms of the functioning of the government of this country. It is an extremely important institution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the greatest concern that, for the first time, the Treasury has allowed itself to be used for what is clearly a blatant political exercise. It is important to note that Dr Preston, when appearing before the inquiry into superannuation, conceded that a certain amount of work had not been done in this area because, as he said, the Treasury did not have the resources with which to conduct the exercise. Of course, the Treasury had the resources to conduct a major exercise and to do work on the Fightback program. But in the case of the Government's superannuation policies, it did not appear to have the time, the resources and presumably the people with which to conduct a proper analysis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that I would particularly like to raise with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) in the context of these estimates, and in relation to what Senator Short has said, is that one of the issues that came up during the hearings of Estimates Committee B&mdash;and I think this was confirmed on a number of occasions by Dr Preston&mdash;is that the office of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) gave many instructions to the Department in the conduct of its analysis of the Fightback document. </PARA>

In particular, in the astonishingly controversial choice of the 7 per cent inflation figure and the fall in real wages figure, did the instructions to use those figures come from the Treasurer's office? I would like that question to be answered so that it can be put on the record for all to see. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The problem with that particular answer is that, as I mentioned in the first part of my remarks, the Treasury allowed itself to be used for what was clearly, as Senator Short has said, a naked political exercise, a naked job on its political opponents.

They will have to wear that particular opprobrium for all time. I think that when a great department such as Treasury allows itself to be used for such a cheap political trick, it is going to become a subject of public debate. The tragedy of this is that the public, perhaps quite rightly, will assume&mdash;and the events in the days and weeks to come will sustain or deny the proposition&mdash;that the Treasury is not the independent body that keeps itself at arms length from government and is prepared to offer advice and, above all, prepared not to be used by governments for shabby political purposes. </PARA>

That led to the public indication of it by him. There is not really much more to add. As the information came in, it was assessed and reassessed. Of course, as Senator Short would know, the flow of data is such that one has to be mindful of the fact that what may be the first indication of a change may also just be a statistical blip or a one-off event.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Watson (Hansard page no. B358) asked:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What will the new ATO computer systems, to be implemented in July 1993, do in terms of identifying when a debt is due and payable, the aggregate amount and the ageing process?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Answer:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ATO's new integrated computer system, to be implemented in July 1993, will initially take on board the PAYE Group Employer and Sales Tax revenue lines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both of these revenue lines operate on the basis of the group employer or registered sales taxpayer self-assessing their liability to pay to the Commissioner amounts of tax instalment deductions (TIDs) deducted from their employees' salary or wages, or, in the case of a registered sales taxpayer, the amount of sales tax charged to a customer in respect of the sales of taxable goods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In most cases, for both PAYE and Sales Tax, the period of time for which a liability can arise is a calendar month. Thus, for group employers, a liability to pay to the Commissioner amounts of TIDs deducted from employees' salary or wages in a given calendar month normally arises seven (7) days after at the close of that month, that is, TIDs deducted in the month of April become due and payable on the following 7 May.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, with Sales Tax, a liability to pay amounts of sales tax charged to customers in a calendar month normally arises 21 days after the close of that month, that is, sales tax charged during the month of April becomes due and payable on the following 21 May.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the ATO's new computer system the due date by which a liability is expected to be received from a group employer or sales tax client will be recorded on their computer record for the relevant liability period&mdash;normally a calendar month. This due date can be extended by the Commissioner in accordance with powers provided under the relevant taxing Acts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of a number of important review processes undertaken by the new computer system the records of all clients will be periodically subject to examination to identify instances where clients have failed to carry out their obligations as required by law. These periodic reviews will normally be carried out on a weekly basis. However, some review processes are invoked on a daily basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of these periodic review processes will be to identify clients who have failed to acknowledge a monthly liability for either PAYE or Sales Tax. Because the laws relating to both PAYE and Sales Tax do not require a group employer or sales taxpayer to acknowledge a liability unless and until that person has actually made deductions of TIDs or charged sales tax, as the case may be, a calendar month may elapse in which that person is correct in not sending an advice of liability to the Tax Office. In order to identify those clients who have failed to acknowledge a liability that has actually occurred and those who have not sent an advice of liability because no liability actually exists, the new computer system provides for the recording of an estimated liability (based on historical, industry and seasonal patterns) for each client, for each liability period. This estimated liability value is recorded on the client's record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of the periodic reviews, client records are examined after the standard due date has elapsed, that is 7th of month for PAYE and 21st of month for Sales Tax. Where a client has an expected liability for that particular month recorded but no actual liability has been acknowledged the system will identify that client as a potential non-lodger and will issue a notice ( under s.14I of the Taxation Administration Act) requiring that client to provide information to establish the extent of their liability. This expected liability information may also be used to select certain categories of clients for field audit/inspection activities in an effort to quantify liability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the basis of the client's reply to the notice or the results of the field inspection a quantified liability will be recorded on the client's account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once a quantified actual liability is recorded on the client's account another function carried out by the periodic review process will be to identify those liabilities which are due and payable but which have payment (either full or partial) outstanding. This outstanding payments review function operates on two fronts&mdash;for clients who are already the subject of Debt Collection follow-up, and secondly, for those clients who by virtue of their failing to pay a liability are Debt Collection cases for the first time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clients who are already the subject of Debt Collection actions will have the latest accounting information recorded on the record downloaded to the ATO's Debt Collection case management system&mdash;COMPACT. All Debt Collection cases recorded in COMPACT are prioritised on the basis of the quantum of debt outstanding so that appropriate actions can be taken by staff in the Debt Collection areas to recover these debts. The COMPACT system provides a range of functions to Debt Collection staff so that they can monitor cases, resubmit them for re-examination at specified intervals as well as providing a range of facilities to generate notices, and other legal documents. Cases recorded in COMPACT are normally allocated to a particular Debt Collection officer (case officer) so that a one-to-one relationship can be established between the Tax Office and the client.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New Debt Collection cases which are referred to the COMPACT system for actioning are also given a priority&mdash;a debt level indicator. This priority is established by reference to the value of actual liabilities that a client has outstanding at the time of the running of the periodic review. Where a client has actual liabilities outstanding and has also failed to acknowledge a liability for a liability period where the system is expecting a liability, the value of the estimated/expected liability is also included in the calculation of outstanding liabilities for debt level assignment purposes. As with existing Debt Collection cases, new cases are assigned to a specific Debt Collection officer for appropriate follow-up actions with the client.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be noted that under the ATO's new integrated system a picture of a client's indebtedness, across all revenue lines for which that client has dealings with the Tax Office, will ultimately be available. The first release of the new system which caters for the PAYE and Sales Tax revenue lines will, however, initially limit the across revenue line picture to only those revenue lines. As other ATO revenue lines are redeveloped to come on board the new system they will also be incorporated into the aggregate picture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the question of the ageing of debts, the new system is being designed to provide an analysis of all debts by not only their age, but also by value, by revenue line, by debt type ie. primary tax debts and other tax debts and by branch office responsible for the debts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The design will specifically enable the Commissioner to satisfy the Financial Statements reporting requirements as set out in the guidelines issued by the Minister for Finance for the preparation of the annual financial statements. Under the guidelines, receivables as at 30 June, must be disclosed in accordance with an age analysis showing amounts overdue for less than 30 days, 30-60 days and more than 60 days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facility to provide an ageing analysis is planned to be available to ensure that ageing analysis is in place to satisfy the first full year of activity, i.e., 1993-94.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">1. The ATO has become aware of the lack of proper record keeping in the small business market segment through feedback from tax auditors involved in the audits of this segment. As such figures detailing exact numbers are not available. Business Audit Managers from all offices meet regularly to discuss, amongst other things, audit results.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The investigation did not identify evidence sufficient to prosecute any officer with any offences associated with connections to "mafia type" operations. As a result of this investigation it was found that two officers (both of whom have resigned) had possibly been involved in activity not directly related to the investigation. Investigations were conducted into these activities. As a result there is currently a matter involving one ex-officer with the DPP. This involves alleged offences arising from the conduct of a business by the officer (companies and associated offences) and the possession of ATO documents containing taxpayer information which we allege is a breach of S.16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not the case that more than 90 per cent of interest payments made under the Taxation (Interest on Overpayments) Act 1983 (IOP) are not paid within the required 30 days.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since this 1989-90 period, the ATO has significantly improved its performance in processing interest on overpayments.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not possible to meet the 30 day performance target in all cases because of the complexity of the calculation involved for some taxpayers and the need to obtain information from a variety of sources in order to carry out that calculation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the second question, it has never been the case that all taxpayers receive their interest payment up to the date of sending out the cheque. Under the IOP Act, the taxpayer has been and is legally entitled to interest up to the day on which the overpaid tax is refunded to the taxpayer (or applied against another liability) ie: to the day the amended assessment issues.</PARA>

This publication has been produced with the intent of assisting the taxpayers themselves to meet the requirements set down by the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act. We in the ATO have always considered that tax agents have access to more extensive material dealing with FBT such as CCH, Butterworths etc. For this reason we have not seen a need to produce extensive information of the type contained in the booklet specifically for tax agents.

This issue has been raised previously with the Australian Taxation Office who have indicated that each fund will be considered on a case by case basis. However, this is now an issue which should be given higher priority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Answer:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 272 of the Income Tax Assessment Act (the Act), in effect, deems non-resident superannuation funds, apart from `foreign superannuation funds' as defined in subsection 6(1) of the Act, to be residents of Australia. Therefore, if a non-resident superannuation fund has Australian resident members and/or receives deductible or rebatable contributions, it may be taxable on its world-wide income. However, the extent to which the assessable income of a non-resident superannuation fund will be taxed in Australia will be subject to any relevant Double Tax Agreement. Broadly, the Double Tax Agreements restrict Australia's taxing rights to certain Australian source income.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, it is important to recognise that Exposure Draft Taxation Rulings (EDRs) are not statements of the Australian Taxation Office's interpretive policy. They represent the preliminary, though considered, views of the ATO. EDRs may not be relied upon by taxation officers, taxpayers and practitioners. It is only final Taxation Rulings which represent authoritative statements by the Australian Taxation Office of its stance on the particular matters covered in the Ruling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">EDR 72 was produced to set out the ATO views as to the application of the decision of the High Court of Australia in FC of T v.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ATO accepts that the Westfield case was correctly decided on the basis of the conclusions of fact found by the Full Federal Court. However, EDR 72 states clearly that we do not accept certain comments of Hill J on one issue, viz. whether a profit must be made by the very means contemplated at the time of entering into an isolated transaction to be income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reasons why the ATO does not accept those comments were stated clearly in EDR 72 at paragraphs 44-45. We consider that the comments of Hill J quoted are obiter dicta and, therefore, not of binding authority. Furthermore, we do not accept that those comments are correct. We do not agree that the proposition made by Hill J is implicit in the High Court's decision in the Myer Emporium case, which is the leading case as to when a profit on an isolated transaction is income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ATO is not required to apply obiter dicta of the courts because such statements are not of binding authority. Although we consider dicta of the Full Federal Court to be of great weight in interpreting the law, we do not automatically apply them in every case e.g. if they are inconsistent with a decision of the High Court of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The approach taken by the ATO in EDR 72 does not mean that the self assessment system is fraught with danger. In this instance, the ATO has used the Ruling system (as it was meant to be used) to state the ATO view of the law and our reasons for that view. Consequently, taxpayers will know our view when they self-assess. If a taxpayer does not agree with the ATO's view that a profit on a particular isolated transaction is income, the taxpayer can dispute that issue under the objection and appeals provision of the law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We strongly reject any suggestion that EDR 72 is biased against business or is not balanced.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Liquidations</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) Section 160ZL concerns the return of capital on shares.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a view that section can apply to interim distributions made in the course of a liquidation. This is based on the view that an interim distribution cannot be taken as consideration for disposal of shares in a company in liquidation. This view seems to be inconsistent with the whole concept of a liquidation; surely once a liquidation has commenced any payment made by a liquidator is "in respect of" the pending disposal of the shares.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is suggested that to overcome this problem section 160ZL be amended to state that an interim distribution by a liquidator is not a return of capital for the purposes of that section, but rather is the consideration related to the disposal of the share.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) Double taxation may result on a liquidation where property is distributed to the shareholder by the liquidator. If the property which is distributed was acquired post 19 September 1985 the company being liquidated would be assessed on any capital gain on disposal (if the disposal qualifies for rollover relief under section 160ZZO it would be the shareholder company which would be taxed on that gain upon the eventual disposal by that company).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the liquidation will also result in the shareholder company disposing of the shares it holds in the company being liquidated. The value of the property being distributed would be consideration from the disposal of the shares and hence may give rise to a capital gain.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basic thrust&mdash;that to manage complex audit activity it is necessary to be better informed about the client base&mdash;is in accordance with ATO aims of using information systematically to determine the extent of non-compliance.

However, it maintains a long held view that existing review procedures in taxation matters before the Tribunal ensure that proceedings before the Tribunal in relation to the review of objection decisions or extension of time applications will be heard in private unless the person requesting the review or making the application wishes otherwise. The ATO holds the view that in taxation matters before the Tribunal  the principle of confidentiality should be maintained and that the anonymity of the taxpayer and other persons concerned (other than the Commissioner) should be maintained and that the identity of parties (other than the Commissioner) should not be disclosed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry, but I do not and cannot accept the fact that, once the court has made a determination and there is a conviction, that is the end of the matter. It is not a question of disciplinary action being part of the process. If the Australian Taxation Office makes a decision not to dismiss a thief and thinks it is proper to have him within the Tax Office, the Australian people might disagree. However, we will pursue that in another arena.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to move on to the question of the prosecution of Mr Smiles and the way in which the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the then Treasurer, has been treated by the Tax Office. When we are making an analysis of the way in which the Tax Office has treated Mr Smiles, we have only one instance on the record of how the Labor Party is treated to compare it with, and that is in relation to Mr Keating. I will get the letter in a little while so that it can be included in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. I reread the letter because it was not just one tax return which was outstanding; it was two tax returns. When I asked how many ordinary Australians were prosecuted for failure to lodge their tax returns in the last year, I got an answer that the number was in the vicinity of 10,800 people. In other words, 10,800 people who had no clout were prosecuted, but one person, who happened to be the Minister in charge of the Australian Taxation Office, got special treatment; there was no prosecution. In a moment I will ask about the nature of the penalty that most of those 10,800 people would have attracted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then I have to compare this treatment with the treatment of Mr Smiles. The dispute involves the question of apportionment; that is, an expense was incurred by way of employee wages and the taxpayer made a decision about what part of the wages was paid as assessable income and what part of the wages was designed for personal use. That is the sort of dispute that hundreds of Australians have with the Tax Office every year. I asked, in cases where the Tax Office chose to prosecute, how many prosecutions had in fact been brought under the Crimes Act as distinct from the Taxation Administration Act. I received an answer from the Minister. The answer is none. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then I took a look at the decision handed down in the Federal Court the other day concerning Mr Smiles's application regarding this prosecution. I read the headlines in the newspaper. When I read the judgment itself&mdash;and I might go upstairs and get that as well in a moment&mdash;I see that the judge said that the policy that the Tax Office has adopted of prosecuting so-called high profile people is not a fair or reasonable policy in the way it has been constructed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I then received a phone call about another question I asked concerning the report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> which said that 12 members of parliament in the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales had been investigated by the Tax Office. Two adjustments were made, from memory. I received an answer back from the Minister as to whether or not that was true. If it was true, I wanted to know how the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> knew about it. This is again the leaking Tax Office. The answer that the Minister gave me&mdash;and which is in this pile of papers somewhere&mdash;was that it was not 12 members of parliament; I was not quite accurate. It could have been 10, 11 or 15. Of course, when I ask for the figures, the Minister pleads section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act and cannot give us any information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, this phone call told me the other day that I was on the right track and that in fact I should ask the Minister to tell me the highest and lowest adjustments that were made following the investigations concerning members of the Legislative Assembly, and what the average was. I think the Minister can give me that information without breaching section 16 of the Tax Act. I ask the Minister to ask the officers to supply me with the highest adjustment made to somebody investigated, the lowest adjustment made and what the average was. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer to item 8 on page 2 of the report wherein the Committee noted with concern the differences of approach adopted by Ministers in attendance at Estimates committee hearings. On this occasion one Minister refused to accept any questions not directly and obviously relevant to the Additional Estimates. I am referring to the Minister on duty, Senator Bolkus, who would not even permit questions to be asked in respect to an audit report on the Department.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All I can say is that the Estimates Committee D hearing is best forgotten. The Minister decided to take a very narrow interpretation of the scope of the hearing and limited discussion to actual Additional Estimates. He allowed no peripheral discussion whatsoever, notwithstanding the fact that officers of the relevant departments were ready and willing to provide the information. He even refused to take questions on notice and instead suggested that they be put on notice in the Senate. The practical effect was that issues that had arisen between Budget Estimates and Additional Estimates and which would have been of interest to the Committee and the Australian public were gagged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier in the Estimates hearing the Committee adjourned to seek advice from the Clerk. Fortunately, the Deputy Clerk was at the hearing. From recollection, the advice given was that the guidelines did allow some latitude. It was pointed out, and agreed by the Chairman of Estimates Committee D, that this particular Committee had an excellent record and did not engage in frivolous time-wasting questions. The Minister, however, had made up his mind: there would be no questioning of any consequence whatsoever. As I mentioned earlier, he would not even permit questions on the Auditor-General's report on the Department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give another example. A perfectly legitimate line of questioning of the Australian Property Group, which was of an information seeking nature, was effectively stopped. In fact, a question on the terms of the leasing arrangements used by the Australian Property Group was again gagged, this time because the Minister did not wish the Committee to pursue arrangements concerning the leasing of ALP property to a major government department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague Senator Bishop pursued this issue in regard to the Auditor-General in the recent Estimates Committee hearings. However, I say quite properly that it really fits within Estimates Committee D, because the Australian Property Group negotiated that transaction. I intend to attempt to pursue that matter further. I have to say, out of a sense of propriety, that this exercise should never have been pursued in the first place. I will return to that point later. The hypocrisy of this whole approach to Estimates was breathtaking. I think the issue I referred to in regard to property will be clarified before the Appropriations debate is concluded this evening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past seven years I have served on Estimates committees with a range of Ministers, from Senator Walsh to Senator Ray, and I have never complained before. What Senator Bolkus did at the recent Committee hearings was not only a disgrace to himself; it also did untold damage to the functions and purposes of the Estimates committee system. It must have been a source of great embarrassment to other members of the Committee, who showed the lack of intestinal fortitude which has been a characteristic of this failed Government. It was the sort of display one would have expected to see in a failed totalitarian state and it was totally out of character with what is normally expected of a Minister of the Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was reported in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> as saying words to this effect and they are certainly true. Not only does this Minister wish to ban freedom of speech in the form of political advertising; he is also apparently determined to ban freedom in this Parliament. It was a very black day for the Estimates committee process and a black day for democracy in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have mentioned, it is not as though this particular Committee engages in frivolous or time-wasting questioning. A stopper was put on everything that was not directly related to the actual additional dollar estimates.

I understand that they are not the same as the Budget ones, but matters certainly do arise in the interim between one lot of Estimates hearings and another.

But there is no doubt that we cannot have these extremes, with some Ministers allowing wide ranging debate and others having a complete blackout.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a brief comment on what you have said, Mr Chairman, and also to  support the remarks of my colleague Senator Parer. In my experience in this Parliament, which is almost two years, from time to time we have had trouble on Estimates Committee D, largely because of what I would regard as strange interpretations by the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) of the guidelines which cover the sorts of questions allowed in Additional Estimates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not only a matter of consistency; I think we need a degree of common sense. All of us appreciate that in the context of the Additional Estimates, it is appropriate to apply some guidelines and rules. My experience, as I took part in a number of other Estimates committees, is that the Ministers showed, by and large, a degree of commonsense&mdash;they allowed a period in which some general matters could be raised and after a reasonable period the Committee returned to the particular matters which were listed for Additional Estimates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would just like to record that, in the context of Estimates Committee D, Senator Bolkus, I think for the second year in a row, chose to adopt what I regard as an unduly restrictive approach. I say `unduly' because I do not believe that any other Estimates Committee has a Minister that takes the approach that Senator Bolkus takes in this matter. I suppose that, in the context of the procedures available to us in this chamber, Senator Bolkus can act in that manner. I dare say that at some later stage&mdash;maybe not in the course of this evening but at some later stage in the progress of that Committee&mdash;Senator Bolkus's life can be made less comfortable than it may otherwise have been, if he wishes to proceed in this manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to give notice that I think that that Committee, from my experience&mdash;and I have been on it now for two years&mdash;has worked well. It is not a committee which takes a long time to get through the business. I think the issues are well canvassed, but they are not canvassed at any tedious length. It is very poor for Senator Bolkus to repay the courtesy and cooperative spirit of that particular Committee with his behaviour. It brings no credit on the commonsense of Senator Bolkus. I wish to record that, if he wishes to act in that manner, I would find it hard to see that that Committee could act in such a cooperative manner in the future. </PARA>

I can assure Senator Kemp that there is a great deal of commonsense on the Procedure Committee, so it would be looking at the commonsense approach.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not my role to stifle debate, but I do not think much more would be achieved by canvassing this issue at great length. Quite honestly, I can see the Committee's problem, but I can also see Ministers' problems. Definite guidelines have never been laid down for Ministers to follow; they have more or less grown up a bit like topsy. But the matter certainly will be addressed, because not only this Committee but also another committee has referred to the problem. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to comment on that point, Mr Chairman. I am pleased to see it is being addressed in this way. I think it is worth making the observation that those Ministers who are good Ministers, who are not frightened of information being received by senators or of being shown up as being inadequate, have a very sensible approach to the committees in that they find that a lot of the information that can be elicited by senators' questionings is in fact very useful for them. I do not think they are unaware of the fact that they can be snowed by their own departments. I have seen Ministers, such as Senator Ray, use the Estimates process very much to their own advantage. But I do find that where we have a poor Minister&mdash;and I mean a really poor Minister&mdash;we get obfuscation and a denial of committee members' opportunity for questioning, and I can only say that this is the sort of behaviour we have seen from Senator Bolkus.</PARA></TALK.START>

The point that Senator Parer is making that those documents could possibly be forthcoming right now is a relevant one.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Documents were requested from Senator McMullan and, through him, from the Australian National Audit Office. Steps were taken earlier this evening to present documents to the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Hill) in an attempt to show to him that some parts of documents that Senator McMullan was going to present, it was felt, had to have parts excised from them because some information was commercial in confidence. That is a normal practice of this chamber and this Parliament. Senator McMullan is currently endeavouring to locate the final set of documents. I anticipate that, as he has been requested to table some documents, he will come back to the chamber with documents and also with information as to the availability for tabling of the lease and the pre-lease agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier today, Senator Bishop gave me some notice about questions that she would ask me in respect of my responsibility in this area and asked whether I could answer those questions. I did not respond to the discussion at the outset of this Estimates Committee's hearings because my view on the role of Additional Estimates committees is on the record and, as Senator Kemp rightly said, it has been on the record for the second year in a row. It is a view that is sustainable. It is a view that has had support from the other side of the chamber from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we are dealing with additional estimates, then we are dealing with additional estimates; when we are dealing with appropriations, we have a full frontal approach to investigate a department's expenditure.

In arguing for that, I made it clear that my position was that the terms of reference of the Committee are such that we are limited to additional estimates. </PARA>

Senator Bolkus, before you do, I am certain that you would be cognisant of the fact that the information was asked of the Department of Finance under program 7, the Australian National Audit Office. I would expect that the information that was requested would be provided again under that program when we are discussing the Department of Finance. We will be able to go back to the Department of Finance by way of a motion when it is necessary. I do outline here that the matters for further consideration under the Department of Administrative Services relate to subprogram 1.1 and subprogram 3.7.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take your point. I agree with you that information that was sought earlier of Senator McMullan is very much the province of Estimates Committee B and Senator McMullan has that under control. However, in the earlier proceedings in this chamber some questions were essentially put on notice to be directed to me in respect of Estimates Committee D. To be consistent, I would argue that they were not before the chamber, nor were they before the Committee. However, in order to expedite proceedings and ensure that people leave this chamber satisfied that they have had information given to them on this matter, I seek your indulgence to give information which otherwise would not be required to be given to this Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In doing so, I advise that I was put on notice that I would be asked whether the Commonwealth has committed itself to a lease. I am informed that on 8 April 1992 the Australian Government Solicitor contractually committed the Commonwealth to the pre-lease and lease agreements of this property. I was also notified that I would be asked what is the average term for leases in the ACT. My advice is that the lease terms vary according to the individual requirements of client departments. Most major leases provide for a minimum base term of 10 years, with two options for an additional five years each. I am further advised that in the current property market where there is a scarcity of investors, developers are now requesting lease terms of 15 years before commencing new construction programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am further advised that financing demands this. In recent months a project in South Australia&mdash;the building of the Australian Taxation Office&mdash;was deferred for some time because of the insistence by financiers on a longer than 10-year term. The market is now demanding that terms of more than 10 years are entered into, and this agreement is consistent with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further question was asked as to why the Barton-Parkes area was chosen for expressions of interest. I am informed that a number of agencies and departments have expressed the desire either to relocate or to find additional space in that area. APG was responding to that interest. I am informed that the total possible demand for Commonwealth leases in the Barton-Parkes area was some 30,000 square metres. That included requirements from the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, the Australian National Audit Office, the Industry Commission, the Attorney-General's Department, the Public Service Commission, the Fisheries Service and the National Food Authority. The request for expressions of interest was first published on 27 October 1990. It solicited propositions ranging between 3,000 and 8,000 square metres. I will seek leave to table the relevant advertisement of the time. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Bishop is now dealing with me and I am now dealing with her. I am giving the honourable senator a comprehensive answer. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts report number 296, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Auditor-General: Ally of the People and Parliament</EMPHASIS> and dated 9 March 1989, states in the paragraph preceding the Committee's conclusion on this matter:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The issue of the Audit Office's location is timely since the Audit Office has been compelled to move from its central office in Canberra because of structural problems in the rented building. A new location must be found. Consistent with the report's concern with strengthening the links between Parliament and the Audit Office, there is a final recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to recommend:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Audit Office plan for a new building either within the Parliamentary Triangle or on State Circle adjacent to the new Parliament House, and that the building be called Audit House.</PARA>
<PARA>The Parkes-Barton area was chosen as the preferred choice by the Audit Office, and that reflected the recommendation of the Public Accounts Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next question that was signalled was: what are the rental levels for the various major areas of the ACT? We have received Australian Valuation Office advice which suggests that the rentals for the various areas are as follows: for Civic, $340 per square metre per annum; for Barton&mdash;the area that was preferred&mdash;$330 per square metre per annum; for Woden, $318; for Belconnen, $270; and for Tuggeranong, $220. Rentals in Barton, of course, are forecast to show the highest long term growth rates because the supply of land in that area is limited. There is high private sector and Commonwealth demand for the location, and it is a prestigious area as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next question that would have been put to me was: how does the rental for the subject building, the Lend Lease proposition on behalf of the Australian Labor Party, compare with the rest of the market? I am advised that the prime net rental is based on $280 per square metre as at 1 January 1991, escalated at a fixed percentage of 10.5 per cent till occupancy. I am further advised that outgoings have been estimated at $42 per square metre, and that this all up compares favourably with similar standard buildings in similar locations. In short, the comparable gross rental as at 1 January 1991 was $322 per square metre. I note, Mr Chairman, that the going rate for Barton was $330 per square metre per annum. So this is below the going rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also advised that, in comparing this rental with the average Barton rents, it should be noted that the Commonwealth negotiated a considerable contribution to fit-out and rent-free period due to integration of fit-out in the base building. The fit-out contribution is $400,000, and there is no rent to be paid during the construction of the fit-out. In essence, there was in fact a major saving to the Commonwealth from the fact that fit-out and no-rental levy during the construction of the fit-out are also covered by the owner of the building.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must stress this point: all agreed rentals have been based on advice from the Australian Valuation Office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In another question placed on notice I was asked: does this lease have dispute resolution provisions? I am informed that it does. The lease agreements have specific provisions for disputes to be referred to an arbiter or ultimately to a court. I was asked: does the lease provide for increases in annual rent? Yes, it does. The rent review provisions include annual rent escalations at 9 per cent per annum, calculated from the commencement of the lease, which is occupation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am advised that 9 per cent is very much the going rate&mdash;is it not? The long term growth rate valuation forecast is 11.61 per cent. So it is well below that. I was asked: are there lease terms and conditions yet to be fulfilled? I am advised that the lease terms and conditions have been fully agreed. As a requirement of the pre-lease agreement, the building must be delivered to specifications. I was finally asked: is there a penalty for not proceeding? The advice is that if the Commonwealth does not proceed with these agreements, it would be in breach of contract and liable for damages in accordance with contract law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other matters that should be adduced at this particular time. Outside the chamber I was asked at what stage the Australian National Audit Office first learnt that the ALP was the backer or was behind the Lend Lease proposal. I am informed by my Department, and through it by National Audit officers, that they recall discussing the proposal at a meeting on 29 November 1990, which is some two weeks after the close of expressions of interest. The Audit Office people cannot say whether the ALP involvement was discussed or not. However, they indicated that they also do not recall learning anything about it later, although clearly they did know about it by March 1991 and did not consider it a concern.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised that they probably did know at the November 1990 meeting about the ALP involvement in the proposal. At all material times they were aware of it. As I say, they did not consider it a concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of other things that need to be placed on the record. In terms of expressions of interest, the Liberal Party was so keen to get into this one that it beat the Labor Party by two days. There was an expression of interest on 13 November 1990 from Mr Tony Eggleton to provide the property and, as I say, on 15 November from Lend Lease on behalf of the Labor Party. I table both of those letters of expression of interest. One letter is from the Labor Party dated 15 November and the other is from the Liberal Party dated 13 November. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of these documents have excisions because they are commercial-in-confidence, but they have been discussed with the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. As to further documents, I do have copies of letters dated 7 December from Mr Robert Ireland, project manager, to the 14 proponents of properties, in response to the calling for expressions of interest. I table those documents. On 11 January 1991, minimum standards documents were forwarded to the 14 proponents, and I table those documents. On 21 January 1991, revised minimum standards were forwarded to the 14 proponents. I table the letter together with the list of those to whom it was distributed. The closing date for minimum standards was 1 February 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Invitations were sent out to meet with proponents on 25 March 1991. I table a copy of the invitation sent to Mr Tony Eggleton of the Liberal Party. Unfortunately, he did not front for the meeting. I have a timetable here of the times organised to meet with developers, and I table that. I also table the list of those to whom the timetable was sent. I table the Australian Property Group brief to ANAO dated 21 November 1990, with excisions for reasons of commercial confidentiality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I table a letter of 29 November 1990 from the Australian National Audit Office making it very clear that in a meeting of 29 November the proposal for the site opposite the National Press Club had been discussed, and that it was the preference.

As I say, Senator Parer might draw some major inference, some innuendo; he might, through his paranoid and suspicious view of the world and in his need to distort, decide that there was something sinister about Mr Collins taking a voluntary redundancy. I am informed that he was one of 54 who went. As Senator Parer knows full well, hundreds are going from that area of the Department, and in fact have gone.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a brief comment on what you have just said, Mr Chairman. Whereas technically you are absolutely correct, the point that I was making earlier is that I believe that the sort of questioning that we pursued in the Estimates Committee hearings was legitimate. The Minister may disagree with that. If we went down his route, the Estimates hearings would have lasted five minutes. This was a line of questioning that we went on. It was partly answered by one of the departmental officers and then chopped off. We can debate until the cows come home as to whether it was proper or not. Even though the questions were initially raised under the other Department, it was a contract that was negotiated by the Department of Administrative Services and we could argue into which category it fits.</PARA></TALK.START>

Now we have the situation where Domonic Collins, who was the principal negotiator for DAS property, is redundant and no longer in the Department. We have Penny Morris, who negotiated for the ALP.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RD4">Senator BROWNHILL</NAME><ELECTORATE>(New South Wales)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP> (1.39 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Tuesday night this week, in the adjournment debate, I raised some concerns I had about Australia Post's new charges. I made the point that country people are used to not having a full range and speed of services that their city counterparts enjoy. They are used to paying more for food, petrol and telephone. They are used to not having convenience stores and, in many cases, daily newspapers. I made the point then that most newspapers and magazines were bought and received on a mail subscription basis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cause for complaint was that magazines were now to cost more money. Magazines that cost 46c in 1990 would now cost 87c to metropolitan areas, 99c to country areas and $1.52 to interstate country areas. In other words, over an 18-month period the cost of mailing a magazine to country people had risen by 223.5 per cent. At a time when Australia Post is making annual profits of around $144m, I regard that as appalling, given that it is a monopoly service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since that speech, I have been contacted by proprietors of country newspapers who have told me a quite alarming story. They, too, have been caught by these new charges but they have had even further restrictions placed on them by Australia Post. It may be the end for some country papers. Declining sales and reduced advertising, caused by fewer rural businesses being able to afford to advertise, mean that their viability is very marginal. Now they have been told they are all to be a part of Print Post. Australia Post bills it as the new service for registered publications which will have significant advantages and revenue opportunities for publishers. Frankly, I cannot see any advantages at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia Post claims that the new system has been introduced because the former registered post arrangements were losing millions every year. What it means for newspapers is, firstly, that the outrageous hike in prices that I outlined for magazines will also apply to newspapers that are mailed to subscribers. A paper that was selling at a price of 60c and a postage of 45c has been costing $1.05 an issue. With the new charges, the same paper will now cost a minimum of $1.69. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is just the start of the additional cost because, under this Print Post system, newspapers can no longer be rolled for mailing as is the usual practice. The new arrangements will require newspapers to be flat folded and wrapped in plastic to a larger letter size of 360mm x 260mm x 20mm. This raises a number of difficulties. Firstly, the cost of plastic wraps will be far higher than the present paper strip band, the cost of machinery will be outside the budget of many country newspapers and even if machinery is not used, it will be a far slower and, therefore, more labour-intensive arrangement than the present system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, there are obvious environmental problems with plastic wrappers. At a time when each person in Australia produces an average of one tonne of rubbish every year, we ought to be encouraging less disposable rubbish, not more. Thirdly, the flat package restrictions will mean that some newspapers like  <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Land</EMPHASIS> newspaper will not always be able to meet the 20mm thickness criteria. Depending on supplements or bulky additions, they will simply be too thick to fold and too fat to post flat. I am also advised that postal workers hate these plastic wrappings because the packages tend to stick together, unlike the rolled newspapers which are easy to handle and to sort into bundles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Probably the most insidious part of all of this, however, is that Australia Post has already issued a brochure telling newspaper owners about the new arrangements. It is only from the fine print, however, that one realises that these new rules will not come into effect until 1 July 1993. That means there is still time for newspaper owners to object and protest. I urge every country newspaper from Tweed Heads to Tumbarumba in my State to get on the phone to Australia Post, write to Senator Collins and complain to their local member of Parliament. The other way they can protest is to make a submission to the Industry Commission's Mail Inquiry at PO Box 80, Belconnen, 2616. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is important that all newspaper owners object, and object strongly to this. It is an outrage, at a time when inflation is almost at zero and country people have been pushed to the brink of bankruptcy, that Australia Post tries to impose this. It has been done in a most underhand way and ought not to be tolerated. It may well be that the present category system for registered post is ineffective and uneconomic, but it is not the genuine regular newspaper that is causing the inefficiencies. The answer must surely be not to hit the country papers but, rather, review the method by which publications get special postage concessions. If that were tightened up, the present system, which is frankly expensive enough, could be retained. As I have said, country newspapers ought to seriously look at these new charges. If it is going to adversely affect them, they must speak up before it is too late. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7U4">Senator BELL</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Tasmania)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP> (1.44 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to note that the report of the Senate Select Committee on Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals in Australia was tabled on 23 August 1990. Nearly two years later, the Government has announced a response. Without commenting on that response, I draw the Senate's attention to recommendation 39 on aerial spraying. The Committee recommended the development of a uniform national approach to the regulation of aerial spraying of agricultural chemicals. The Government said in its response that it agrees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already alluded to an increasing number of complaints with regard to aerial spraying. The Committee heard some of those complaints. These complaints come from a number of sources. The obvious ones are neighbouring farms, houses, schools, businesses and people using affected common waterways. Tonight I draw attention to a group of people who are less obvious complainants and who currently face considerable difficulties having their cases dealt with. These people are simply road users. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No doubt honourable senators will be aware that farmers plant their crops right up to the boundaries along roads. At first that seems practical, but it makes the aerial spraying a very tricky business indeed. If we add to this the placement of electricity lines, commonly in the same direction as roads, we see straightaway that it takes some considerable aerial manoeuvring, even when using helicopters, to achieve a maximum cover of the crop. It could be said that it becomes impossible not to over spray the road. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a video in my office, taken on 6 March this year, which shows this problem very clearly. In that video we see that time and time again a pilot over sprays a road which has passing traffic. Cars and trucks are one thing, but three hours after the pilot has passed the road and the spraying is finished, a school bus comes along. It stops on the edge of the road, which is the usual place for a bus to stop, and lets out the children. They walk along the grass and then cross the road. Some days they leave their bikes there, pick them up and ride home&mdash;the bikes having been sprayed, apparently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Primary Industries and Energy was called to this case and samples were taken from the roadside. These have proven positive for chemicals, but no-one will divulge which chemicals are involved. As it was potatoes that were being sprayed at the time, it seems most likely that they were being sprayed with Dithane, a member of the Mancozeb family, commonly used in this area for these purposes. On such crops, spraying usually takes place every seven to 10 days. The children who picked up these chemical residues in this case could be doing so quite frequently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of this complaint to the Department, the only possible action that could be taken was to fine the pilot for over spraying the road. That could only be initiated by the owner of the road&mdash;another government department&mdash;and we are told it is being considered by the Public Prosecutor. The people affected, because they were on a road and not on private property, appear to have no avenue for action themselves. Even if they had been in the right place, officialdom moves painfully slowly, leaving people to suffer repeated incidences of chemical exposure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was by no means an isolated incident. I have more reports of over sprays of roads used by school buses. There are other incidents in which cars stopped on the side of the road were directly over sprayed, as were some people having picnics in the area. All of these events occurred in the north of Tasmania this year. I have no doubt it is only the tip of the iceberg, as many incidents go unreported due to the public's lack of faith in being able to actually get something done about this problem with our attitude and our usage of chemicals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will take more than the Government's friendly words to overcome this disenchantment that people have with the lack of getting</PARA>
<PARA>something done. What the people are really waiting for is action rather than words contained in a response almost two years after the date of the agricultural and veterinary chemicals report, which was tabled on 23 August 1990. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1, 2, &amp; 3) Past and current rabbit research has been undertaken mainly by CSIRO Division of Wildlife and Ecology and the government vertebrate pest agencies of the southern mainland states.  It would be a major undertaking to locate and collate annual information on rabbit research for the past 25 years and assign them to the requested categories.  Preliminary inquiries of some research organisations indicate that they could not readily provide the information especially for the 1970s.  In a partial answer to the Senator's question, the following information is provided for the Animal and Plant Control Commission (APCC) of South Australia, CSIRO Division of Animal Health and CSIRO Division of Wildlife and Ecology (CSIRO W&amp;E) and the associated Cooperative Research Centre on Biological Control of Vertebrate Pest Populations (CRC).

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1 &amp; 2) The Department of Primary Industries and Energy and other relevant Commonwealth departments and agencies, principally the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, receive reports on the consequences of the Chernobyl nuclear accident. The most comprehensive report received to date has been "The International Chernobyl Project" report in 1991 on the radiological consequences of the Chernobyl accident outside the immediate vicinity (the 30 Km "exclusion zone") of the reactor site.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report noted that in areas such as Orel and Bryansk, ground contamination was recorded at levels which prompted the then Soviet authorities to relocate some of the people living there. These levels were in the vicinity of 40 Curies per square kilometre (approximately 1500 kilobecquerels per square metre). The International Chernobyl Project team concluded that some protective measures taken at the time, including the relocations in those areas, generally exceeded what would have been strictly necessary from a radiological protection viewpoint.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the Chernobyl accident has had significant human and economic consequences, particularly inside the exclusion zone, the extent of its effects has often been  clouded by lack of sound evidence or misinformation. The particular report referred to above, however, has been acknowledged as one of the most reliable. It was prepared by an international advisory committee responsible for the work of the Project team comprising some two hundred scientists from twenty five countries and various international bodies, including the World Health Organisation. It concluded that, at the time of the project study, there were significant health disorders in the communities surveyed that were unrelated to radiation, but no health disorders that could be attributed directly to radiation exposure. It further assessed that it would be difficult to discern any future increase over the natural incidence of cancers or hereditary effects, even with large and well designed long term epidemiological studies. The report also stated that reported absorbed thyroid dose estimates in children were such that there may be a statistically detectable increase in the incidence of thyroid tumours in the future.</PARA>

Australia's contributions have been most notable in the fields of nuclear safety, in the negotiation of conventions that have been concluded on early notification of a nuclear accident and on assistance in the case of a nuclear accident or radiological emergency, and in current discussions on issues of nuclear liability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) I am aware of statements of this nature. The present level of demand for uranium is being affected to some extent by concerns about nuclear power but also by other factors affecting the supply/demand dynamics of the industry. Nuclear generating capacity worldwide is expected to show modest growth over the coming decade. Nuclear power remains an important source of energy, in the form of electricity, for several of our major trading partners.
