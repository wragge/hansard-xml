<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7U4">Senator BELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, the purpose of seeking to suspend Standing Orders is to attempt to move the motion which I introduced into the Senate yesterday in which I asked the Senate to note that the Tasmanian State Liberal Government, the Labor Opposition in Tasmania and the Green Independents in Tasmania, as well as the Federal Labor Government, Independent Federal members and the Australian Democrats, were in concurrence with regard to the need for fair negotiations to be conducted by all participants in the Burnie paper mill dispute.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In reading the rest of the motion, honourable senators will note that I distinguish several Federal Liberal members of parliament as not having concurred with the other members of parliament. I intended to use this opportunity to expose the hypocrisy which is evident in the position adopted by several Liberal members of parliament. While the word `hypocrisy' is somewhat overworked in this forum, it is self-evident in the actions and statements that have been made by a number of spokespersons on behalf of the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have several would-be shadow Ministers in the coalition. In addition to the Leader of the Opposition, who was very quick to support the APPM company in this dispute, we have had statements issued by Senator Crane, and by Mr Howard and Mr Miles, who are both members of the House of Representatives. Comments have been made, as one would expect, by Mr Smith, the member for Bass, and Mr Goodluck, the member for Franklin. At various stages they have offered either contradictory statements or, at least, statements which do not necessarily support the position that has been taken by Mr Howard, who is recognised as the Opposition shadow Minister for industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this is very hard to coalesce with the position taken by the Tasmanian Liberal Premier who, in what must be close to being a unique move, has found some concurrence with the position taken by a Labor Minister, the Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Peter Cook. On 30 May Senator Cook and Premier Groom issued a joint statement, headed `Enough Is Enough', stating that they want to see a resolution to the problem and challenging the quarrelling parties to take the opportunity of meeting together without acrimony and with a resolution as their goal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the occurrence of that near unique situation we were told by Mr Howard, speaking on behalf of the coalition, that governments should butt out of the APPM dispute. While the Premier of Tasmania is doing his darnedest to put aside political prejudices and promote the goal of resolving a dispute which is greatly affecting his State, and is wisely moving to support further negotiations, what does his Federal industrial relations spokesperson tell him to do? He tells him to get out of it. That is such a contradiction and such a confusing statement, which is probably the only result one could have when there is such a confused set of statements and policies coming from the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Groom was correct in saying that his policy in this area was one of never assuming that the company would always be right but, rather, of looking at the merits of the case and trying to find a resolution in that way. He is contradicted by such people as Mr McLachlan, from the other place, and, again, Mr Miles, who one would think would be fairly close to the dispute and understand the need to get back together and find a resolution for the sake of the community. But no, we have the continuation of petty, silly schoolyard tactics and bickering to the extent that resolution is impossible. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Quite distinct from the words in the Opposition's statement, we can now see what will happen in practice under its proposed legislation if it forms the next government. That demonstration is very much now open to inspection by the Australian people and it is very urgent that they have a look good look at it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the face of it, the idea of free and open contractual arrangements between employers and employees sounds very nice. It sounds very nice and very fair, and of course it may well be quite fair if we have fair and reasonable people acting in good faith on both sides. However, we all know that there are some people, on both sides I think one could say, who are unreasonable, who will make unreasonable demands and, therefore, a system of industrial relations does require reasonable levels of regulation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like Senator Archer and Mr Miles in the other place, I am resident on the north west coast. Unlike Senator Archer I have had a lot of discussions with the workers and their families involved in this dispute. The reason that they are involved in this dispute is that, without any talks at all, the company unilaterally bludgeoned them and said, `We are taking away some of your over-award wages and conditions'. There was no discussion. The company said, `We want to discuss this issue with you as individual workers'. Those individual workers, collectively, through their democratically elected representative, said, `We do not want to discuss this dispute with you individually. We have our unions and we have faith in those unions'. That principle has stuck throughout this dispute.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason the strike was provoked was that the company misinformed the police, brought the police on site and had five workers arrested while they were at work. `Misinformation' is not my word; that is the word used by the Liberal State Minister for Police, Mr Madill, who criticised the company for continually misinforming and misusing the police. That sparked the strike and the walk-out and caused the dispute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Archer calls for the workers to sit down with the management, but the workers want to sit down collectively with their democratically elected representatives to discuss these issues. They want the legal actions withdrawn. They want the actions for trespass, while they were at work&mdash;which frankly I do not think will succeed in the courts&mdash;withdrawn. They want the decision for bona fide and legitimate discussions between workers and their representatives and the management to continue. But the company refuses. Its attitude is, `We will deal with individual workers as we want and we will do what we want unilaterally'. There has been no legitimate discussion.

As Senator Parer pointed out, Senator Cook went down there and marched into town at high noon with guns blazing. He was going to sort this issue out like Hawkie used to do in the early 1970s. Cookie was back in town. But what happened? It was a total and absolute disaster. Senator Cook went there and inflamed the dispute, then came back into this Parliament and tried to further inflame it by speaking about bloodshed in the streets and so forth.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i)submission by the Life Insurance Federation (LIFA) in relation to life office fees, commissions and charges.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I seek leave to move a motion that the Senate take note of this report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Deputy President,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation is currently addressing one of the key long term issues confronting the present and future generations of Australians. The Committee has been given a comprehensive set of terms of reference which include an examination of two matters which impinge on the activities of superannuation funds and insurance companies selling superannuation products in respect of information to members and the level of fees, commission and charges.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I particularly refer to terms of reference (g) and (h) which read as follows:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(g)the level and structure of fees and commissions charged in relation to superannuation fund membership and asset management; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(h)the information available to members of superannuation funds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee commenced its inquiry into these matters by calling for written submissions. Unfortunately, the depth and breadth of evidence on these terms of reference was most disappointing. With the exception of a small number of submissions very little reference was made to the level of fees and commissions. Almost no details of precise charges etc were given at this stage of the inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consequently, the Committee used the public hearing process to obtain the information necessary to report on this matter. It was here that considerable difficulty was experienced and it was at this point that the Committee knew it would not be receiving unequivocal support and assistance of certain witnesses appearing before it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, the Committee had to debate the "need to know" question with the insurance industry contesting the relevance of the level of fees and commissions to the inquiry's terms of reference saying that they were reluctant to disclose an agent's commission because it was only one aspect of an insurance contract.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When pressed, LIFA undertook to conduct a survey and get detailed figures on fees commissions etc from individual companies and provide the information on a "confidential basis".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At hearings subsequent to LIFA's appearance, a number of life offices undertook to provide information on fees, commissions and charges but, either at the time of the request or informally at a later time, indicated that LIFA would coordinate the exercise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Four months elapsed before LIFA provided the Committee with details of its survey. The Committee has considered the LIFA submission and, having regard to the time which was allowed for its preparation and the specificity of the Committee's request, the document is extremely disappointing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee needs information which displays for each company that participated in the survey and/or appeared before the inquiry, details of products or plans and the respective fees, commissions and charges, i.e. a matching of company, product and fees, commissions and charges. When this information has been received, the Committee could then determine whether it needs further information from LIFA or one of its member organisations to explore the reasons for any significant differences in the level of fees, charges and commissions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is for the preceding reasons that the Committee has sent a strongly worded letter to LIFA which I have just tabled requesting that the information be provided and reminding it of the powers that the Committee has under Senate Standing Orders, Senate Parliamentary Privilege Resolutions of 25 February 1988, and the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 to obtain the information for the purposes of its inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The information provided by LIFA in the document intensifies the Committee's interest in the matter of fees and commissions for the following reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firstly, the survey reveals that commissions can be as high as 80 and 20 per cent during the first two years of a superannuation policy's life. This could mean that a contributor, should he or she wish to transfer a policy or cash it in would receive precious little of contributions at the end of two years of a policy. A number of witnesses have given evidence on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second issue is that of vesting of benefits. No clear indication is given in the survey about the vesting policies issued by life offices. The survey merely says that it "varies, but is basically related to the period over which commission is paid". The Committee expects that the lack of specific detail and the apparent vagueness of the survey on this matter will be rectified when the next submission is prepared.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I need not remind Senators of the impact that fees, commissions and charges can have on superannuation plans, especially when they impact on front end accumulated savings. It is for this reason that the Committee has pursued terms of reference (g) </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and (h) with a degree of vigour which might not be to the liking of the life assurance industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee looks forward to reporting in detail on the matter of fees and commissions when it presents its final report to the Senate in September 1992. I commend this report to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your submission dated 18 May 1992 regarding the fees, commissions and charges applicable to the superannuation products of your member life offices. The Committee has considered your submission and decided that it should correspond further on the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You will recall that when you appeared before the Committee on 11 February 1992, the Committee requested that it be provided with `detailed figures on fees, commissions etc. from individual companies' (<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> page 302). Following that request, you undertook to survey the companies and `get that information on a confidential basis' (ibid). At hearings subsequent to your appearance, a number of life offices undertook to provide information on fees, commissions and charges but, either at the time of the request or informally at a later time, indicated that LIFA would coordinate the exercise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee requires the information in question in order that it report to the Senate on terms of reference (g) and (h) which read as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(g)the level and structure of fees and commissions charged in relation to superannuation fund membership and asset management; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(h)the information available to members of superannuation funds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In reporting on these terms of reference, the Committee wishes to collect as much primary source data as possible from a range of life offices and superannuation funds covering the full range of superannuation products which accurately represents the fees, commissions and charges that are applicable to each plan. Having collected the data, the Committee then intends comparing the various fees, commissions and charges on a product and company basis and identifying issues which may be examined by way of further written evidence or by the appearance of witnesses before the Committee. In making decisions in this regard the Committee would maintain its stance of protecting material received on a confidential basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee believes that your submission of 18 May 1992, whilst it provides a useful overview of the level of fees, commissions and charges in the life industry, does not fully satisfy its original request. Accordingly, the Committee needs information which displays for each company that participated in your survey and/or appeared before the inquiry, details of products or plans and the respective fees, commissions and charges, ie. a matching of company, product and fees, commissions and charges. When this information has been received the Committee could then determine whether it needs further information from LIFA or one of its member organisations in order to explore the reasons for any significant differences in the level of fees, charges and commissions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst the committee fully appreciates that the nature of the competition in your industry to a large extent dictates that there will be product differentiation and associated differences in remuneration to agents and others involved in marketing activities, it believes that the provision of the material as outlined in this letter will be of benefit to its consideration of the issues and will thereby assist in reporting on the terms of reference.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Committee has been waiting for almost four months for this information to be supplied, and having regard to the fact that its final reporting deadline is fast approaching, the Committee requests that this matter be given high priority by both LIFA and the life offices concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The information required should be forwarded to the Committee Secretary by the close of business, 12 June 1992. Should the information not be forthcoming, the Committee will use its powers under Senate Standing Orders, Senate Parliamentary Privilege Resolutions of 25 February 1988, and the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 to obtain the information for the purposes of its inquiry.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report and documents.</PARA>
<PARA>The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation is currently addressing one of the key long term issues confronting the present and future generations of Australians. The Committee has been given a comprehensive set of terms of reference, which include an examination of two matters that impinge on the activities of superannuation funds and insurance companies selling superannuation products in respect of information to members and the level of fees, commissions and charges. I particularly refer to terms of reference (g) and (h), which read as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(g)   the level and structure of fees and commissions charged in relation to superannuation fund membership and asset management; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(h)   the information available to members of superannuation funds.</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee commenced its inquiry into these matters by calling for written submissions. Unfortunately, the depth and breadth of evidence on these terms of reference was most disappointing. With the exception of a small number of submissions&mdash;usually complaints&mdash;very little reference was made to the level of fees and commissions. Almost no details of precise charges et cetera were given at this stage of the inquiry. Consequently, the Committee used the public hearing process to obtain the information necessary to report on this matter. It was here that considerable difficulty was experienced, and it was at this point that the Committee knew that it would not be receiving the unequivocal support and assistance of certain witnesses appearing before it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, the Committee had to debate the `need to know' question with the insurance industry, contesting the relevance of the level of fees and commissions to the inquiry's terms of reference and saying that it was reluctant to disclose an agent's commission because it was only one aspect of an insurance contract. When pressed, LIFA undertook to conduct a survey and get detailed figures on fees, commissions et cetera from individual companies and provide the information on a confidential basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At hearings subsequent to LIFA's appearance, a number of life offices undertook to provide information on fees, commissions and charges but, either at the time of the request or informally at a later time, indicated that LIFA would coordinate that exercise. Four months elapsed before LIFA provided the Committee with details of its survey. The Committee has considered the LIFA submission and, having regard to the time which was allowed for its preparation and the specificity of the Committee's request, considers the document extremely disappointing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee needs information which displays, for each company that participated in the survey and/or appeared before the inquiry, details of products or plans and the respective fees, commissions and charges&mdash;that is, a matching of company products and fees, commissions and charges. When this information has been received, the Committee can then determine whether it needs further information from LIFA or one of its member organisations to explore the reasons for any significant differences in the level of fees, charges and commissions. It is for the preceding reasons that the Committee has sent a strongly worded letter to LIFA, which I have just tabled, requesting that the information be provided and reminding it of the powers that the Committee has under Senate Standing Orders, Senate Parliamentary Privilege Resolutions of 25 February 1988 and the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 to obtain the information for the purposes of its inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The information provided by LIFA in the document intensifies the Committee's interest in the matter of fees and commissions for the following reasons. Firstly, the survey reveals that commissions can be as high as 80 per cent, and 20 per cent during the first two years of a superannuation policy's life. This could mean that a contributor, should he or she wish to transfer a policy or cash it in, would receive precious little of contributions at the end of two years of a policy. A number of witnesses have given evidence on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue is that of vesting of benefits. No clear indication is given in the survey about the vesting policies issued by life offices. The survey merely says that it varies but is basically related to the period over which commission is paid. The Committee expects that the lack of specific detail and the apparent vagueness of the survey on this matter will be rectified when the next submission is prepared. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I need not remind honourable senators of the impact that fees, commissions and charges can have on superannuation plans, especially when they impact on front-end accumulated savings. It is for this reason that the Committee has pursued terms of reference (g) and (h) with a degree of vigour which might not be to the liking of the life insurance industry. In terms of this inquiry and the year over which it has been conducted, we have pursued all our terms of reference with the utmost vigour in order to prepare a thoroughly comprehensive report with appropriate recommendations. I and the Committee are determined that we will obtain the details of fees and commissions from the industry. The Committee looks forward to reporting in detail on the matter of fees and commissions when it presents its final report to the Senate in September 1992. I commend this report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL (No.3) 1992</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill gives legislative effect to a registration scheme for migration agents designed to improve standards of professional conduct and quality of service. I announced the proposed establishment of the scheme on 11 December 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The registration arrangements are expected to begin operation in mid-September of this year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They are to apply to agents operating in Australia and involve defining a migration agent, establishing a Migration Agents Registration Board and adopting a code of conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This initiative reflects the Government's concern over the level and nature of complaints made against incompetent or unscrupulous agents, complaints which would be familiar to many members of this chamber. It also recognises the fact that many of those who are likely to seek the assistance of agents are among the most vulnerable in our society, sometimes having a poor grasp of English, fear of authority or meagre financial resources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is not to say that the great majority of agents are not honest and efficient. It is a sad fact of life that the activities of a minority has tended to tarnish the reputation of migration agents as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not intend to list comprehensively problems which led to the development of the scheme but some examples include agents having been paid to lodge applications and then failing to do so; lodging applications without paying the prescribed fees thereby not giving effect to the application; lodging applications tardily in a way which adversely affects the entitlements of applicants; and holding passports as "security" and then demanding extra payments. There are also examples of agents providing incompetent advice because they lack even a rudimentary knowledge of the Migration Act and Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These problems are not new ones and there have been attempts by previous governments to find legislative remedies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Up to December 1989 a registration procedure existed which required persons wishing to practise as migration agents to notify the Secretary of my Department. This practice provided no real basis for regulating the activities of migration agents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government sought to strengthen migration agent provisions in December 1989 when major amendments were made to the Migration Act, following its consideration of the recommendations of the Committee to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies (CAAIP). These amendments required migration agents not to engage in false advertising, to provide statements of accounts to clients and to not misrepresent their relationship with the government and the Department. They were underpinned by appropriate penalty provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While these were worthwhile initiatives, experience has shown that they have not gone far enough in addressing the problems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, the Government had to look at formulating a more comprehensive means of regulating migration agents. This was not an easy task given the complexity of the problems and competing interests involved. I also understand that Australia is the first country with a major immigration program to introduce regulatory arrangements of this kind.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government considered a range of options and carried out extensive consultations with the Migration Institute of Australia, ethnic community organisations, community based migration advice agencies and the legal profession. These consultations have been very fruitful and an important step in the development of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The possibility of self-regulation was considered but rejected. This was because self-regulation assumes the existence of a well-organised and clearly identified group of individuals and corporations engaged in an activity. The reality is that there is a high level of fragmentation with professions organised into their own distinct associations, with a significant number of persons acting alone.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consideration was also given to a system where agents could practise unless specifically barred or, in more technical language, negative licensing. This approach was rejected for a number of reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government was concerned that the lack of contact with migration agents involved in negative licensing would have posed significant difficulties. These included ensuring that people recognised when they were operating as migration agents, understood the code of conduct and the need to adhere to it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government also took the view that migration agents should meet the cost of regulation because they were likely to benefit from the development of a more cohesive and reputable industry, in the medium to long term, and because of the need for budget discipline. Part of the revenue from the registration fees will be provided to community based migration advice agencies. Fee levels are dealt with in the accompanying tax Bills.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was a need to minimise the risk of anti-competitive behaviour that might result from restricting entry into the industry. This has been achieved in a number of ways.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Resources will be directed to the investigation of complaints rather than erecting in the legislation entry barriers at too high a level. The composition of the migration agents registration board has been deliberately mixed so that both industry and consumer interests are represented. Disclosure of interest provisions has been made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I turn now to the details of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A central feature of the scheme is the establishment of a Migration Agents Registration Board, which will have the power to issue warnings, to suspend, to deregister and to refuse applications for registration. It will comprise ministerially appointed representatives from industry, the legal profession, the ethnic community (which has a strong consumer interest in the services provided by migration agents) and the Immigration Review Tribunal. It will be chaired by the Secretary of my Department or a nominee of the Secretary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Applications and any consequential investigations will be conducted in the strictest confidence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The registration process has been designed to allow fast-tracking of applicants by the Secretary of my Department. However, this can occur only in accordance with carefully specified circumstances involving little discretion. If any of a range of concerns are triggered, such as complaints being lodged against an applicant or questions of character being raised, then the board must deal with the case. Nevertheless, I consider that most applications will be able to be approved under the fast-track route.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A registration process involving basic checks of integrity will be introduced. To be eligible for registration an applicant must be at least 18 years of age; be an Australian citizen or an Australian permanent resident; be a person of integrity; and meet certain other entrance requirements. The applicant also must not be an undischarged bankrupt and must endorse a prescribed code of conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Members of the public will have the opportunity to lodge complaints within a six week gazettal period before applicants can be registered. After registration the public will be able to lodge complaints at any time and will have the benefit of the code of conduct to guide their expectations of agent behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I referred above to a code of conduct. This is a critical element of the scheme. This document is still subject to refinement in the light of ongoing consultations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The code will go beyond a listing of general objectives often associated with such a document. It will delineate a range of unacceptable behaviour to provide a guide to agents and consumers alike. While the code explicitly does not seek to be exhaustive, its scope will be such that it would be difficult for those acting unprofessionally or unethically to claim ignorance as a defence. This should make it easier for the board to perform its functions and deter unacceptable behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The code will be prescribed by regulation. It will be capable of adjustment in response to input from migration agents and consumers alike.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Decisions on registration have the potential to very significantly affect the livelihood of individuals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, the Bill allows for appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal where agents are dissatisfied with adverse decisions by the board.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has carefully considered the activities which should be regulated by this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Broad definitions have been adopted to minimise avoidance. In essence, a migration agent is defined to be a person who uses knowledge of, or skill in, migration law and procedure to assist in the making of an application for a visa or entry permit or for refugee status. It extends to advice and assistance relating to adverse decisions on applications, whether in a court or before review bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I note that the qualification of knowledge and experience is an important one because it excludes those providing more mechanical assistance, such as typists and interpreters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of the significant role played by solicitors and barristers in providing immigration assistance those who provide such assistance will need to apply for registration. Clearly, a regulatory scheme which missed these members of the legal profession would be deficient.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There also have been concerns that serious complaints have been made against some members of the legal profession without its self-regulatory mechanisms responding with adequate timeliness or vigour.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Solicitors and barristers will not need to register in respect of their activities before the courts or if they are providing general legal migration advice unrelated to the completion and lodgment of applications. Registration will, however, be required in relation to the making of visa or entry applications under the migration Act. The board also will be able to investigate complaints against lawyers arising from the provision of immigration legal assistance  to allow cases to be effectively referred to professional associations for possible disciplinary action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to make one further point on the extension of this scheme to some activities of the legal profession.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The registration arrangements proposed by the Government will be evaluated after two years. While there will be a range of issues that will need to be carefully considered at that time, the government will closely examine any progress made by the legal profession in strengthening its self-regulatory mechanisms. In the meantime, the Government hopes to maintain a close dialogue with the legal profession which made some useful contributions to the development of the scheme, although it opposed any coverage of barristers and solicitors. Similarly, the Government will continue its close dialogue with the Migration Institute of Australia which has already taken steps to develop training courses and a fellowship scheme that promises to lead to higher professional standards and improved self-regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The scheme is backed up by tough penalties reflecting the Government's concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would now like to turn briefly to a number of implementation issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has been concerned not to disrupt the activities of migration agents, many of whom offer a valuable service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will be facilitated by the fast-track provisions that I referred to earlier.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The transition provisions also have been framed to allow those who are currently practising as migration agents to lodge an application and to continue practising while their applications are being determined. This is because, like most such schemes when they are introduced, there initially will be a large number of applications needing to be determined.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order that consumers and agents alike are aware of the scheme, extensive publicity is planned. Steps will be taken to provide agents with advance warning of changes to the code of conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conclusion, this Bill arises because of problems that former legislative measures and self-regulation have not been able to remedy. Accordingly, the Government is taking on that challenge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the introduction of this regulatory scheme may well act as a catalyst in drawing together migration agents in a way which will encourage self-regulation and provide future governments greater flexibility in addressing the underlying issues. This is reflected in the sunset provisions of the Act and my comments on the review of the scheme at the end of a two-year period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the explanatory memorandum for the Bill and commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition will not be opposing the passage of the Trade Practices Amendment Bill 1992, which at last clarifies the long confused position in Australia with respect to product liability. The de facto international standard with respect to product liability is contained in the European Community directive of 1985.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's basic approach, with which the Opposition agrees, is that Australian consumers who are injured by defective goods should be placed in a position which is no less advantageous than that enjoyed generally by their European counterparts in the same situation. A fundamental part of the EC directive, contained in article 4, is that the onus of proof is on the claimant. Article 4 states that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The injured person shall be required to prove the damage, the defect and the causal relationship between the defect and the damage.</PARA>
<PARA>The coalition has always supported this approach and has consistently expressed serious reservations about any proposal which tampers with the onus of proof. If manufacturers' products are assumed to be defective unless they are proved to be otherwise, it imposes an unreasonable burden on manufacturers and would lead to higher insurance premiums and product costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the European Community directive of 1985 on product liability, the issue has been under examination in Australia. It has been the subject of reports by the National Consumer Affairs Advisory Council, the Australian Law Reform Commission and the Industry Commission. The Australian Law Reform Commission in its 1989 report recommended a system of strict liability which would shift the allocation of loss to manufacturers. In March 1991 the coalition welcomed the Government's decision&mdash;two years in coming&mdash;that it would not accept the ALRC's 1989 proposals. We recognised the need for a balance to be struck between the right of consumers to recover damages for injury suffered as a result of defective products and the need to ensure that any proposal adopted did not unnecessarily adversely affect manufacturers and act as a potential disincentive to manufacturing investment. Since then the Government has struggled to find the right balance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1991 the Minister for Justice, Senator Tate, announced a proposal that he called a compromise position, in which the onus of proof was to be shared between the claimant and the defendant manufacturer. What he was proposing was a reversal of the onus of proof, relying on the conclusion reached by the Industry Commission that it would be more economically efficient to require the manufacturer to show that a defect does not exist. Although Senator Tate maintained at the time that this proposal represented the de facto situation in Europe, in our view it clearly did not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In November last year Senator Tate announced that the Bill would be redrafted so that, where all the circumstances of an injury point to a defect in the product causing the damage, that inference should be drawn. This proposal was reflected in the Trade Practices Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991, which was introduced in December. The Opposition was still not satisfied with this revised proposal, although it was encouraging that the Government appeared to have abandoned its attempt to reverse the onus of proof. However, the revised proposal still imposed an unnecessary burden on manufacturers and, moreover, it was still not in line with the EC directive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister put forward yet another revised Bill in April this year. This proposal was a variation on the theme of drawing inferences, where in all the circumstances it is reasonable to infer that loss was caused by a defect in goods. Once again, the Opposition could not support the proposal because, if the law in Australia is to match that under the EC directive, the onus of proof should simply be on the plaintiff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the end, good sense prevailed, and the Minister was brought to task by his backbench caucus committee, which took the view that the onus of proof ought not to be on the manufacturers. As I indicated, Senator Tate was forced to withdraw those provisions. As we read the Bill now, in its much revised final form, the onus of proof is on the claimant, in line with the EC directive. The Bill is therefore acceptable to the coalition and we will not be opposing its passage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill amends the Trade Practices Act by introducing a new part VA, which provides a regime of strict liability. A person who is injured or dies or suffers property damage as a result of a defective product has a right to compensation against the manufacturer. The claimant need not prove negligence on the part of the manufacturer. Pursuant to proposed section 75AC, goods have a defect if their safety is not such as persons generally are entitled to expect. In assessing safety, regard is to be had to all the relevant circumstances, a number of which are specifically provided in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pursuant to subsection 75AC(3), a product is not to be inferred to be defective simply because, after it was supplied, safer goods were provided. That is sensible. Although the regime is one of strict liability, we note that a number of defences are provided. They appear to be appropriate. Proposed section 75AL provides further that, where a defendant raises the defence that goods were defective only because of compliance with a Commonwealth mandatory standard, the defendant must then serve a notice of action on the Commonwealth. In such cases, it will be the Commonwealth and not the manufacturer who is liable to compensate the aggrieved consumer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proposed section 75AN provides that contributory acts or omissions by the claimant will reduce the amount of compensation payable by an appropriate amount. That seems to be a proper provision. A limitation period of three years is provided for in proposed section 75AO, and time begins to run from when the person became aware, or ought reasonably to have become aware, of the alleged loss. The action must commence within 10 years of the supply of the defective goods by the manufacturer. I think the Minister was seeking 20 years but has been brought back to a more reasonable period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proposed section 75AQ provides that the Trade Practices Commission may commence an action on behalf of one or more persons who have suffered loss, provided that the written consent of each person is obtained. Such a form of representative action also seems to be sensible in the circumstances. Pursuant to proposed section 75AR, the operation of other laws and remedies is preserved. There has been some public debate about that. It means that a manufacturer would have to look to obligations in contract and tort under part II of the Trade Practices Act and now part VA. From time to time we have questioned whether that is not becoming unreasonable. Nevertheless, we have decided not to press our objection on this occasion. There would seem to be little doubt that this provision will overtake most of the other remedies available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the coalition welcomes the Government's acceptance at long last that the onus of proof should rest with the claimant, as is the case under the EC directive, and not with the manufacturer. We only regret that the Government has taken such a tortuous path in coming to the position which the coalition has consistently maintained since the issue of product liability first emerged years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that three of the matters are still on the agenda for public debate. They received earlier support from Senator Tate. He is now proposing that they should go to a Senate committee for further examination at an appropriate time. These include the question of extraterritoriality, giving overseas consumers the right to sue Australian manufacturers over defective products; the period of repose&mdash;a delightful expression&mdash;which the Minister believes should be up to 20 years after manufacture to allow complaints to be made; and the so-called Aussie battler provision&mdash;another delightful expression&mdash;which is designed to ensure that when a consumer's claim is reasonable he or she should be guaranteed his or her day in court. It seems to be a last gasp attempt by the Minister to reintroduce some further inference provision in the Bill, such as that which has been taken out by his colleagues and which we have argued for a long time should be taken out. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats will also be supporting the passage of the Trade Practices Amendment Bill 1992 with reservations, which I will outline in the course of my contribution to the debate. It is important legislation, which is the first thing to be said about it. In demonstrating that it is important legislation, I will be showing that it has been a long time coming, and expressing severe reservations about it. It has been a long time coming. We have known for a considerable length of time that there are problems with product caused injury. These problems have begun to be articulated and documented as part of the moves towards appropriate legislation for product liability and consumer protection thereby.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1985-86 a survey of consumer opinion was conducted for the Trade Practices Commission. It found that in the few years preceding that survey 7 per cent of respondents or members of their households had suffered physical injury or illness as a consequence of goods, and 3 per cent of this number regarded the injury as resulting in permanent incapacity of some kind. A much larger proportion had some complaint about the quality or performance of goods. In relation to injury, illness and incapacity, it has been estimated that the figures indicate around 10,300 permanent injuries or illnesses for the whole of Australia for the few years covered by the survey, and around 500 deaths for the same period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Consumers Association put out a report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">An Arm and a Leg</EMPHASIS>, early in 1989 which resulted from the survey work that was done in the preceding years. It was also a national injury surveillance and prevention project&mdash;a pilot scheme gathering data from the casualty departments of selected hospitals which produced figures for this report. On the basis of that data, the report concluded that an estimated 1,800 to 3,600 children are injured each year as a result of physical product failure with a higher, but unfortunately unquantifiable, number injured because of unsafe design. Figures for adults injured as a result of physical product failure ranged between 9,500 and 19,000. Even taking the most conservative estimates and trying not to be emotional about the particularly poignant tragedy of children killed and injured in this way, there is clearly a problem to be addressed. So we find ourselves here today with this legislation, legislation about which I will be expressing some reservations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the frustrating difficulties in this whole process in this period of time has been the difficulty in getting comprehensive statistical data. We have relied a great deal on the Australian Consumers Association whose magazine <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Choice</EMPHASIS> identifies an average of 50 unsafe products each year. We should remember that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Choice</EMPHASIS> only tests a minute proportion of the products that are actually available on the market. Again, that is an indication of the need for this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unsafe products continue to be produced, sold and used many years after hazards have been identified and in spite of government moves from time to time against such products. Unless moves are made by government specific to manufacturers' products, manufacturers continue to produce them, even though very often there are known faults in those products. Manufacturers are always reluctant to announce recalls and they are not always efficiently conducted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are getting legislation now because it is realised that obviously there are deficiencies in the present law, and the present law has failed to meet the needs of consumers. The Australian Consumers Association has been of assistance in looking at some of those inadequacies. An analysis of the Trade Practices Commission's survey done by the Australian Consumers Association indicated that for people surveyed the cost of taking legal proceedings was a strong deterrent to pursuing a claim for compensation. The varied rights of compensation meant that proceedings were less likely to be pursued where the injured person had neither bought nor owned the product&mdash;the innocent third party issue. The length of time and the stress involved in legal proceedings often deterred people from taking action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this debate I do not want to ignore previous reforms made to the law here in Australia. Quite clearly, we have reached the stage where it is agreed that the inadequacies need to be met. Perhaps the debate now is about the extent to which the inadequacies of the present law are being met by this legislation. Therefore, it is probably worth looking at the evolution from those earlier dates that I have mentioned to the legislation that is now before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to mention the joint Australian Law Reform Commission and Victorian Law Reform Commission reports of 1989 and the Industry Commission assessment of those reports in 1990 as part of that evolutionary process. As Senator Hill has mentioned, legislation was then proposed by Senator Tate in his capacity as the Minister. In May 1991, as a consequence of his announcements at that point, the Minister was congratulated by consumer groups and by the Democrats for the announcement that under new laws the onus of proving whether or not a product was defective would be on the manufacturer of the product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I am going to speak about the evolution of this legislation from the ideal&mdash;in our view, anyway&mdash;presented by the Law Reform Commission's report, we have to mention, as the first of the blows, the reversal by Minister Tate of that commitment of May 1991. We wish to make a complaint about the feeling of the consumer movement that there was a lack of consultation in that process; we acknowledge the pressure of business and industry groups leading to that decision. If congratulations were to be forthcoming for the change of that decision, they would have to go to the then shadow Minister for consumer affairs, Peter Costello, who at that point congratulated the Minister on his position. The effect of that back down will be devastating to many consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that we can say that the onus of proof is now in the wrong place. The model that is being used is the lowest common denominator that can be found in the area of product liability. I would have thought&mdash;and I have argued at other times in other places&mdash;that a manufacturer would want, for all good business and economic reasons, to be seen to be standing behind the product that is produced by that manufacturer. It is an enormous deficiency of the legislation that the onus of proof remains with the consumer as a result of this legislation. That was the first step backwards in the evolution of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were then treated to quite a public exercise of pressure on the Government generally and, of course, on the responsible Minister at the time, Senator Tate, particularly as we came into 1992. It concluded with the situation which we now have where not only has the onus of proof been placed in the wrong place but also key and controversial elements of the Bill have been taken out of the legislation and sent off to a committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Minister's press release on 7 May announcing that move, following the Caucus committee's decision, the Minister was, I think, as honest as we will ever see a parliamentarian, and particularly a Minister, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And on the three issues opposed by business, I will have my day in court&mdash;or rather in committee&mdash;to argue for their inclusion.</PARA>
<PARA>There are two bits of commendable honesty there: firstly, making it quite clear why these provisions are taken out&mdash;because business does not want them in there; and, secondly, telling his Government and his Caucus, quite bravely, that he is going to continue to argue for them. More power to his arm. I just note here that that Minister will not be the Minister in the Committee, but as a senator, of course, he is quite free to go along to the Committee and have his day in court, and I hope he does. I will probably be there, even though I am no longer on the inestimable Senator Cooney's Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, on which I served for a number of years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look forward to seeing Senator Tate argue for those controversial elements. I will outline them. There is the extraterritoriality element, giving overseas consumers the right to sue Australian manufacturers over defective products; there is the period of repose, which Senator Tate had proposed to be 20 years after manufacture; and there are the Aussie battler provisions, designed to ensure that where in all the circumstances of the case the consumer's claim is reasonable the consumer should be guaranteed his or her day in court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are now in the hands of a new Minister. Senator Tate, I believe, is still the representing Minister in this chamber. I am sure that he will play a key role, but I am equally confident that Minister McHugh will argue for these provisions if her public record on matters such as this is anything to go by, and I am sure it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think this is the end of the matter&mdash;at least I hope it is not. As I say, I have had some experience on the Committee to which these issues have been referred. Its record shows a committee that has deliberated in the interests of the public in general. It is a committee which I believe will do useful work in this area. But I feel that this Bill needs to be put forward in the name of Mr Peter Costello, the former shadow Minister in the other place, rather than in any Government Minister's name because I guess he is the one to whom the victory has gone. Incidentally, I wonder where Senator Aulich is in this debate. I felt sure we would hear him in the chamber, as he has clearly been a front runner in putting aside many of the interests of consumers in this country and watering down a piece of legislation which, as I said, is tremendously important to consumers and, I think, to the reputation of business and industry. I do not think it enhances the reputation of business and industry in this country that they have not been prepared to stand behind their products, products which they freely release in the community, with a number of constraints, of course, under other relevant legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is obvious from the very few figures I have cited&mdash;there are many more; this is a difficult time of the year and one cannot go into enormous depth and detail&mdash;that market forces do not protect consumers. They particularly do not protect children or those innocent third parties who too often are injured or killed by defective products. Our reputation internationally is not enhanced by the back down, particularly on the extraterritoriality question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, we are not opposing this legislation. We are forced to see it as a step in the right direction&mdash;but merely that. I have a specific question for the Minister which I will put on the record now. He may wish to take time to answer it&mdash;we can possibly do it in the committee stage. Because legislation tends eventually to run very quickly through the chamber in these last two or three weeks, there has not been time for the Minister to answer a question which was posed by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee&mdash;another committee chaired by the inestimable Senator Cooney and on which I happened to serve for a second time during my time in this Parliament. It is a question that relates to clause 4, the proposed new section 75AH, which proposes to insert a new part 5A into the Trade Practices Act dealing with the survival of liability actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Scrutiny of Bills Committee is concerned. I refer to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Alert Digest</EMPHASIS> to be tabled today&mdash;I hope I am not breaching privilege of the Senate. I will not quote it; I will just paraphrase the concern. Since the Trade Practices Act contains no similar provision in relation to the survival of liability in relation to other actions under the Act, the question is whether the insertion of this specific provision under this section of the Act dealing with product liability is likely to call into question survivability on actions in other sections of the legislation, for instance, under section 52A, misleading and deceptive conduct. There is a concern that, having been specific about survivability in this area, interpretation may well be made&mdash;particularly, I would imagine, by someone against whom an action is being taken under other sections of the Act; they may well be looking for such an interpretation from a smart QC somewhere&mdash;that survivability only exists under this legislation if it is specified, as it is in this section, the product liability section. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like the Minister to look at this. In the normal course of events I am sure the Committee would have been supplied with a response from the Minister in due course, but it is something which concerns me and it did obviously concern the Committee. We would not want to see the Trade Practices Act affected in any negative way by the insertion of a new section on product liability, which, of course, we strongly support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Senator Hill's contribution, when he talked about the evolution that has led to this legislation he mentioned that we had finally reached a Bill which was `acceptable to the Opposition'. I have already made that point. But I remind the Government and the listening public&mdash;all 250 of them, if there are that many listening today&mdash;and place on record that the Government did not need the Opposition's support for this legislation. A lot is said about the Democrats' role in holding the balance of power in the Senate. There is a lot of misinterpretation, misinformation and even malicious misinformation about that situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make it quite clear that in this case the Government did not need to water down the legislation in order to have it pass the Parliament. The Democrats supported strong legislation. They were much happier with Minister Tate's initial position and legislation and would have expedited its passage through the Senate. What the Government believed it needed, and certainly wanted, was the approval, the pat on the head, from business and industry in this country, who have cried foul quite unjustifiably. They are not prepared to stand by their products&mdash;watering down a piece of vital legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government has not been prepared to stand up against the business lobby. That does not surprise us. The Labor governments of Prime Minister Hawke and now Prime Minister Keating have demonstrated time and again that almost their top priority in government is to be on the right side of their business mates. This week we have seen it again with pay TV and airline sales. This product liability law is just another example. It will not be lost on the electorate in the coming Federal election. This Government has definitely shown a lack of intestinal fortitude when it comes to standing up for the rights of ordinary Australians against the heavy business and industry lobby in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I emphasise that we could have had stronger legislation. The numbers were there for it within the Parliament and, I believe, outside in the community, given the figures I quoted earlier of numbers of children and adults killed and injured by defective products over the years, numbers that we really cannot quantify. I think the Government stands condemned for its approach and its cave-in on this one. Of course, this is not the first time the Labor Party in government has done the Liberal Party's work for it with privatisation, deregulation, corporatisation and cave-in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is not with a great deal of pleasure that I support this legislation. It is an advance. A great deal has been put into the hands of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, and the Democrats will continue to pursue this question. No government, whether this or a future one, will be allowed to ignore a report that might come from that Committee urging a stronger stance, as I am confident it will, or the voice of consumers out in the community. We should not forget that, while business and industry might be the squeaky wheel, and on this occasion it has got the oil, consumers have the numbers. The Democrats will support this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;By agreement, speakers on this side of the House are limiting the contributions they make in order that we may get through our legislative timetable, so I am speaking on this matter for a shorter time than I would normally do. If I may say right at the outset, this is an issue I have followed since the original proposition surfaced out of one of the consumer groups Senator Powell mentioned. I think we have to put on the record that it is misinformation to say that it is industry which calls the tune&mdash;or that it is the squeaky wheel, as Senator Powell called it. In fact, the consumer groups, funded very largely by government and taxpayers' money, have had a disproportionate say in the development of this initiative in particular and, indeed, others that come before the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the history of this legislation we see that it began as a piece of draconian legislation where there was to be no defence whatsoever. If anyone was injured by any product, then strict liability was the result and damages flowed. The only plea one could enter was one of mitigation as to the size of the damages. That issue was discussed early on and did not come to us in the form of a Bill. Many people pre-empted the wisdom of adopting that course and pointed to the sorts of things that have happened in the United States, where they have developed their product liability `remedies' through their common law system as distinct from a legislative framework. Quite frankly, it has resulted in whole industries being put out of business. The most obvious example is small aircraft, which are simply no longer manufactured. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The social philosophy behind this legislation was that, somehow, one had to make manufacturers wear the cost of whatever damage might result from any manufactured good. That is a piece of socialist nonsense and was finally rejected, but not until we had much debate. An economic impact statement was made on the original proposals which really torpedoed them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have gone through several stages of drafting of the legislation before us. I would particularly like to congratulate the shadow Attorney-General, Mr Peter Costello, for the work he has done in negotiating and in pointing out the damaging results to the economy had the onus of proof been shifted, as was proposed by the original draft section 75AL, together with other provisions imposing new liability on manufacturers for imports. Mr Costello has done a first class job in bringing about changes to the Bill. As my colleague Senator Hill has said, the Opposition will not be opposing the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There are, however, a couple of other points I want to put on the record. I particularly want to draw comparison with the directive of the European Commission as it has been enacted by some, but not all, European Community members. Basically, the standard that has been adopted is the German standard. Indeed, the British Parliament passed legislation pursuant to the Commission's directive. The Commission held that the British legislation did not match up to the directive as it meant it to be fulfilled. It threatened the British Parliament by saying, `Either you change your legislation or we will take it to the European Court of Justice'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite interestingly, there is not a political federation in the European Community; it has imposed upon itself a legal federation, the consequences of which it is still working through in terms of sovereignty and how it is going to establish a political framework. Here we say that we are matching the European standard, which is really the German interpretation of that standard. When I had discussions in Germany with some of its legislators, I asked how the legislation was operating, and they said that they could afford it. That was before their economy started to suffer something of a recession after the unification of East and West Germany. We will have to see what the future of that legislation is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the Bill before us, we see that in some important respects the breadth of the current proposed law goes beyond the European standard and will impose stricter obligations on Australian producers than are imposed on their European counterparts. To this extent the Government cannot properly make the claim, as the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) has done in the second reading speech, that the introduction of a regime consistent with the directive will ensure that no undue impediments to trade are imposed. The words of an article written at the end of last year by Dr Ellen Beerworth of Mallesons Stephen Jaques go to the underlying philosophy of the Bill. She said, very simply, that the Bill will cost local companies millions of dollars and create damaging uncertainties for companies trying to protect their legal positions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that I have a problem with the concept of strict liability in the way it is being imposed. The contractual liabilities, the provisions of the Trade Practices Act as they presently exist and, of course, the tortious remedy of negligence I still think are good remedies for matters concerning damage to individuals caused by products that are faulty. To conclude my contribution I quote Dr Beerworth because I think her remarks are good:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reforms . . . are inevitable because we are now conditioned by the very long period of public debate in this country, and by the very successful lobbying of the consumer protectionists, to believe that substantial reforms are necessary.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, referring to Senator Powell's remarks, we have to realise that in an economy such as ours we depend for our standard of living on the production of goods and services and the creation of wealth in which we may all then share. In this sort of legislation, which is brought about by pressure groups, lobby groups, who have their own power base largely funded by the taxpayer, we are starting to see an uneven balance. Nonetheless, I again congratulate Mr Costello for the fine negotiating work he did so that we have finally received a Bill which the Opposition will not oppose. </PARA>

I will quickly go through them. The first issue is whether there ought to be a period of repose in respect of any injuries that arise from the use of a defective implement and, if so, what that period should be.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I thank those senators who joined in the debate on the Trade Practices Amendment Bill. This very important Bill will change the regime of product liability so far as manufacturers in Australia are concerned. It is in fact a very significant advance. The law which evolved out of the marketplace, the common law of England, provided for the costs of damage to property or injury to a person to be shifted from that unfortunate injured party to the manufacturer. This law, which is expressed in terms of contract law and tort law of negligence, modified by a statute here or a statute there, will now be supplemented in Australia by a law which will make it very clear that if a manufacturer puts a defective product into the marketplace and that defective product causes an injury, the manufacturer will have to pay compensation to that person who has suffered bodily injury or some damage to property.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very reasonable proposition. I think it was necessary to depart from some of the earlier suggestions that emerged from law reform commissions and so on which had foreshadowed an attempt to bring about a regime where, simply, the fact that injury related to a product would be enough to require the manufacturer to pay compensation. We say, `No, it ought to be a defective product; it ought to be a product which does not meet the standards of safety which the community generally is entitled to expect'. It seems to me to be reasonable to say that a manufacturer should bear liability only in that situation. But if that situation does arise and the product does not meet the standard of safety which the community generally is entitled to expect and an injury occurs, then putting that product into the marketplace is an act which should bear financial consequences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I say that this is a reasonable proposition, I contrast it with the US situation, to which Senator Bishop quite rightly pointed. The product liability regime there is coupled with a regime which is highly favourable to plaintiffs. There are contingency fees and jury awards of damages, including punitive damages. There is a rule as to costs whereby a person can take a manufacturer defendant to court. That manufacturer defendant might be faced with, let us say, $2m in costs and successfully defend the claim but then have to pay the costs anyway. So the regime in the United States is one which we certainly would not wish to follow. It has had a disastrous impact on sectors of the manufacturing industry in the United States. Therefore, where do we look?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The European Community, which is a major manufacturing power and a major trading area of the world community, has certainly put forward a directive which has the sorts of elements we were looking for. Other areas, such as northern Asia&mdash;Japan, Taiwan and South Korea&mdash;are also showing an interest in taking up the European directive as the model for their laws relating to product liability. So we have taken that particular model and adapted it to Australian conditions. This is what has been put into the Bill now before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These measures will be salutary for Australian manufacturers. On the one hand, when they export, for example, into the European Community or into northern Asian markets which will adopt this regime, they will know from their Australian experience the sort of standard which they might be required to reach. On the other hand, if they are engaged in world competitive manufacturing and therefore exporting into various markets, it seems to me that Australian consumers should have exactly the same rights in respect of compensation for any damage to property or bodily injury as would be the case for consumers in the countries to which exports go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The adoption of the European directive is a very sensible move. I am quite confident that it will lead to a situation where Australian manufacturers, rather than actually paying out great amounts of money to their insurers for claims brought under this Bill, will look to their design processes, their quality control processes and their whole manufacturing process. They will look to the way in which they put goods into the marketplace&mdash;the information and warnings that accompany such goods. They will upgrade their operation in a way which will not only reduce their insurance premiums but also bring them into conformity with the expectations underlying Parliament's passing of this legislation so that goods are not put into the marketplace which deviate from the standard of safety which the community generally is entitled to expect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For all the reasons that have been put forward, I believe that the Bill deserves the support of the Senate. I understand Senator Powell's concern that certain matters have been deleted from the Bill, but they do not affect the substance of the reform which is being undertaken. I also believe that the courts will have regard to the jurisprudence which will emerge in the European Community, particularly from those English courts which adopt a more robust approach to the principle of res ipsa loquitur, namely, that the thing speaks for itself; that an inference can be drawn from the way in which a particular accident has occurred. If the Australian courts have a more sympathetic attitude to that principle&mdash;which, as I say, is adopted in the negligence law of the English courts in a more robust way than here in Australia&mdash;then we will make a significant advance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That matter and others are to be considered by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs&mdash;this was alluded to by the eminent Chairman of the Committee, Senator Cooney, in his contribution to the debate this morning&mdash;so that we might have a full discussion in the public arena. Manufacturers and consumer lobby groups can put forward their point of view in a way which is not hidden&mdash;not by way of the sort of lobbying which can occur around the corridors&mdash;but open and on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record so that it can be properly assessed by the senators on that Committee. I am sure that they will do their job in a non-partisan way in order to ensure that we have the best regime possible for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That has been a consideration. Whilst I do not anticipate that in the near future the Opposition would accede to government at the Federal level here in Australia, I think it is extremely important for the manufacturing sector and for insurance purposes in Australia that there be a confidence that whatever legislation is put in place to do with product liability will survive for a considerable time. It would not be a good thing for the manufacturing sector in Australia, which is as such an employer of Australians, to have uncertainty about possible amendment in the future and be without, as I say, strong bipartisan support. I believe that that is why the Senate committee process is a useful way in trying to gather that sort of support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this particular legislation will advance very considerably the rights of those Australians who suffer bodily injury or some loss in relation to their property occasioned by a product being put into the marketplace which does not meet the standard of safety which persons generally are entitled to expect. If a manufacturer does not design the product correctly, does not have adequate quality control processes during the manufacturing stage and does not accompany the product with sufficient and adequate information and warnings as it goes into the marketplace to be purchased, a manufacturer will have to bear the costs of such injury as is occasioned by that defective product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That seems to me to be a very sensible principle. It strips away many of the hurdles, difficulties and impediments raised by the common law which have disabled otherwise worthy claimants from pursuing properly through the legal process claims for compensation. This will advance their interests in a way which I believe is very important. I therefore commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) may have been advised that we have one concern that has just been brought to our attention concerning the extraterritorial effect. It is a matter that was raised by Clayton Utz, Solicitors and Attorneys, by letter to the Minister dated 2 June. I understand that the solicitors have now received oral advice from senior counsel which confirms the basis of its concern. Its letter to the Minister&mdash;unfortunately I have not had a copy of that letter until just now&mdash;reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Second Reading Speech circulated in company with the Trade Practices Amendment Bill 1992, you stated that three provisions, including the provision under which overseas consumers were given the right to sue Australian manufacturers of defective products had been removed from the Bill. You foreshadowed that these amendments could be examined by a Senate Committee.</PARA>
<PARA>We have been dealing with that issue today. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst the amendment proposed for s5(1) of the Trade Practices Act has been deleted from the Bill, the Schedule to the Bill contains an amendment to s6(2)(c), the effect of which is to give overseas consumers the right to sue Australian manufacturers of defective products. In order to give effect to the Government's announced intention that the extra-territorial provisions can be considered by the Senate Committee, this amendment should also be deleted from the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 6(2)(c) in the schedule simply provides that after `that Part' insert `or in Part VA'. Whilst the Minister was closing the debate on the second reading, I hope he did not mind us having a brief discussion with his advisers. I understand that the legal opinion of the Crown is that it is a complex matter and somewhat ambiguous. In those circumstances, unless the Minister is very persuasive in his reply to these comments, I suggest that the safest course of action is that that part of the schedule also be removed and given to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for consideration. I am not sure whether there would be any other inadvertent consequence from that removal; the Minister might address that. Alternatively, he might consider that this particular issue should be adjourned until later in the day rather than take up time of the chamber at the moment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition supports the National Crime Authority Amendment Bill 1992. However, I wish to make a few remarks in respect of this Bill. The second reading speech by the then Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senate Tate) basically seeks to indicate that the Authority is faced with a sudden problem in that if two of the existing members do not have their appointments extended for a further year, the work they are currently doing on certain references will suffer&mdash;and that, presumably, will undoubtedly be the case&mdash;and that the Authority will not have the consistency of membership that it really does require to operate effectively.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lack of consistency in membership of the Authority is a matter that the current Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority has drawn attention to, as the Minister rightly points out. That was done in the Committee's recent report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Who is to Guard the Guards?</EMPHASIS>. I raise the matter now to indicate that that report is not the first time this matter has been raised; it was the last time it has been raised. It has been raised by nearly every composition of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority since it was originally formed. As I am informed by past members of the Committee, the lack of continuity in membership has been an ongoing problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we are in early June, knowing that the membership of two particular members of the Authority expires on 30 June this year, and that if this Bill is not passed then the Authority's membership will suffer this lack of continuity. Suddenly we have this Bill brought in to accommodate that problem to allow both of those members to be reappointed. It is worth noting perhaps that neither the Chairman nor any of the members can have their appointments extended past a four-year total. Nonetheless, these two particular members who were appointed for three years can now be reappointed for a further year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an old problem. The Government has known since the commencement of the appointment of these two members that their membership would expire in June of this year. It is not as though it suddenly discovered that a few weeks ago; it is something that was known from the very beginning of their appointments. There have been other changes in the Authority that have made the retirement of two of its members a more difficult proposition. The former chairman of the Authority, Mr Justice Phillips, resigned on 17 December last year. That is not when he announced his retirement but that is when it took effect. The new chairman, Mr Thomas Sherman, took up his position on 26 February. Although there is another member&mdash;Mr Malcolm Gray, who is based in Adelaide&mdash;Mr Sherman and Mr Gray between them do not have a very extensive experience of Authority matters or of what has been happening over the last three years within the Authority. That might be a very good argument for extending the terms of Mr Cusack and Mr Leckie, but it does not address the problem of which we have known for a long time. There must be some other way by which the Government could have got around the problem of continuity of membership of the Authority: for example, by appointing someone else or by having people working for the Authority who knew that they were going to take up positions when Mr Leckie and Mr Cusack retired. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is probably no other way out at this stage, but I am seeking to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that the problem has been recognised for a long time. This Bill is not the only possible resolution of the matter&mdash;or would not have been had attention been given to it earlier&mdash;but it is probably the only possible resolution now simply because the Government has left it until now. There were other ways in which to organise better continuity within the Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An additional point is that all the Bill does is postpone the problem. It may well be true&mdash;although I doubt it&mdash;that, after a further year of appointment for Mr Cusack and Mr Leckie, Mr Sherman and Mr Gray will have gained more extensive experience of Authority operations. That would be a good thing and would provide for greater continuity. Nonetheless, there would still be the problem of one half of the membership leaving next year rather than this year. That leaves the problem of continuity in not having planned to stagger the departure of these two gentlemen by reappointing, for example, one and not the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last but not least, it is a matter of regret that we find ourselves in this situation when there is a Standing Committee of Privileges inquiry under way, the outcome of which may have some impact on either gentleman. This chamber is being asked to endorse&mdash;and we are in fact endorsing&mdash;the appointments without knowing the outcome of that inquiry. That is also a matter of regret. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition supports the Bill, but I underline my view, as the Deputy Chairman of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, that the Government could and should have given attention to providing better continuity of membership in other ways. I will be interested to see whether there is some explanation by the Government as to whether it did think of other ways and, if so, why they were discarded and why we now find ourselves a few weeks before the terms of the two gentlemen expire being asked to extend their membership of the Authority. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the National Crime Authority Amendment Bill 1992 is to amend section 37 to allow for the reappointment of two of the current members of the Authority while keeping their terms within the overall limit of four years as provided by statute. I agree with the comment made by Senator Vanstone, that the Government has placed itself in a somewhat embarrassing position in having to do that with a great deal of haste. While it is certainly true that the action the Government is now taking is in response, or could be said to be in response, to a recommendation made by the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority in its report titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Who is to Guard the Guards?</EMPHASIS>, the matter has been raised on numerous occasions before and it was very apparent that the problem would arise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment it has arisen because the three-year terms of both Mr Cusack, QC, and Mr Leckie, expire on 30 June 1992. Both members are heavily involved in current references. Mr Sherman has only recently been appointed as Chairman. Although Mr Gray, QC, has been a member for almost 12 months, he has necessarily been confined to a limited aspect of the Authority's operation. For these reasons, as well as Mr Justice Phillips's unexpected resignation, the Authority would lack members with any significant tenure and experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This measure has been given some additional urgency by the difficulties that were experienced in the hand-over of the chairmanship of the National Crime Authority from Mr Justice Stewart to Mr Faris, which gave rise to the so-called Ark report episode where we finished up with two versions of the same report, one purportedly authorised by the previous Chairman and the other authorised by the new Chairman. It is clear that such embarrassing, inefficient and certainly undesirable situations must be avoided. While we would have liked to get the Government to act a lot sooner on this matter, the Australian Democrats do not raise any objection to this Bill and will support it, for the reasons outlined. </PARA>

They are Mr Cusack and Mr Leckie. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I seem to remember having voted against the National Crime Authority Bill when it was first introduced very many years ago because I thought it was debasing the federalist approach to law enforcement agencies and I believed that there were other appropriate mechanisms for the gathering of information on law enforcement in Australia. However, having said that, I have been as enthusiastic as anybody to ensure that it succeeds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Authority's history has been a very sorry one almost from day one. Perhaps from the very beginning the problem was that there was competition between the Government and the Opposition as to who could introduce the most draconian legislation, because law and order was an issue. When that took place, there was almost an obligation upon the Chairman of the NCA to get some scalps straightaway to justify the NCA being set up. Initially there seemed to be a pursuit of short term objectives so that the existence of the creature could be justified both by the Authority and by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we have lurched out of that circumstance, all sorts of other crises have occurred along the way&mdash;whether they have been with the Chairman or with the members; whether they have been with internal dissatisfaction, lack of morale, lack of success, lack of direction, lack of purpose, lack of understanding of the objectives; whether they have been with duplication of other law enforcement authorities. The whole range of matters has in many respects been the cause of the abysmal failure of the NCA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That all changed in many respects with the appointment of Mr Justice Phillips to the Chairman's position. I hope that the good work that he undertook will be built on by the present Chairman; but the fact that now, because of current legislation, the very operations of the NCA will be in some peril if this legislation is not passed, is simply a further reflection of the problems of the NCA. I hope from this point on that the operations of the NCA will become more predictable, the quality of the members will be of the standard to ensure that it will be an effective operation and, in due course, the timing of their appointments and their retirement will not in any way inhibit the functioning of the NCA. I hope that simple matters such as that can be put in place to ensure its effective operation. To the extent that the legislation does what it does, I support the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a bit of a hybrid, but it was designed to overcome many of the territorial inhibitions on effective law enforcement work in Australia where organised criminal activity had no regard to State boundaries. It was necessary that law enforcement agencies should be able to operate across State boundaries. In its core legislation, the National Crime Authority is designed precisely to provide a mechanism which enables jurisdictions to cooperate in giving references to the Authority so that it can pursue organised criminal activity wherever it might occur within Australia. When we were establishing the National Crime Authority, it was also extremely important to note some overseas experience. In particular, I recall when I chaired the Senate Committee which came up with the final draft of a National Crime Authority-type approach&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right; they were good days. The honourable senator may have been a member. Honourable senators will recall that we had many discussions about the influence&mdash;I will not put an adjective in front of it&mdash;of J. Edgar Hoover on the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the lesson that might be learned from allowing a person to exercise such extraordinary power of investigation for a long period  within a democracy. It was therefore determined that the tenure of office of the members of the Authority should really be only three years&mdash;I think three years was decided upon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps that is a little short, but we were very conscious of the need to guard against the concentration of intelligence gathering and memory, and therefore the capacity to know a tremendous amount over perhaps decades or generations of people's activity within a democracy, if the position were to be held by one person, vested with extraordinary powers. At the time the National Crime Authority was established, it was endowed with powers which were not available to any other police force or law enforcement agency in Australia. This was particularly so, so far as taking evidence without regard to the usual rules relating to the protection privilege against self-incrimination was concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So that was the reason for the imposition of what now perhaps looks to be an arbitrary and certainly is a short term of office for the members of the Authority. It has created some problems in flexibility when there is a coincidence in the ending of the terms of office of several members of the National Crime Authority. The fact that the terms of office of Mr Cusack, QC and Mr Leckie conclude on the same day would not really have raised a problem if Mr Justice Phillips had continued as Chairman of the Authority; he would have given the experience and continuity that was required. But, of course, we know that he has been appointed Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Tom Sherman has been Chairman of the Authority for three or four months only, and while Mr Grey is over in Adelaide, I think, working on a particular reference, and certainly has more restricted experience in dealing with references by the National Crime Authority, it is thought to be prudent to guard against the loss of that experience and expertise and to seek the Parliament's concurrence, therefore, in providing for the sort of provision which would allow Mr Cusack, QC, and Mr Leckie to continue for a year. Therefore, Mr Acting Deputy President, I certainly commend this Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill 1992, which seeks to amend some of the changes made to the funding and disclosure provisions by the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Act 1991. The Opposition will not be opposing this Bill, but I would like to make a few remarks about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill is a technical piece of legislation and its main purpose is to ease the accounting workload for political parties created by the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Act. Honourable senators will remember that one of the major thrusts of that Act was to ban advertising on radio and television of political parties during election campaigns. It was responsible for the longest continuous debate in this chamber since 1964. However, this particular Bill does not touch the broadcast aspects, but simply the disclosure aspects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Act introduced in 1992 introduced greater financial reporting requirements for political parties and third parties. In particular, it required registered political parties to lodge annual returns detailing all income expenditure and debts. In the months since the Act came into operation, it has become obvious that the Government has yet again created an administrative nightmare for political parties and their branches in trying to comply with those reporting requirements. It must be remembered that all branches are made up of volunteers, and the people most likely to be affected are the non-Labor political parties in Australia because their branches are so important to them. They are so unimportant to the Labor Party, which relies almost entirely for its support and the preselection of its candidates on the trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the existing Act, political parties need to record the identity of every person or organisation who pays to, receives from, or is owed money by the party, regardless of how small that sum might be. The data must be collected and collated to determine that the total sum paid to, received by, or owed by the party exceeds the $1,500 limit, which triggers the identification requirements for disclosure. The revised division 5A incorporated in this Bill, which exempts the reporting of sums of less than $100 received by a party during a fundraising event, and the disclosure of sums of less than $100 owed by the parties, will go some way towards easing the administrative burden of complying with the disclosure provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, new section 314AB allows registered political parties 20 weeks instead of the existing eight weeks to lodge their annual returns at the end of the financial year. This is a more realistic timeframe in which to prepare those reports. The Opposition welcomes the provision of new section 314AD, which will protect the privacy of party employees by exempting details of their wages and salaries from the party's reporting requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could not help but note that the Labor Government has made life a little easier for itself and for its trade union benefactors by removing the obligation to detail the names and addresses of executives of registered industrial organisations, that is, trade unions, in their returns to the Electoral Commission. However, I do understand that, from a practical point of view, it is a requirement that the Electoral Commissioner has really never had to call on, and for that reason we will not be opposing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, despite the amendments in the Bill, the Government's funding and disclosure legislation still remains flawed and inadequate. On the one hand, the reporting requirements are so onerous that they will deter honest people from donating to a political party, while, on the other hand, there are such large gaps in some of the disclosure laws that it is possible to drive the proverbial truck through them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government pays plenty of lip-service to the notion of full accountability of political funding and expenditure, but its laws are neither fair nor equitable. This was canvassed in December 1991 on the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill. As was pointed out at that time, the coalition, the Liberal and National parties, support full, fair and equitable disclosure of political donations. To achieve this, we believe that disclosure laws must ensure that a level playing field exists between the parties, including in regard to taxation, so that no party enjoys a tax advantage over the others. There should be severe penalties if any donor to a political party is singled out for punitive action as a result of making that donation, and donations should be voluntary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Government has turned a blind eye to these issues, which are essential for fair and just funding and disclosure laws. There is no level playing field between the parties. When I say `the parties', I mean the Labor Party as against any other political party in this country, whether it be the Liberal Party, the National Party, the Democrats or any other group. It enjoys that unfair financial advantage because of its special relationship with the trade unions. As everybody is aware, there are two arms to the Labor Party. One is the industrial arm, which is the trade union movement, and the other is the political arm, which is the ALP in government or in Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ALP benefits greatly from the current regime, under which its main benefactor, the trade union movement, can make tax free donations to the party. It is not generally recognised in the community that all income received by trade unions is tax free money. A trade union would pay no tax if it owned, for example, the Gold Coast casino or a part of it. If a trade union sells a major building which it owns in the central business district of any capital city, it does not pay capital gains tax. In my State of Queensland, unions are absolved from paying land tax. Yet the trade union movement is a major organisation in Australia with major investments and it is given a privileged status. Again, in my home State of Queensland the ALP headquarters are located in the Trades and Labor Council building at West End. Not only does that show the ownership of the Australian Labor Party by the trade union movement, but it also shows the special tax benefits that accrue to the Labor Party by that association. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators opposite point out that the income tax exemption also applies to other professional and trade organisations. But these associations, unlike the trade unions, are not affiliated with any political party, nor do they act as a conduit for funds to a political party. Simply in affiliation fees, my calculation&mdash;and I mentioned this figure last time&mdash;indicates that the ALP picks up, around Australia every year, an amount of about $5m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition believes that funding and disclosure provisions must ensure that donations to parties are voluntary. No such safeguard exists at present. In fact, the Labor Party profits handsomely from the de facto compulsory donations of ordinary workers when people are forced to be members of a union or not have a job, as is the case in every closed shop throughout Australia. It occurs across the board in the mining industry, for example; it occurs across the board in the major building industry&mdash;I am not talking about the home ownership building industry; it occurs across the board in such places as the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The worker's union dues are tax deductible to him, and I do not object to that. But then that tax deductibility is passed on to the ALP by way of affiliation fees, which vary from place to place, I understand, but are $2.10 or thereabouts per head. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would also be interesting to know why that affiliation does occur. The close relationship between the two is well recognised. We saw this not so long ago in Queensland, when the Premier of Queensland, Mr Wayne Goss, attended a function organised by only a handful&mdash;one handful&mdash;of people from the Federated Clerks Union, which agreed to affiliate with the ALP. This is in the Cooke report, which Senator Kernot, by her smile, has read. The question was asked, `Why did you affiliate?', the cost being about $30,000. The answer given was, `Well, we did not actually go and get all the unionists' approval to do this, but we affiliated because it gave us ready access to Ministers and an ability to influence government policy'. If that is not the puppeteer working on the puppets, what is? It makes a joke of claims made by people on the other side as to the sorts of controls that may be exercised on our side of politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is tantamount to a compulsory donation, regardless of whether the employee supports the ALP. It is very interesting to look at the figures. Of those people who are members of the trade union movement, some 40 to 45 per cent vote for the Liberal Party. Yet, against their wishes, they are being compelled to support a political party of which they do not approve. If the trade union movement wants to make donations to the ALP and play politics, as the ACTU is planning to do, that must be disclosed. This raises another interesting point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have read just recently that the ACTU is planning to spend some $10m in a campaign against the coalition to oppose the Fightback package, doing so with basically a tax free status. I am simply making the point that groups that support the other political parties in Australia do not have the luxury of being able to claim tax deductibility. I must say, however, that in the amendments to the Bill last year minor amounts were allowed, which would be of some benefit to the other parties. That is a step in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another important condition of the full, fair and equitable disclosure is that donors must be protected against coercion and intimidation. Every time I have raised this, people have said to me, `It does not really exist. You are making it up'. Anyone with any experience of the world out there knows the nonsense involved in that. I might also say that to some degree it is a human reaction. It is not necessarily an evil reaction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can tell a story against myself right here and now. About a year ago I saw a list of donors to the Australian Labor Party. One of the people on the top of that list, who had made a major donation, was someone I knew very well. Because it was disclosed, two things went through my mind. Firstly, I thought, `I can never have a decent conversation with that person again'. That is a human reaction. Secondly, I thought, `Why did he pay that money and what is he going to get out of it?'. That is the sort of thing that happens. People who normally donate to non-Labor parties will say outright, `The reason we do not want it disclosed is that we do not want to be intimidated by a militant trade union or by a hostile government'. Again I say this in a non-political way because it occurs across the board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem of disclosure and intimidation is very real. I hope that, with the tightened up penalties that we put in the Bill in 1991, sooner or later someone will be picked up for that. It will enable people to feel more confident about donating to a political party simply because they can believe in the direction that is being taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give a little example. I am not in the business of fundraising. That is not our job. I do not think I am good at it, either. I do not like asking people for money. A businessman told me that if he gave a $20 donation to the Liberal Party, in his honest opinion, the unions would ensure that $200,000 worth of damage was done to his company. That is not a story that I am throwing around here for political purposes; it is a genuine belief held by people in society. We had the example in debate here some time ago of Senator Ray warning Lindsay Fox that, while he had had good industrial relations in the past, he may not expect to have them in the future if it were known that he had given a substantial donation to the Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A little old lady pensioner from far north Queensland sent me through the mail a donation of $10 but she said specifically that she did not want a receipt because she did not want anyone to know she had given it to me in case she was singled out for some sort of discrimination in the small country town from which she came. I just highlight those matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have indicated that we will not be opposing the legislation. Adequate disclosure laws must include severe penalties to protect donors from thuggery. The legislation is not controversial but it is more offensive for what it omits than for what it contains. We will be addressing some of those things in government. Why does the Government not remedy these glaring omissions? The answer is simply that the Labor Party is not really fair dinkum about fairness and equity. It is pragmatic. It will do whatever needs to be done to win an election. The only concern of the Labor Party is to save an endangered animal from extinction. This should appeal to the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a mangy beast which the people of Australia will put down at the next election to rid themselves of the misery the creature has caused. It is a last, desperate attempt to create an unfair advantage for the Labor Party that it hopes will save it from electoral oblivion. If the Keating Labor Government thought it had enough money and popularity to win the next election, it would dump all this legislation and its intended political advertising bans laws tomorrow. </PARA>

That is pretty poor evidence for Senator Short's conclusion that savings have collapsed in this country.

But BHP certainly would not say, and could not say, I believe, that it is concerned about competition internationally. BHP Steel has handled competition internationally very well. Its competitiveness is indicated by the fact that, whereas six or seven years ago it exported very little steel, its steel exports last year were worth $1 billion and will probably be higher this year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is my confident expectation that the Australian Securities Commission would act in a most independent way and in accordance with its normal practice and principles in this regard. As I was outlining in a short form yesterday in answer to questions from Senator Baume and Senator Bishop, companies are required by the corporations law to lodge an annual return with the Australian Securities Commission not later than seven months after the end of the company's financial year. There is a penalty of $500 for failure to lodge an annual return.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised that the usual practice of the Securities Commission is first to issue a warning notice to companies which have failed to lodge a return. If this does not elicit a response, a penalty notice is issued before proceeding to court action against the company's secretary. I understand that failure to lodge within the statutory period is a common occurrence in relation to private companies and that in the 1990-91 financial year there were up to 150,000 companies which failed to lodge an annual return.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also understand that the ASC has not yet issued any warning or penalty notices with respect to those failures but anticipates that it will begin to issue penalty notices at the end of this month. Because of the large number of notices which it will issue, the notices will continue to be issued over the next three to four months. In practice, companies which lodge their annual returns after the due date but before a penalty notice is issued are not subject to any fine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the company Euphron Pty Ltd, in common with other companies which have failed to lodge an annual return for 1990-91, a penalty notice will be issued if an annual return is not lodged in the meantime. As far as the Pleuron company is concerned&mdash;I was asked questions about that also yesterday&mdash;I was asked whether the Prime Minister's family company was required to pay a $500 penalty when it filed its return late on 23 April. The answer to that is no.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 31 March, Senator Alston asked a question about the current estimate of what he described as `effective protection' in relation to a number of items in the tariff schedules&mdash;babies' jumpsuits, Hyundai passenger cars, tennis shoes, et cetera. For the purpose of this answer, I have assumed that he was trying to ask what was the effective rate of assistance. I have provided an answer which sets out the effective rate of assistance and the nominal rate of assistance for those various things. I suspect that the effective rate of assistance is a decreasingly valuable measure of assistance to industries. I seek leave to incorporate the answer in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The answer read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chief forms of protection for these goods are tariffs and quotas. Quotas only apply to goods in the textiles, clothing and footwear industries. Items of a good subject to quota may be imported either within quota, or out of quota. While items imported out of quota attract a lower tariff rate, they also incur a flat levy on each item. The flat levy is generally large compared to the import price, and so the rate of duty payable is much more than on goods imported within quota.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since import prices can vary over a wide range, rates of assistance expressed as a percentage of purchase price can be misleading where imports take place without a quota. Export facilitation and import credit schemes also provide protection to the passenger motor vehicle and textile, clothing and footwear industries, respectively. However, this assistance cannot be allocated to single products. Furthermore, effective rates of assistance (ERAs) are calculated as averages over industries, and do not apply to particular products in multi-product industries. Effective rates of assistance measure the net assistance to an industry's value added. Net assistance includes assistance to output and value adding factors, and the effect of government interventions (eg tariffs, excise taxes and input subsidies) on input costs.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Background</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The clause was inserted in the draft in view of the Commonwealth's concern to avoid manipulation of the system by patients/doctors where patients were admitted for one or two days as private to allow the doctor to treat the patient in a private capacity and raise fee for service.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)repudiates the repeated claims by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade that the exemption provisions of the Freedom of Information Act provide grounds for not producing documents to a House of the Parliament in relation to a matter of great public interest involving the proper conduct of government and the accountability of Ministers to the Parliament;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)calls upon the Minister to respond properly to the questions put to him in the Senate and to produce to the Senate by 12 noon tomorrow, 4 June, all relevant documents to enable the Senate to make a judgment on this matter; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)resolves that the serious issues involved in the Minister's contentions be referred to the Standing Orders Committee for consideration and urgent report back to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Evans has refused on at least five occasions during the last two weeks to supply documents to the Senate on the grounds that he must first assess their confidentiality against FOI criteria&mdash;twice in Senate Question Time of 26 May 1992, once on 27 May, twice two days ago, once yesterday and once again today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have sought legal advice as to whether the Minister is entitled to withhold documents from the Senate subject to FOI criteria. This advice has suggested that there are no grounds for Senator Evans's actions. According to the advice, which I will seek to table in due course, the Freedom of Information Act does not have and does not contain anything which suggests that it has any application to the presentation of documents to the Senate by Ministers, whether in response to orders of the Senate for the production of documents or by ministerial decision in the absence of such orders. Not only this, but the advice from the Clerk of the Senate is that for Senator Evans to continue to evade the Senate's scrutiny under the guise of the Freedom of Information Act would `obviously be a very significant precedent' and that the argument for doing so would be `surprising'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There can be little doubt that Senator Evans, as a silk of sorts, is aware of what is involved in these propositions, which, of course, clearly begs the question of what he has to hide in this matter. We view it as a matter of the utmost seriousness. This Government has had a long history of seeking to restrict access to public information. Perhaps the greatest irony of all is that for many years Senator Evans has been the great champion of the Bill of Rights; someone who, when not grandstanding about constitutional reform and rabbiting on about safeguarding democracy, has sought to build a reputation by espousing civil liberties propositions and, in particular, advancing the cause of freedom of information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One only has to hark back to those days when Senator Evans was constantly springing to the defence of his mentor, the then Senator Murphy, later Mr Justice Murphy, seeking to uphold the supremacy of the Parliament, making a commitment to democratic ideals and, of course, furthering the people's right to know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It therefore has to be a matter of great seriousness that we have in this instance a Minister of the Crown&mdash;a self-proclaimed academic world champion when it comes to an understanding of the law, and someone who is constantly seeking to remind us of how much he knows and what vast knowledge he has of all legal and obtuse propositions relating to civil liberties&mdash;suddenly coming in here and advancing what is clearly an intellectually dishonest proposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is nothing whatever in any history of the Senate or in any academic writings to suggest that Senator Evans has the power to invoke the Freedom of Information Act in the way that he has been seeking to do. Indeed, not only would this be a very significant precedent if it were to get off the ground; it is also little more than an outrageous ambit claim. I suggest that it is utterly hypocritical. Indeed, I am sure that if we gave Senator Evans the chance, he would recite every High Court decision relating to civil liberties and particularly freedom of information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans knows full well that this is an entirely novel and juridically dishonest proposition. It goes to matters of the highest import. Quite clearly, the governance of the nation depends upon people not only having access to the final decision but also in many instances having the power to approach the Parliament and to seek further information. To suggest that somehow the elected representatives of the people can be constrained in the information they might seek by resolution of the Parliament by someone who simply invokes a novel proposition that somehow he is bound by freedom of information constraints or other statutory secrecy propositions is utterly intellectually dishonest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to go back over some of Senator Evans's recent answers to show just how he has been attempting to get this claim off the ground in recent times. On 27 May, he was asked by Senator Hill about a file note of a conversation between the Minister's adviser and a departmental officer. The Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yesterday I offered Senator Hill the opportunity to look at the file note in question on a confidential basis, pending an opportunity for me in turn to evaluate it for its releasability under FOI criteria.</PARA>
<PARA>Putting to one side the nonsense proposition that somehow Senator Hill should have accepted an opportunity to look at a file note on a confidential basis&mdash;lord knows what is meant to follow from that&mdash;would he have been entitled to communicate its contents to anyone or is he struck mute and therefore crippled by having been so silly as to approach the Minister and look at something on a confidential basis?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Putting that proposition aside, on what basis does the Minister claim that it is a matter for him to evaluate a document for its releasability under FOI criteria? If the Minister wants to stand up here, puff out his chest and say, `I am not showing you anything', let him do it. If he is going to say, `I am impressed by FOI criteria; I think that I now ought to follow those in guiding me as to what I release', let him do that. But no-one else has ever done that before. I suggest that if he is about to start doing that, we ought to ask ourselves a very serious question: why is he resorting to this tactic and stratagem at this stage? It is simply a desperate and spurious defence by a desperate Minister to ensure that as little as possible is made available to this Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been very patient for some days in waiting for Senator Evans to finally come forward with a schedule of documents. What he was so gracious as to suggest at the start of Question Time was that he hoped to have this material available tomorrow. What is he really trying to do? We all know what he is trying to do. He is going to try to trot it out late in the afternoon and expect that we will be as slack as he is. He will bring it out at four o'clock. Nothing gets done after four o'clock on the last sitting day. Not only can one not be reading the papers but one certainly cannot be ringing Washington or approaching anyone else. One sits on one's hands, goes to sleep, and gets out of the place as quickly as one can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the strategy is obvious: he is hoping that somehow or other he can stall this so that there is no opportunity for parliamentary debate or scrutiny. That, in itself, I would have thought was unforgivable. But, even if we are graced with this schedule, Senator Evans is setting himself up to be able to say, `Well, here you are; I have excised all the relevant parts because I somehow claim that I am entitled to do this under FOI'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us be perfectly clear: at the end of the day the Minister does not have to give us a thing. And if he chooses not to give us anything or to give us just a little, that is his decision and he will wear it, and be judged accordingly. But do not let him stand up here and pretend that somehow he is entitled to shelter behind statutory provisions&mdash;because he is not. Yet that is the defence he has been trying to mount in recent days. Again, he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was giving him&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Hill&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">an opportunity to take a look at it&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the document&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">before I had had time to look at it for reviewability on FOI grounds. Since yesterday I have had time to review the document on FOI grounds and I am perfectly happy now to table an abbreviated version of that document.</PARA>
<PARA>On 26 May&mdash;here we go again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It may be appropriate to release the documents on FOI or other grounds;</PARA>
<PARA>That is true, particularly if the Minister is considering it in the context of an FOI request. But that has nothing to do with whether he hands over documents sought by members of the Opposition in the Senate. It is simply not open to the Minister to say, `I am considering them on FOI grounds', unless by that he means, `I am going to take it upon myself to impose FOI grounds on what is otherwise clearly unfettered ministerial responsibility'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the Minister should not be so devious as to somehow claim that he is constrained by FOI or other criteria. On 1 June, what we have is this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have already said to the Senate that my Department is presently actively involved in assessing documents by reference to FOI criteria.</PARA>
<PARA>Why should it be? Has the Minister asked them to do it? Has he said to them, `I have decided that nothing that does not meet FOI criteria ought to be released' or is he somehow pretending to them that they have to abide by FOI guidelines? We know that is a nonsense proposition. There is absolutely nothing in the FOI Act that in the slightest bears on the Minister's ability to release documents in this place&mdash;indeed, quite the contrary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliamentary Privileges Act of 1987, I would have thought, makes it crystal clear that he is not constrained in any way whatsoever, and the only possible way in which he might be is if there is an express statutory provision or, by necessary implication, he has to come to the conclusion that the Parliament intended to constrain him in that way. But I defy the Minister to refer us to any such proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 1 June again, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These documents will be in the public domain as soon as my Department has had an opportunity to review it against FOI criteria.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, I make the same comment. On 2 June&mdash;and this is probably the high-water mark&mdash;he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am constrained in what I can say about particular applications because of the secrecy provisions of the Australian Trade Commission Act and the Freedom of Information Act. I have no discretion to release documentation or, for that matter, any detailed information derived from such documentation concerning the business affairs of another person without first giving that person the opportunity to put a case. . .</PARA>
<PARA>On the same day, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am unable to say, consistently with the confidentiality provisions that govern this. Subject to Multiplex itself being prepared to release it, I am not in a position to say who the other members of the group were. But that is something in respect of which I think there is an FOI application,</PARA>
<PARA>Well so what!  I am not sure that the Minister is the appropriate officer to be making the FOI decision. If the responsible officer decides that all those many restraints that operate in that legislation are sufficient to restrict the Minister's ability to make the document available, that is one thing. But that has nothing whatsoever to do with the Minister's power to respond fully to questions or requests or, indeed, demands by way of resolution of this chamber. If he chooses to do nothing, he does nothing but he says so explicitly on that basis. He does not hide behind this fiction that somehow we are now about to create a whole new set of defences which, in a sense, imply that the FOI Act governs the releasability of documents in the chamber&mdash;because it clearly does not. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Freedom of Information Act does not have, and does not contain anything which suggests that it has, any application to the presentation of documents to the Senate by ministers . . . It might be argued that ministers could use the grounds for non-disclosure contained in the Freedom of Information Act as grounds on which they would claim a privilege against the disclosure of documents to a House of the Parliament. I am unaware of any such argument being explicitly advanced by a minister. It would be a most surprising argument, because, as you know, the grounds for non-disclosure under the act are numerous and broad, and it has not hitherto been asserted that they should have any application to the Houses. It would obviously be a very significant precedent for a minister to claim that the grounds contained in the act are grounds for refusing to produce documents to a House of the Parliament, and it would obviously be a highly significant concession if either House in any way conceded such a precedent.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If he chooses to hide behind those provisions, the irresistible conclusion must be that he is doing it because he does not want to disclose to the Parliament that which he has the power to disclose to the Parliament. If that is so, we are entitled on this side&mdash;and, I would have thought, in the wider community&mdash;to assume that this whole teeth dragging exercise is simply going to go on and on, that Senator Evans is going to be dragged screaming into the public domain and that documents which we are entitled to will, one way or another, find their way into the public arena. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Documents should not have to be dragged out in this manner. It is quite specious when there is not a request made subject to FOI&mdash;and even if there is&mdash;to even refer to freedom of information in responding to a request from this chamber. If the Minister wants to advance the proposition that somehow there are fetters on the power of the Parliament, let me remind him of what the Senate itself resolved in 1975. It resolved:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) That the Senate affirms that it possesses the powers and privileges of the House of Commons as conferred by section 49 of the Constitution and has the power to summon persons to answer questions and produce documents, files and papers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) That, subject to the determination of all just and proper claims of privilege which may be made by persons summoned, it is the obligation of all such persons to answer questions and produce documents.</PARA>
<PARA>That matter has been tested quite exhaustively in recent times in relation, again, to efforts by this Government to somehow claim that the National Crime Authority Act of 1984 constrains a parliamentary committee's power to seek documents from the National Crime Authority. The advice that has been given and tabled in this chamber on several occasions makes it clear that there are no such constraints. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, an opinion of the Solicitor-General conceded that a general statutory secrecy provision does not apply to inquiries by the Houses or their committees unless the provision in question is so framed as to have such an application. So the same principle clearly applies here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unless the Minister is able to point to some specific provision that limits the power of the Senate, the power of the Minister, the power of the Government, to provide information requested, then there is no basis on which he can refuse to do that. Indeed, we would ultimately welcome that matter being tested on the floor of the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But to voluntarily offer to disclose certain documents but withhold others because of some gratuitous reference to statutory provisions is not something that even a bush lawyer would seriously advance as a proposition to this chamber.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right, thank you. On about half a dozen occasions I have referred to FOI criteria as being the kind of criteria that I am prepared to apply in determining whether particular documents should be released. And for this issue to be raised now, after so many days of referring in those terms, without seeking clarification as to what I meant and as to whether I was relying explicitly on the terms of the FOI statute, is to be, simply, belated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The speech&mdash;together with the motion that it goes with&mdash;is also premature because it anticipates a response from me over the next day or so and assumes a particular kind of response. It assumes the application by me of certain specific criteria, all of which assumptions are simply without any foundation until you have actually seen what it is that I am proposing to produce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is misguided because the whole intellectual apparatus&mdash;if I can dignify it with that description&mdash;on which Senator Alston erects his case is based, really, on a false premise. He would have clearly established that it was a false premise days ago if he had asked me a direct question as to whether, when referring to the FOI in general terms, as I have on a number of occasions, I really mean to be taken as calling in aid all the explicit provisions and all the specific processes that are associated with the FOI Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not for a moment claim, and I never have claimed, other than by shorthand inference, that the FOI Act is directly, literally, fully applicable to the position of a Minister producing documents in response to a request in the Senate. What I have simply been saying is that there are a number of confidentiality criteria that are appropriately applied in circumstances that I will come to in a moment, in accordance with conventions that I will come to in a moment and proper principles that I will come to in a moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of confidentiality criteria that are properly applied. A number of those criteria are set out in the FOI Act, but the FOI Act does not purport to be any kind of statement, either exhaustive or sharply defined, of what executive privilege properly can be claimed in these sorts of situations. It is a general guide to the kinds of things about which it is reasonable, or in respect of which it is reasonable, for governments to use as guidelines in responding to requests for information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">FOI itself does not impose, except in very specific and limited cases, bars to the disclosure of information. It simply establishes guidelines against which, if a government is so minded, it can refuse to disclose information. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not been asked that. All I have said, and I have said it on a number of occasions, is that I have been requested to supply to the Senate all the documents in the Department's possession relating to Symons and the Marshall Islands affair. I have said that I will do so to the extent that I reasonably can, having regard to proper confidentiality criteria. That is exactly what I propose to do. I was simply using `FOI' as convenient shorthand for proper confidentiality criteria.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are the kinds of criteria that it is appropriate to apply in these cases? I will give some examples. In the first place, there are some instances where there is an explicit statutory prohibition on the disclosure of certain information, certainly without going through a particular defined statutory process. The EMDG Act is one such example. When one is looking at statutory secrecy requirements of that kind, it is always a matter to determine the way in which those statutory secrecy provisions interrelate to the particular language in the FOI Act. As I recall, section 38 of the FOI Act says that in certain instances the FOI Act's access provisions override the secrecy provisions that exist elsewhere. It is a matter of looking at the two bits of statutory language together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in that context that I was referring to both the FOI Act and the EMDG Act. That is one of the things that I have not yet had time to look up. In its application to the EMDG documentation, I have not yet received all the documentation from Austrade, as it turns out, and that is one of the things to which I will have to have regard in the next day or so when working out what it is permissible for me to table in the Parliament. I know the general principle of commercial confidentiality and the disclosure of information specifically supplied under that legislation, but I have to look at the applicability of that principle in relation to each bit of paper on Austrade's files in relation to all these various matters. That is one kind of confidentiality issue about which I do not believe there can be any reasonable dispute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I have an obvious responsibility, which I do not propose to resile from in any way, to protect Australia's international interests where they are in any way put at risk by the disclosure of particular information. Whether such a claim can reasonably be made out is always a matter for close analysis and assessment in each case, but where I believe that such a claim can reasonably be made out I will rely upon that as a ground for non-disclosure. I am giving notice of that now. I do not know whether any particular documents or any data or any part of any of the documents in issue here do properly give rise to that claim. That is another one of the things I obviously have to look at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, I have to have regard to the proper principles governing the conduct of court proceedings and not prejudice the position of any litigant, particularly any criminal defendant in court proceedings. It does not matter whether such court proceedings are applying in this country or elsewhere; it is a matter of proper, reasonable principles being appropriate and applicable to the situation. That obviously will be a relevant consideration in relation to material that I have described in general terms as consular material bearing upon the particular conduct of this court case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, there are questions of personal privacy that can involve entirely personal matters&mdash;family matters and things of that kind&mdash;that crop up in the course of this documentation that do not bear upon any matter of public affairs or legitimate public interest but do involve invasion of the privacy of the individual concerned. It is perfectly appropriate that those sorts of considerations be taken into account. There are also questions of commercial confidentiality that are relevant so far as the commercial affairs of companies, particularly in relation to current matters, are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are the kinds of issues. I do not state them in any exhaustive way; I do not state them in any comprehensive way. I do not state them in anything other than an illustrative way. They are legitimate things to which one can have regard. But these are the sorts of things to which one can have regard as being acknowledged over and over again in the affairs of this nation and in the affairs of the respective Houses of Parliament. There is an excellent discussion of this whole matter in the sixth edition of Odgers, at pages 906 and following, governing among other things an extended saga in which I was personally involved in 1982 in endeavouring to extract some documents from the then Government on matters relating to tax avoidance. I was met there with some very conspicuous obstruction by the government of the day&mdash;or what I regarded as obstruction. Whether I would so regard it now depends on all the circumstances of the case. The point is that everything depends on the particular circumstances of the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the attention of honourable senators to those pages of Odgers to see for themselves the kinds of arguments, the kinds of criteria, that have been argued out in this place in recent memory so far as some honourable senators are concerned. I am sure this particular saga is engraved on Senator Walters's mind; it is certainly engraved on Senator Durack's mind and it is certainly engraved on mine. Do not let us have any nonsense about this. A properly argued case was put on that occasion. I was met with arguments coming from the Government which I did not on that occasion accept. But for those opposite to now be arguing that there is any absolute responsibility&mdash;I am not sure that they are&mdash;on the government of the day to produce documents does not sit very easily with their behaviour on that occasion and I draw that to their close attention. </PARA>

I have not called in aid the FOI Act and said that I am explicitly bound to follow the criteria or the process in the FOI Act. I have used the FOI Act simply as a shorthand way of referring to the kind of confidentiality criteria which are in issue. Until today, Senator Alston has not turned a hair. It is entirely belated for him to raise the issue in this way. If he had concerns about this, it would have been very helpful if he had put them on record much earlier.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will indicate the kind of criteria which have been accepted by Senator Alston's side of politics in the past as appropriate for a government to take into account when confronting some request or purported direction for the tabling of papers. I refer to a passage at page 912 of the sixth edition of Odgers. It is an extract from a statement by a Minister in the Tasmanian House of Assembly. The significance of it in Federal terms is that, speaking in the House of Representatives on 31 October 1967, the then Prime Minister, Mr Holt, stated that he agreed with that Tasmanian statement and said that it might well be adopted as sound policy in the House of Representatives in the Australian Parliament. In relevant part the passage reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Considerations of public policy and a due regard for the interests of the State may require the Minister to withhold information either sought for or ordered to be returned. Were it otherwise, it would be impossible to carry on the Government with safety and honour. To disclose certain information may endanger the interests of the State or of individuals whose conduct or affairs are not in question, and to disclose information given in confidence would be dishonourable and, moreover, would stop any more information being given in confidence. The Minister concerned must of necessity take responsibility for decisions on these matters and so long as the House gives him its confidence its confidence must extend to such decisions. The same principles which apply to given information to the House apply to Select Committees. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Those are some of the general principles which are there laid out. The course of decision and discussion, as I have said, on some other matters that are also described in these pages is very instructive. I did not understand Senator Alston to be making any absolute claim. Perhaps if he were listening he would confirm what I am saying. If Senator Alston would do me the courtesy of listening to me it might be helpful. He has not shown me any other courtesy in the course of today, so I suppose it would be asking too much for him to break his duck at this stage. It is my understanding from what Senator Alston has said that he does readily accede to the proposition that I cannot be compelled to disclose certain information in respect of which I claim confidentiality, that I simply&mdash;as I understood Senator Alston to say in general terms&mdash;have to accept the political responsibility for doing so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply say to the extent that I do claim confidentiality in relation to any documents in part or whole&mdash;and I have not made any such decision about any document at this stage&mdash;then I will accept the political responsibility for doing so. But I do have other responsibilities as a member of this Government to my country and to individuals and to businesses which may be unjustly calumniated or whose interests may be put at risk by the disclosure of certain information. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I accept that I have responsibilities to disclose as much information as I reasonably can, having proper regard to proper and legitimate principles of confidentiality of the kind that I have mentioned. It was because of my willingness to have my bona fides tested in relation to the particular minute which has occupied so much attention in recent times that I not only tabled the document with one sentence omitted&mdash;which had to do incidentally with a matter of private family confidentiality so far as the individual was concerned&mdash;but I also actually offered Senator Hill the opportunity to look at the document to satisfy himself that the particular sentence that had been blacked out was of a character which did not go to a matter of public affairs but to a legitimate matter of confidentiality. He indicated that he was uninterested in any such opportunity. I noted that. Fair enough; if that is the way he wants to respond, that is fine. But do not call into account my bona fides when I try to wrestle with the very difficult and sensitive responsibilities that I have, on the one hand, to the Senate and to the public interest to put as much of this material down as I reasonably can but, on the other hand, to my country and to other individuals and interests that might be prejudiced by unreasonable disclosure. It is always a difficult task in executive government to strike that particular balance, to do it properly. I will do my best to do so, I will do so with honesty and integrity, and I hope my bona fides will not be calumniated by motions of this kind without proper ground in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as the timing of this is concerned, I simply have not yet had the time to work through the documents, to think about and apply the principles about which I have been talking today to each particular document, to each part of the document. Quite a significant stack of documents has by now accumulated, as I acknowledged last week, and it has just been impossible to go through them in the time available. At best, my Department's evaluation of this material which it has given me&mdash;most of it, not all of it so far&mdash;yesterday afternoon is a guide for the exercise of my judgment. I have asked it to have regard to the sorts of principles that are set out in the FOI legislation. I have not said it is a matter of being strictly bound by its provisions, because I frankly and fully acknowledge that it is not a matter of being strictly bound by it; it is a matter of applying the kinds of principles to which I refer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So this motion, brought on without any advance knowledge, in breach of all courtesies of this place, is not something that I believe the Senate should accede to at this point. I have given an explanation of my position. I hope that the Australian Democrats in particular will appreciate and understand the sincerity with which I have put my position. I am not trying to diddle anybody. I am not trying in any way to avoid proper responsibilities in this case. I do have some other serious responsibilities as well as those simply to dump everything on the table. I will try to exercise those responsibilities as expeditiously as I possibly can. I will certainly endeavour to meet the deadline that is being suggested or proposed, but I cannot absolutely guarantee at this stage that I will be able to. I will try but I cannot guarantee it; I will do my best. I will certainly do my best to disclose as much information as I possibly can, consistent only with the kinds of limitations which I described. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It seems to me that there are a couple of issues here that need to be teased out. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) has said&mdash;and I was pleased to hear him say it&mdash;the Freedom of Information Act does not apply literally to the question of the revelation of information by a Minister in this place. That seems to me to answer the first point which has been raised by the Opposition in putting forward this motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Minister then went on to say on several occasions that nonetheless he was applying the provisions of the FOI legislation to the information which was sought from him. We would accept&mdash;and I am sure the Opposition would also accept&mdash;that all information is not to be revealed in this place. The Minister has just outlined that there are a variety of circumstances under which information is not to be revealed. Equally, the Minister must accept that nowhere has the Senate said that the provisions which surround the release of information within the FOI legislation are the appropriate provisions to be used in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sections which he read from Odgers were very, very general. They certainly did not contain any specific criteria by which that would be measured. I certainly formed the impression, on those several occasions on which he invoked the FOI criteria in answer to a question, that he was in fact literally using those criteria as the criteria which were appropriate in this place. It seems to me that that is a matter to be determined by the Senate. It is not a matter to be determined by a Minister. If he were simply using it as shorthand, he should have made it quite explicit that it was shorthand for a set of criteria which were not exhaustively to be applied but were simply a guide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps a matter which this Senate needs to determine is what criteria should guide a Minister in relation to releasing information. Perhaps the provisions within the FOI legislation are appropriate, but it certainly has not been determined by the Senate. Therefore, I think the second leg of what the Opposition has put up does stand. We must accept what the Minister has said; that literally the law does not apply within the Senate. Nonetheless, it is for the Senate to determine the appropriate criteria by which information is to be guarded, if it is not to be released as a consequence of a question in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the time that has been set within this motion of 12 noon tomorrow, I certainly accept what the Minister has said&mdash;that he would seek to provide the information at that time. But I do think that in the replies given by the Minister there is an implication&mdash;a dangerous one if it is allowed to stand unchallenged&mdash;that the FOI provisions are perhaps appropriate ones. That is to be determined by the Senate, not by the Minister, and it should not be allowed to pass into history so that it becomes a precedent for Ministers seeking guidance in the future. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the reference to the Standing Orders committee, I mention for the first time in this debate standing orders 72, 73 and 74 in chapter 11 of our Senate Standing Orders relating to questions seeking information. I refer also to standing order 164 which refers to the tabling of documents and orders for the production of documents in chapter 26 of the Standing Orders. Given the statements made by the Minister in recent days, certainly any senator could interpret that he was seeking to make a precedent and to limit what a Minister's answer or tabling of documents would be in relation to these Standing Orders that I have just cited. That would be most improper. It is not the right of any one senator or any one Minister to subtract from or add to the Standing Orders of the Senate and it is for that reason that any such matter ought to be referred to the appropriate body, the Standing Orders committee, for consideration and report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no doubt that Senator Cooney is a first-class barrister, because if the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Evans) said the sorts of things that Senator Cooney alleges the Minister was saying, we would not be having this debate. The problem is that the Minister has not been saying those things at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister has now said on at least half a dozen occasions&mdash;it might have even been seven or eight&mdash;that, in effect, if the material he has in his office does not comply with the freedom of information regulations, he will not be tabling it in the Senate. That is what he has been saying in his answers. I agree that today he backed away from those claims. Today, when speaking to Senator Alston's motion, the Minister put the much more reasonable proposition that the freedom of information regulations simply give him some guideline for the sorts of matters that he ought to be taking into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the matter involves not only the freedom of information regulations. The Minister has drawn attention to the very important pages in Odgers' <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Senate Practice</EMPHASIS>, which set out in great detail the debates on these matters which have taken place until today. Today, the Senate had the privilege of receiving from our Clerk a document which sets out this matter very succinctly. I refer to the third paragraph of the Clerk's letter to Senator Alston, which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The question of whether there are any grounds on which ministers can decline to present documents to either House of the Parliament in response to orders of a House is one which has never been resolved&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>It is all right the Minister saying what he will take into account and all the rest of it, but as the Clerk goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and basically it cannot be resolved because it always turns itself into a political question.</PARA>
<PARA>That point is mentioned in Odgers. Very frequently, the question of whether a Minister reveals information becomes a political question as to whether the Government should be exposing itself to some severe criticism&mdash;maybe even a censure&mdash;by a House of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very interested to hear the Minister say that one of the factors he would take into account would be the consequences for Australia's international position. One only has to realise the depth of such a statement to come to appreciate that if, for example, the material which the Minister has were to reveal that a Minister of this Government in some way or other had behaved crookedly, that would be a matter of international concern which the Government may very well try to hide. But such a statement ought to be revealed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister made reference to a statement made to the Tasmanian House of Assembly in 1960 with approval, but he did not quote it all. I will quote the last paragraph of that statement, which is set out on page 912 of Odgers where the then Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I desire to make it clear to the House, however, that the Government has no wish to withhold from the House any information it is entitled to and that Ministers will not, without very good reason, refuse it any information.</PARA>
<PARA>If the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has in his possession documents which in some way or other reveal that a Minister of this Government has acted so improperly that it is a matter of international incident, notwithstanding the fact that that may very well damage our international reputation, it is a document which has to be revealed to the Parliament. That is the point I wanted to make. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have had a look at this motion and I have considered the contributions that have been made. It is my view that this motion is worthy of support. I say that for the simple reason that it is important to ensure that this Parliament, and this Parliament alone, has the responsibility of safeguarding the intent of its Standing Orders and its powers. We need this responsibility not for the purpose of satisfying the egos of members of the Senate who sit in this chamber, but for the very important purpose of exercising our audit and control functions over the executive government on behalf of the people of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we take the view, as has been taken by the Minister until today, that the freedom of information regulations should determine what should or should not be tabled in the Senate, clearly we are not doing our duty. We would be allowing the executive government, which determines those regulations, to determine what is or is not placed on the table of the Parliament. What Senator Cooney has said is not relevant. None of us in this chamber wants to see material tabled in this Senate&mdash;in other words, made public&mdash;which is private and confidential, which would affect an individual citizen and offend, interfere with and violate that citizen's right to privacy. That also goes for commercial-in-confidence material. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister has said today that he will use the FOI provisions as a guide to some of these things. He should realise that he may use them as a guide, but that he is held responsible by this Parliament for his duty to table a document which has been called for in a full and fair manner. In short, it is not for any outside body to determine this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I am on my feet, might I say that that is one of the reasons why I did not vote for the motion yesterday to request the Government to establish a judicial inquiry into, amongst other things, what should or should not be the proper conduct of Ministers. In my view, that is not an appropriate decision to be made by a judicial inquiry; it is a matter which, fairly and squarely, should be dealt with in this Parliament. I believe that I am taking a consistent approach to this matter. Therefore, I will be supporting the motion as moved by Senator Alston. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to another occasion, not quite as dramatic, which I remember well, as may some of the longer serving senators, during an Estimate committee in the old Parliament House. Senator Evans was in the chamber, where the Estimates committee was being held. Unfortunately for him, he had the microphone right in front of him.

I refer to the integrity of Senator Evans who was the Attorney-General at that time. Senator Harradine will remember that Senator Evans sent the F111 spy planes over western Tasmania to take photographs of the natives. He considered that the Tasmanian people would be frightened by an F111 flying over the western coast. The then Attorney-General of Australia gave instructions to the pilot of the F111 to be as inconspicuous as possible, and those instructions to the pilot were tabled in this Senate. I ask Senator Tate: we do not have many F111s flying over the west coast of Tasmania, do we?  Very few. I asked whether the Attorney-General had suggested that the pilot fly backwards so he did not look as though he was arriving. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I want to touch on a few of the comments made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) because I think they are relevant, notwithstanding the fact that we have clearly successfully headed off a ham-fisted attempt to water down and whittle away the powers of the Parliament. Senator Evans was able to keep a straight face when saying to this chamber that he had never seriously contemplated invoking FOI; indeed, all he was doing was using a shorthand expression. He was trying to say, in effect, that there are a series of criteria which guide the exercise of ministerial discretion, that these are sometimes enshrined in legislation, such as the Freedom of Information Act, and that therefore he was simply using that as a shorthand form of referring to general criteria.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it quite breathtaking to hear such a limp defence from Senator Evans. When I enunciated the various examples of where he had clearly relied on FOI in the most explicit terms, I was referring to instances such as this one, on 27 May, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yesterday I offered Senator Hill the opportunity to look at the file note in question on a confidential basis, pending an opportunity for me in turn to evaluate it for its releasability under FOI criteria.</PARA>
<PARA>It simply defies imagination. It is sophistry of the highest order to pretend that all he was doing was using a shorthand expression to suggest that somehow he was going to invoke the usual guidelines that might be relevant to the exercise of ministerial discretion. He was unequivocally intending to rely upon the FOI provisions. To have the cheek to say, `You're both premature and belated because no-one has picked me up on this in the last week' is absolutely no defence at all. He was basically trying to get away with it. He thought that, if he said it often enough, when the time came he would table these documents&mdash;a few whites amongst all the black pieces&mdash;and say, `No-one ever suggested this was improper; I have exercised FOI criteria. If you thought that was wrong, you should have told me'. But, of course, by then the Parliament would have risen for a week, the heat would be off, hopefully the journalists would have lost interest and he would have won the game. That is the thought process involved. It is utterly specious. Quite clearly, Senator Evans has known from the outset that FOI has no relevance at all. Yet he has consistently and repeatedly trotted it out in such a way as to make a bald assertion that he is entitled to rely on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the abject and humiliating back-down which we have seen today, but it still does not&mdash;as Senator Coulter rightly points out&mdash;absolve the Minister from a responsibility to cooperate with the Senate. I want to be quite clear on this. I notice that Senator Evans is no longer with us. I suppose if one asked, `What's the most impertinent way of contributing to a debate when you are the subject matter of it?', the answer would have to be, `To walk out half way through'. Yet this is the very person who accused me of discourtesy in not listening to what he was saying. In fact, I heard what he had to say and I want to respond to it now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister was suggesting that somehow we were not for a moment saying that he did not have all these powers and that therefore the Senate is very seriously constrained in terms of what it can do. He is absolutely wrong. That is not the correct state of affairs. The ultimate power resides in the Senate and it can resolve to compel the production of documentation and, indeed, witnesses&mdash;quite unconstrained. The practical reality is that both sides of politics acknowledge from time to time that there may be good cause why one would withhold certain material, whether it be on the grounds of national interest, national security, commercial-in-confidence, the jeopardising of relations between States and a whole range of other things. But it is not for the Minister to simply invoke those and say, `Here you are, I have given you what I deem to be your entitlement'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When push comes to shove, at the end of the day the Senate has an unfettered power to demand documents. Senator Evans can huff and puff as much as he likes. I am sure he would thrive, if he were in my position, on arguing very vigorously that nothing ought to constrain the power of the Senate. No-one would ever force the production of documents irrespective of the consequences. If they did, they would bear the political odium. There are practical constraints, if not legal ones, and they operate very effectively in the main. But it is simply not on for a Minister to unilaterally take it upon himself to decide what is and what is not disclosable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such defences as its not being in the national interest, or even commercial-in-confidence, can cover a multitude of sins. Anyone who has the slightest interest in being uncooperative can invoke all sorts of defences. That is why these things are tested in the courts of law. At one stage Senator Evans was suggesting that rights of natural justice ought to be accorded to anyone who might be the subject of an adverse comment. We know that that is a preposterous nonsense. That might be a requirement in administrative law. One may well have legal rights to pursue, but the Parliament is not so constrained. Senators and members have absolute privilege. At their peril, they will act irresponsibly but at the end of the day they are entitled to raise matters that in their judgment are very serious ones and they ought not to be limited simply because a Minister of the Crown thinks that it is proper to so limit them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the Minister's complete and utter repudiation of the claim. I therefore agree that the first part of the motion is no longer relevant because Senator Evans, by his own admissions, has walked away as fast as he could from a proposition that he has been seriously advancing for the last week or so. Therefore, I think we have achieved progress. But we have not obtained any assurances from him in relation to the second part of the motion. I therefore urge the Senate to support it in its entirety. Otherwise we will not be able to obtain access to material which has already been outstanding for more than a week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last Tuesday week the Minister spelt out that there were four categories of documents, that he was having a schedule prepared and that he hoped to be able to provide them shortly. Surely if there is one thing that Senator Evans ought to have learnt from the experience of the last couple of months it is that one cannot have a department and an office sitting back doing nothing. I will not make judgments about whether that is the reality. But I know that that is the Minister's defence&mdash;that somehow his officers chose not to do anything or if they did they did not tell him, and certainly he made sure that he was never made aware of any of the vital information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely, since the balloon has gone up, the highest priority for Senator Evans has been to try to straighten this matter out and to get all that material to the Parliament as quickly as possible. To pretend that somehow a week is not long enough and say that he hopes that maybe by tomorrow he will be in a position to produce the documents but cannot guarantee it is simply not good enough. After all, producing a schedule does not require anyone to laboriously summarise every document; it simply requires the documents to be itemised. Lawyers prepare affidavits of documents that go on for hundreds of pages. That could be knocked together in a few days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There cannot be any justification for Senator Evans delaying beyond tomorrow lunchtime. I therefore urge the Senate to require him to cooperate in those express terms. If we are able to ensure that the Senate's position is clear and unequivocal, Senator Evans in turn will be at last brought to heel and made to accept the fact that the Senate does have the power to take these actions. If at the end of the day he is prepared to discuss the matters with us, there is always room for negotiation about what is ultimately disclosable. But that has certainly not been the case to date and we are more anxious than ever to have the matter proceed. </PARA>

Senator Button's methods of answering questions when he is faced with the difficulties that he was in today are several.

Having spent an enormous amount of money, having set up nine committees which sat over a long period of time, and having involved the efforts of a large number of people both within the bureaucracy and outside, this Government is now saying, `We cannot afford to go down that road'. The Minister has to recognise that we cannot afford not to go down that road. The further we move away from ecologically sustainable patterns of development, the longer it will take and the more expensive it will be for our descendants, the worse will be the environment they inherit and the less able they will be to address the very serious industrial as well as environmental problems that we face. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UJ4">Senator WALTERS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Tate and I came to an agreement yesterday during the debate on the Appropriation Bills that, rather than hold up those Bills, the answers to a number of questions would be presented to me at lunchtime today. By far the majority of them I only received at five minutes to two, and I will not respond to those. If need be, I will take them up in the next set of Estimates hearings in September.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, one answer was presented to me much earlier and I would like to deal with it. It relates to Medibank Private brochures that were given to me. During the Estimates Committee hearings I spoke about the deal that was done between Medibank Private and the Public Sector Union. I believed that that special deal had been taken up by the Public Sector Union and Medibank Private. When I called it a deal in the Estimates Committee hearing Mr McNeil said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The package which has been said to be a special deal between Medibank Private and the PSU is, in fact, a table which is generally available to the public. It is available to anyone who wants to walk into the Medibank&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I showed some amusement at that, and Mr McNeil said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am sorry, Senator; it is. The table is available to other people besides PSU members.</PARA>
<PARA>We did not have the brochures at that stage. The brochure that I have now been given is directed solely at the Public Sector Union and, indeed, has a sticker on it saying, `PSU members only'. That is in complete contravention of the law. Medibank Private has indeed broken the law in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department says that that is only a technicality and that other funds have done the same. I would like to read very briefly the section that covers the breaking of that law. Section 73B(1)(b) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The organisation will include details of all tables of benefits in a brochure which shall be freely available and on display at any of its offices or outlets to any contributor or to any member of the public who is eligible to become a contributor.</PARA>
<PARA>These details, obviously, were not in the main brochure. This is a special brochure put out by the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services which, when opened, makes very clear that it applies to the Public Sector Union. It says, `Enjoy the PSU Advantage'. As I have already pointed out, Medibank Private is breaking the law by doing that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his answer to me, Senator Tate said that the Public Sector Union brochure is currently being reprinted to remove the exclusive `PSU members only' logo&mdash;that is the round logo in the corner of the front page. He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The PSU has been advised that this is in breach of the non-exclusivity clause of the agreement between the PSU and Medibank Private.</PARA>
<PARA>It would appear that it was not Medibank Private which drew up the brochure; it would appear that it was the union which did that. I said it was a deal between the Public Sector Union and Medibank Private. Mr McNeil assured me in the Estimates that it was not a deal done between them and that it was open to everyone. Yet we find that Medibank Private got the Public Sector Union to draw up the brochure. The PSU did that and, without knowing the law associated with this, the PSU breached the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is more than that. The answer I have is that the Public Sector Union has been told that it has to change this brochure, and that it breaches the clause of the agreement between the Public Sector Union and Medibank Private. The PSU has not been told that it also broke the law with the agreement. I have been sent, and have here, a photostat copy of the redesigned cover of the brochure, but that redesigned cover is also breaking the law. It states `QUALITY HEALTH COVER' and, `A PUBLIC SECTOR UNION ADVANTAGE PRODUCT'. It again shows just one table&mdash;the advantage table for the Public Sector Union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked how much the original glossy brochure cost&mdash;the brochure set up by the Public Sector Union that is illegal. The answer I received was $50,000. I was also told that that $50,000 covered the redesigned cover of the brochure which is also definitely breaking the law. I have been sent a copy of the cover, and have been very generously told that I can have a copy of the whole brochure on Friday, 5 June. I ask now how much more money of the contributors to Medibank Private is going to be wasted because that brochure cannot be used either. That new pamphlet cannot be used because the law says that there will be only one brochure and all tables will be in that particular brochure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know whether at this late stage the Minister is able to give me additional information arising from my questions&mdash;this is the problem we have when we pass appropriations when we have not got all the answers, I suppose. Could he find out how much that new brochure that is also going to be illegal will cost?  I hope I still get one tomorrow. Also, how long has this pamphlet been in existence? How many have been handed out? Where have they gone? Has the Public Sector Union handed them out? On how many other occasions has Medibank Private broken the law?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was told in the answer that it is true that Medibank Private&mdash;and, it would seem, some other health funds&mdash;are technically in breach of the National Health Act, as the Commonwealth Department of Health, Housing and Community Services wrote to all funds by way of a circular on 27 April. It was in breach of the Act well before that letter went out from the Commonwealth Department of Health, yet the Department says Medibank Private has only been in breach since the Commonwealth Department sent out that note. It has been in breach ever since the Act was passed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The questions I would like answered are: how long has this brochure been out? Was it handed around by the Public Sector Union or by Medibank Private? How long has Medibank Private been breaching the Act, breaking the law of the land? On how many other occasions has it broken the law by having single pamphlets rather than the one pamphlet? That will probably be all, but I suppose I can take it up again in the next Estimates hearings. Of course, by that time it will be all too late. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main reason for raising this is that I believe Medibank Private has behaved extremely irresponsibly for some time. As I indicated in Estimates, Medibank Private in Victoria transferred funds out of Victoria into New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia. It had been doing very well in Victoria, so it transferred $22.3m in 1983-84 out of Victoria into other States to help other States. It then lost $21.8m in 1989-90 and another $41m in 1991. So what did it do? It got Medibank Private in other States to transfer money back into Victoria. The shenanigans of the money passing around from State to State ended up in predatory pricing in Victoria whereby Victoria's Medibank Private undercut all the other major funds. It undercut the lot. When it was increasing its membership by undercutting all the other funds, it then had to be subsidised from other funds to make its loss into a profit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me to be an incredible situation for Medibank Private to be doing that with the funds, breaking the law in this situation, and no action being taken against it. I would be very grateful if the Minister could tell me when this pamphlet was first printed and why Medibank Private is printing yet another&mdash;this one I have here&mdash;since it received a letter on 27 April from the Department which advised that the Act requires that all funds include details of all tables available in the one brochure. </PARA>

I think it is a fair point that was raised last night to bring to the attention of the Senate the requirements of section 73B(1)(b) of the National Health Act. Indeed, it has been the subject of a circular from the Department to, as I understand it, all registered health benefits organisations, drawing to their attention the need to have details of all available tables contained within one brochure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said last night that I would not venture a legal opinion, though I did advise the managers of Medibank Private to seek one as a matter of urgency to ensure that they acted in accordance with the law and not simply in accordance with departmental circulars, accepted practice or whatever it might be. But I hazard the observation that it appears that what is required is that when one walks into a Medibank Private office there should be available for contributors or would-be contributors at least a brochure&mdash;a sort of catalogue or summary of all the various tables that might be taken up by a contributor. Whether it precludes a separate brochure dealing with one table, I do not know, but that is something on which quite clearly Medibank Private's manager should get urgent advice in order to be able to ensure that it conforms with the law. That would lead to different conclusions as to whether it was still valid to print what was formerly a PSU exclusivity type brochure. We will seek the further information. I assure Senator Walters that the general question of conformity with the National Health Act has been vigorously drawn to the attention of Medibank managers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Acting Deputy President, I withdrew the word deliberate and said `an untruth'. Please do not jump to the defence of this man in this way. It is not proper. This man got up and claimed under parliamentary privilege&mdash;he does not have the guts to say it outside&mdash;that I avoided prosecution over Patrick Partners only on a technicality. That is not simply an untruth; that is a blatant lie. It is disgraceful for the Prime Minister to respond when he has been caught the way he has been over his ownership of a company which hides a half ownership in another company and his declaration does not reveal the extent of that ownership. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that Mr Keating has been shown to be a closet millionaire socialist who has been outed. That is his problem. He has a $1m mansion in Elizabeth Bay; a half a million dollar investment company which is heavily involved in the pig industry; and an antique collection which is alleged to be worth very large amounts of money. On that basis, in the House of Representatives, he asked `Where did Dr Hewson's money come from?'. Let us ask Mr Keating. Let he who is without sin cast the first stone. Where did Mr Keating's money come from? How did this man who claims to have been a battler, who came up through the working class and who comes from Bankstown suddenly become a closet socialist millionaire who has been outed? It is a very interesting question. Maybe with Mr Keating's new found enthusiasm for revealing things about other people, he will reveal a few things about himself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of Patrick Partners was dealt with very thoroughly indeed in a report by Mr Masterman. All this happened back in 1975. Maybe Mr Keating does not have a long enough memory to recall what happened. In 1975 there was an inquiry into Patrick Partners which found that I was totally clear of any suggestion of knowledge that Patrick Partners had some financial difficulties at the time it was accepting deposits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report said that `he was satisfied that all the partners (with the exception of Mr Baume)'&mdash;and those brackets, by the way, are conveniently forgotten whenever the more disgusting elements of the Labor Party try to smear me&mdash;were aware, in his view, of the state of their finances at the time they were accepting deposits. I did not know because I had not been there for five months. It is a pity I had not been there for six months. I had not been there for five months. I was never an owner-partner of the firm. I was what is called a staff partner; I was an employee with the name `partner' on the top of the letterhead. There are many legal firms and accountancy firms around town in that situation. For smart alecs to try to drag this up to try to protect themselves from their own activities is absolutely disgraceful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interesting feature of Senator Tate's response yesterday, when I raised this matter of companies in the group in which Mr Keating has invested this enormously large amount of money for a battler who just has a job as a politician and no high paid activities on the public record, was that he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a matter entirely within the jurisdiction and discretion of the Australian Securities Commission.</PARA>
<PARA>Is it not marvellous? It was all within the discretion of the Securities Commission. Today, though, Senator Tate has been sufficiently active to be able to tell us that one of Dr Hewson's family companies put in a return on, I think he said, 3 February and it was due to go in on 31 January. Maybe Senator Tate does not realise that there was a weekend in between. That was a horrendous matter!<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He had enough interest and information to find out that kind of nonsensical situation. He did not have enough energy or enthusiasm to find out what happened to some serious, absolutely disgraceful, appalling delays. It is not a question of hiding from the public for a few weeks or a few months. I might agree with the Government: a few weeks or a few months can well be inconsequential; although, if one were the Prime Minister, one would think that one would be seeking to set a decent sort of standard.

I understand that the dispute is over the terms of its purchase of piggeries in 1988; about whether it should be required to maintain the purchases of stockfeed from Goodman Fielder Wattie.

We do not know because we have not seen the company returns for these companies. Quite frankly, this is not good enough. I would have hoped that the Minister in his response about delays in filing would have expressed some governmental concern about the fact that the requirements are being universally flouted. It may well be of little matter that they are universally flouted in respect of small family companies. But what is of major concern to me is where members of large financial groups have large external obligations and where some of those returns show that there have been secured debts incurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply want to conclude by saying that today in the other place this outed closet millionaire socialist Prime Minister accused Mr Howard and Dr Hewson of being traitors to their modest family backgrounds. This was a typical example of the way in which Mr Keating preaches class war. He did this while hypocritically pretending to be the guardian of the working class from his mansion in Elizabeth Bay, with his half a million dollars worth of pigs having their snouts in the trough&mdash;and I am not talking about his colleagues; I am talking about his real live pigs&mdash;along with his huge collection of antiques. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is incredible that this kind of silly diversion has been presented as some kind of fightback to the fact that the Prime Minister has been caught out by basically putting in a return about his interests which does not in any way reflect the substance of that investment.

It is not for me to direct, and nor would the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) direct, the Australian Securities Commission as to how it should deal with that phenomenon. I think it is fair to say that all I was recounting to the Senate was the general practice of the Australian Securities Commission, which is to issue penalty notices, warning notices and such like, and to try to deal with the matter in an administrative way rather than by exacting penalties if in fact there can be compliance within a reasonable time.</PARA></TALK.START>

I doubt whether he would have made that admission had we not exposed during Question Time today the failure of Dr Hewson and Mr Peter Reith to ensure that companies with which they were associated had lodged their returns by the due date. This exercise is now coming to a close in the sense that there is an admission by the spokesman for the Opposition on this matter&mdash;the person who has led the running on it&mdash;that if indeed the Prime Minister's family company did not lodge a return by the due date then, in Senator Baume's words, `that may well be regarded as a matter of little consequence'. It was certainly made into a matter of major consequence by the Opposition yesterday and beaten up into a tremendously exciting story, as Senator Baume hoped that it would be.

Rather than just the Prime Minister or the Prime Minister's private company failing to report, we find the same thing when we look at Brintmar Holdings and Co.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak briefly on the matter that Senator Knowles raised in response to the comments made by Senator Ray on the issue of taking note of answers to questions after Question Time. Senator Ray was right in saying that this is a procedure which, in recent months, has been perhaps more extensively used than previously in this chamber. I detected from what Senator Ray said that he did not think that that was altogether a bad thing. I was pleased that he noted that on many occasions this procedure of taking note of an answer after Question Time did, in effect, replace other matters that we have the right to bring before this chamber, in particular, matters of public importance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put on the record my belief&mdash;and this endorses Senator Knowles's remarks&mdash;that this has been a very important development in the procedures of the Senate. It has led to a very genuine debate after Question Time. In many ways, the debate during that hour or so when we take note of answers&mdash;which probably occurs on most days, I suspect&mdash;is important because it is in response to issues which the Government has raised during Question Time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather curiously, Senator Ray thought this whole matter could probably be considered by the Standing Committee on Procedure. I am not altogether sure why that should be the case. I have no particular reason to object to that, but it is fairly clear to me that senators on both sides of the chamber show a willingness to use this particular time in the Senate. The senator on the other side of the chamber who tends to speak most in the debates on the taking note of answers is in the chamber now&mdash;Senator Cook. I can recall earlier this week, or perhaps at the end of last week&mdash;as the time goes by, it is sometimes hard to remember&mdash;that Senator Cook took up close to a full half hour after Question Time making further points. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I wish to raise in the chamber now is made in light of Senator Ray's comment&mdash;with which I said I agreed&mdash;that this was a new procedure. The other new procedure which has come about, which was not raised by Senator Ray, is the astonishingly low number of questions answered in the course of Question Time. I had cause in this chamber the other night to bring to the attention of the Senate that, over the period of the Hawke-Keating Government, it has answered, on average, six fewer questions per day than all the other governments for which we have statistics on record. Senator Cook would be interested to know that six fewer questions each day over the seven-day parliamentary cycle is 42 fewer questions over that period. That means that, if this Government had come reasonably close to answering the number of questions that all other governments for which we have statistics on record were able to answer, every senator in this chamber would probably have a chance to ask at least one and sometimes two further questions during the course of a seven-day parliamentary cycle. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>The Senate has before it the Auditor-General's report No. 38 for 1991-92 entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Department of Defence, Management of Army Training Areas</EMPHASIS>. It is always interesting to have a report by the Australian National Audit Office. They are always valuable, because they are usually very thoroughly done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said over many years in this chamber, the application of the Australian National Audit Office to military affairs is often constrained by the approach that the Audit Office brings to what is essentially not a commercial venture. There are, of course, excellent accountants in the Audit Office who tend to look at things in terms of balance sheets and see things in a commercial way. If there is one thing the Department of Defence is not, it is a commercial operation. That does not deny the need for accurate cost accounting for Defence. Those who have listened to me over the years would know that I have always made a plea for more accurate cost accounting for the Department of Defence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We simply must know what it is costing to provide a certain capability in the Defence Force. We do not have that precise information. A simple example is the questions I have asked over the years in relation to the VIP squadron at Fairbairn providing VIP transport for the Parliament and dignitaries. The best one can get from the Air Force or the Department of Defence on the cost of that squadron is a rough approximation from the number of personnel involved, the lease costs of the aircraft and the fuel bill. It is really quite imprecise and will not give us the sort of data that we need to make an accurate assessment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we move to higher technology and, therefore, far more expensive capital equipment programs with the Australian Defence Force, the need to be able to measure costs accurately becomes more and more important. Having said that, we must not let the cost accountants make decisions. They must be there in an advisory capacity, providing information as to what services cost. They must not be in a position where they can say, `You can't afford that', which is always the risk when these people are around. They are collectors of information; they are not approvers of what equipment should be bought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the day, defence is a very expensive activity. It must be efficient if we are going to maintain an adequate Defence Force and the Australian public must get value for money. There is a place for the Australian National Audit Office to be continually overseeing what the Department is doing. I hope that it uses a little more sophistication in its assessment techniques than it has up to the present time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report deals with army training areas. I would like to make a few general observations on that at the start. First of all, all services need training areas. The defence forces have to exercise their personnel, they have to exercise using their equipment and they have to have live firing exercises on ranges which demand reasonably extensive safety zones. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Defence Force is not part of the civilian world. To look at its assets&mdash;whether it is in terms of equipment or land&mdash;through the eyes of normal commercial practice is quite inappropriate, because the Australian Defence Force expands and contracts according to the strategic situations that we find ourselves in from time to time. At the moment we are in a period of contraction, but it would only need some slight change in the environment for the activities and resources diverted to defence to increase and increase quite considerably. In more passive times, the requirements would diminish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The assets that we require in the form of land do change from time to time but, in the long term, there is a degree of predicability that we will certainly need them. The actual extent to which we need them varies from time to time. Superimposed on that is the changing technology of modern weapons systems. The size of ranges increase, as do safety areas. In the debate on the motion of the Australian Democrats about Shoalwater Bay, I spoke of how, with the introduction of laser guided and precision guided munitions, et cetera, the size of safety ranges goes up four, five or 10 times what is required for high explosives. If precision guided munitions are going to be used with laser guidance, the safety distances will go up very considerably. So the area of land needed also goes up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Defence Force is in the business of defending this country into the foreseeable future. Any thinking about its land use resources must be measured in terms of centuries, not years or decades. We really have very few training areas in Australia for the defence forces. All the training areas are defined in this document before us. Of the areas on the east coast, Shoalwater Bay is the only large training area. The high range area at Dotswood station is used by Lavarack barracks in Townsville. We have also areas in the Wide Bay district, but they are really quite a deal smaller than Shoalwater Bay. One or two training areas are used on the west coast. There is also an area used by Tindal in the Northern Territory. In aggregate, we really have very few large training areas within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need a variety of terrain in training areas. The forces cannot be trained in one area, because one can literally reach the stage where the troops know every tree, gully and rock. It is therefore very difficult to introduce variety into training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Training areas also have to be accessible because there is a great economic cost in moving troops and equipment to them. Most equipment, whether it be tanks or APCs, is pretty heavy; ammunition is also a very heavy commodity. The cost of moving a regiment out of Holsworthy in the west of Sydney up to Shoalwater Bay for an exercise would easily run into hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars. So the availability of areas close to main camp sites becomes very important. In addition, from the point of view of maintenance of the environment, it is important that there are enough training areas so that troops are not moving over the same piece of ground the whole time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It follows from that that the Australian Defence Force needs a long term policy for land use which should be measured in terms of centuries, not today's needs. If the ADF sees a requirement for exercises in the next five or 10 years, it should not have to go out and buy land and relinquish it after the exercises are over. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been in the Senate for 14 years during which time my major interest has been in defence. One of my constant interests has been the need to get a long term land requirement and land usage program for the Australian defence forces. Unless we define what areas we need and acquire that land while it is available, in another 10 or 20 years it just will not be available at an economic cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By and large, the training areas that we want for the defence forces are not in urban areas. The only requirement in urban areas is land which is used for residential or administrative purposes. In rural areas, where the principal requirement is, we rarely need high value land. We certainly do not need high value agricultural or farming land. Most of the training areas that are acquired are on grazing land&mdash;usually, the less desirable grazing land&mdash;or crown land. By and large, crown land has remained as such because it is not terribly useful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the point raised in the Auditor-General's report that the requirements of the Australian Defence Force in the years ahead should be defined. We should move to acquire that land. The report tends to look at this matter on an instant use basis. In particular, the report says that the training area in Western Australia, which was acquired in 1978, has never been used for large formation exercises. That cuts no ice with me at all. I am looking well into the next century. We will certainly use this area at a future date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that must be emphasised is the need for size. I have talked about being able to introduce variety into training&mdash;that we cannot have soldiers knowing exactly where every tree is so that in day or night they can just move blindfolded through an area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other very important point is that, given the dry and friable nature of Australian soils, once exercises start and troops and vehicles are moved&mdash;particularly tracked vehicles which are chosen for cross-country use&mdash;a great deal of damage can be done if troops run over precisely the same area all the time. The Army has followed a practice of having large training areas, of using areas in sequence and, just as a farmer does with fallow fields, letting them recover for years before moving back into them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against that background and by way of introduction, I will deal with the key findings in the front of this report, because they cover in an encapsulated form what the report is all about. The first point that the Auditor-General makes is that there was inadequate control at the corporate level over the Army's training estate of 1.37 million hectares. That really relates to what I was talking about with respect to long term land usage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point deals with unexploded ordnance in former training areas. The Auditor-General is apparently not clear about the fact that the Army, above all the other services, has a very real interest in knowing the location of unexploded ordnance such as unexploded bombs and shells. After all, trucks and APCs run over these areas. There may have been a more casual approach in the past 40 or 50 years, particularly with the high intensity training that took place during the Second World War, to where ordnance was fired. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In modern practice, the services are very careful to watch the fall of shot and to determine that fired shells do go off. If they do not, they go out and look for them. They do not always find them, but they certainly have a vested interest in finding and detonating explosives so that they are not a threat to anyone later on. One always has to remember that there is always a cycle of postings in the services. An entirely different group of administrative officers could be running a training area from year to another. So the institutional need to know where things are that have not gone off really becomes quite important. The way to handle that is to try to minimise those numbers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also differ with the Auditor-General's statement that the high explosive impact areas should be kept as small as possible. A lot of damage is caused by the detonation of high explosives. Big craters are created if ordnance&mdash;be it a shell or a bomb&mdash;is detonating after it falls and is buried below the ground. It is very destructive to use one particular area for the detonation of high explosives. While wanting to keep such an activity confined&mdash;not spread all over the training area&mdash;some degree of dispersal becomes essential if the environment is to be protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point made by of the Auditor-General relates to the inadequacies in the procedures for training area acquisitions. I agree with him. The matter should be fully researched before any purchases are made and it should fill a need. The Auditor-General said that the Yampi Sound training area in Western Australia has never been used for large formation exercises. The cost of the land was really quite minimal because no-one wanted it when it was bought back in 1978. The holding costs of that land have really been peanuts. The land has been held at a peppercorn rental from 1978 onwards. To say, as the Auditor-General does, that there has never been any large formation exercises there is to miss the point that we want it for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point raised in the report is the level of repair and maintenance funding. That is a very real point. The Services have been active in repair of the training areas, but they are constrained by a falling defence Budget. Quite simply, defence does not get enough money. That is something which has to be corrected. Damage to training areas will not be corrected until the defence vote goes up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point raised is the environmental policy of the Department of Defence, which has been in draft form for eight years. Later in the report the Auditor-General comments on the environmental policies of the Department of Defence. That is misleading. In my experience, going back to the mid-1950s, the Australian defence forces were conscious of environmental matters long before they became popular public issues. The defence forces have spent money on environmental matters. The testimony of that is to go through the intensive training areas at Holsworthy, Puckapunyal, Seymour, et cetera. If the land had not been looked after 30 or 40 years ago, it would just be wasteland today; it is not. The Auditor-General is calling for a more refined and developed set of policies than are in place. It is misleading to create the impression that nothing is being done in that direction. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without delaying the Senate too long, I must say that I have found the Scrutiny of Bills Committee to be rather refreshing and unique. I have practised law in Queensland all of my life. I found it quite incredible that somewhere in Parliament there is a committee which genuinely looks through Bills to make sure that they did not trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties; a committee which watches all legislation to make sure that rights, liberties and obligations are not unduly dependent upon insufficiently defined administrative powers; and a committee which checks legislation to make sure that rights, liberties and obligations are not unduly dependent upon non-reviewable decisions and that legislation does not inappropriately delegate legislative power, nor that legislation insufficiently subjected the exercise of legislative powers to Parliamentary scrutiny. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I am quite sure that the current Government is no better. In fact, I am sure that it would be worse than the previous Government. As one who grew up as a lawyer in the areas concerned, I took as common place some of the powers which were given to the executive and the authorities in Queensland by State Parliament legislation. When I came down here I found that some parliamentarians, particularly senators, made a practice of going through legislation. It was a cultural shock to me. That might explain why, in my practice of 20 years or so in law in Queensland, I always seemed to have problems with State legislation but never with Federal legislation. At the time I thought it might have been how it was. In retrospect, now that I understand how things operate in the Federal Parliament, I understand the work that this Committee and other elements of this chamber undertake to look after legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Who will forget December 1991 when this Parliament passed legislation which substantially strengthened the financial disclosure obligations of political and third parties? However, the disclosure section of the legislation was, I believe, rather overshadowed by the passion engendered by the debate on the section of the Bill regulating political advertising. The main disclosure effects of the 1991 legislation are: that registered political parties must lodge annual returns of all income, expenditure and debts; that third parties who participate in the electoral process must disclose gifts made by them to political parties; and that the Australian Electoral Commission has been given enhanced powers to conduct random spot audits to ensure compliance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These changes cumulatively achieve a very high standard of accountability and transparency&mdash;standards that were long overdue. Such standards have resulted, on reflection, in an unwarranted administrative burden upon political parties in so far as they rely on volunteers at local branch level to keep branch accounts and other records. Under the December 1991 legislation, political parties are obliged to record certain information on every single transaction entered into by the party and its constituent organs. The difficulties for political parties arising from this particular requirement are quite clearly canvassed in the second reading speech of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook). In the interests of time, I will not go over them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the Democrats' belief that the amendments proposed in the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill 1992 are a reasonable approach to the administrative problems outlined without watering down the improved full disclosure and transparency requirements. The major provisions of this Bill that I would draw attention to which the Democrats are pleased to see are: those provisions which decrease the administrative burden on registered political parties by providing that amounts of less than $100 received from a person or organisation at a fundraising event need not be recorded in annual returns; the provision which decreases the administrative burden on registered political parties by providing that payments of amounts less than $100 need not be recorded in annual returns; and the provision which increases the time for agents to complete and furnish annual returns from eight weeks after the end of the financial year to 20 weeks after the end of the financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats support this Bill but we anticipate a machinery Bill later in the year which will afford us the opportunity to address such important topics as the office of profit under the Crown, something which I am sure we would all like to see tackled before the impending Federal election. I think the passage of this Bill will set at rest the anxiety of many hardworking and local branch members of all political parties who have been mortified at the prospect of being caught up for failing to record the identification of all persons purchasing raffle tickets, even to the value of as low as $1, at any sort of local branch fundraising event. It is easy to see how omissions could quite easily occur and how the intention of the person would certainly not have been to flout the legal obligations. In seeking to cast the net widely in this legislation, we have inadvertently caught a lot of the baby fish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The enhanced random auditing power of the Electoral Commission will underpin all of these amendments. The Democrats think that that is an extra power which will enhance compliance. There are those in the community who, for obvious reasons, still do not want us to see the connection between money given to political parties and influence which may be exerted. But fortunately as a community we continue to move towards higher standards of political accountability and such desires will not and cannot be accommodated. </PARA>

On 6 May 1987 Senator Ray did refer to Lindsay Fox. In the context of the need to have disclosure law to protect democracy in this country, he made reference to the good relations that Fox had with the unions. He also went on to make reference to the fact that if Fox donated $1m and suddenly a Liberal government started using his company, anyone would be entitled to know. In raising both those aspects, Senator Ray was stressing the point that disclosure laws act to protect democracy. He was not in any way intimidating Mr Fox.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to Senator Kernot's first question, the effect of the legislation is that, although those amounts would not be disclosed, they would still have to be identifiable and identified. That being the case&mdash;and just referring back to the point Senator Kernot made in the second reading debate that the power to spot audit is still in existence&mdash;that power obviously acts as a capacity in the Commission to ensure that there is no unhealthy non-disclosure or avoidance of the legislation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It does not change it at all. The advice as I have received it from the Electoral Commission is that, in respect of gifts, the Commission would continue to apply its longstanding interpretation of voluntary labour supplied for the benefit of political parties. That interpretation can be found in the Election Funding and Financial Disclosures Handbook issued by the Commission. To generalise that and put it simply, that interpretation means that a service provided free of charge will amount to voluntary labour provided it is not a service that the person performing it normally charges for.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One example that has been raised in recent days is whether the group of six accountancy firms providing voluntary labour for the Liberal Party and the Fightback package would amount to disclosable contributions. Under the definition used by the Commission, that would very much be a disclosable contribution and they would have to disclose the extent to which the labour and the expertise they have provided has cost them. So there is no change in the longstanding definition of voluntary labour by this legislation. It is a definition which has been applied by the Commission since 1984. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition supports the Ozone Protection Amendment Bill 1992. Not only do we support this Bill, we have consistently advocated an accelerated commitment to the phasing out of CFCs, which is part of this Bill, because we are concerned about the ozone layer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policy adopted by the Opposition in 1990 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to CFCs, we commend the positive steps taken by industry to move to eliminate the use of CFCs in Australia and we will act to ensure their complete elimination (excluding medical and pharmacological uses) by a target date of 1995. The export of CFCs and halons will be banned. We will work for further revisions of the provisions of the Montreal Protocol to the Vienna Convention on the protection of the earth's ozone layer to facilitate international cooperation in these endeavours.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a major environmental issue on which there is bipartisan support for the actions taken by the Government. In this case, in fact, the Opposition adopted a target which was five years in advance of the international protocol. Naturally, now that the Government is legislating to bring the Australian legislative framework into line with the accelerating international framework&mdash;that is, to bring the target date back to 1997&mdash;it clearly has our support although 1995 remains, quite frankly, our target date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this matter was first raised, the Opposition urged the Government to use its best endeavours to encourage Australian industry to replace ozone depleting substances, and achieve faster and greater reductions in the levels of production and use of ozone depleting substances than are provided for in the convention on the protocol, to the extent that such replacements and achievements are reasonably possible within the limits imposed by the availability of suitable alternative substances and appropriate technology and devices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This qualification is necessary because there are technical difficulties which we must deal with in a practical and timely way in getting rid of CFCs. I think it is worth pointing out that, over a period of years, the political parties here have been prepared to acknowledge the significant dangers which exist in the area of ozone depletion and have taken, and are taking, legislative action to reduce those dangers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is often a lot of criticism of politicians not responding adequately and properly to matters of concern like this. I hope it gives confidence to those concerned people in the community to see this sort of cooperation. It is not simply a cooperation between the two major political parties&mdash;and I exclude the Democrats because they are about to embark on a stunt which has little substance. It is interesting to see this cooperation between government and industry, between political parties, between government and consumers, and between industry and consumers in Australia and of course between governments around the world. Virtually all the players have moved to accept that there is a significant problem which needs remedial action and each has chosen to play its part in a most constructive way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Actions by consumers in Australia, by the way, have in effect been in advance of the legislative requirements&mdash;and I commend consumers for that. This consumer led movement has encouraged manufacturers to label products as being `non-CFC'. In fact, it was seen by manufacturers as a positive marketing mechanism proudly to say that they do not have CFCs in them. That sort of cooperation has led to the sort of movement whereby Australia is quite properly and successfully taking positive measures to resist this movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are the Australian Democrats doing in this situation?  Here we have agreement between industry and consumers. We have agreement between the Government and the Opposition. We have agreement internationally to resolve this matter, through protocols and so on. And this legislation has to be passed by tomorrow because that is the very last day for the legislation to pass so that Australia can ratify the 1990 changes to the Montreal protocol in the time allowed. If the Democrats did not know that, they ought to know it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Democrats are doing here is setting out on a diversionary stunt. In fact, they are tainting&mdash;I suppose one could almost say polluting&mdash;this argument, this clear sense of agreement and this clear thrust towards improving the situation; they are polluting it with a side issue. I will say why this is a side issue. It might be an issue of major substance to the Democrats, but it is a matter of major disagreement which they are now seeking to introduce into an area of absolute, overwhelming consensus where here we are in a parliament achieving an important objective which will cease the damaging impact on the ozone layer of CFCs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats are trying to drag into this situation the very general question of the problems of atmospheric pollution. They are trying to include the greenhouse effect&mdash;which, by the way, has created and is still creating massive scientific disagreement&mdash;and other matters. They are trying to impose these things on a situation where this Parliament is almost unanimous in resolving a clear and significant matter which must be resolved by tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know what the Democrats' objective is. I merely note that the terms of their proposed amendment seem to follow straight down the line the briefing that they no doubt have achieved from the Australian Conservation Foundation. Many of the words in this stunt seem to be very similar. I do not know whether they regard that as their constituency. All I say about this is that the purpose of this Democrat amendment that we are dealing with now is to bring hydrochlorofluorocarbons&mdash;that is, HCFCs&mdash;under the same regimen of control and phase them out in the same way as would apply to CFCs. In other words, here we have a situation where, to solve our ozone problems, we have the opportunity of manufacturers moving into what is understood to be an acceptable, even if temporary, solution, at least in terms of the ozone problem&mdash;</PARA>

But here we have agreement for many people&mdash;not all of them, but it appears likely to be 40 per cent or so of current CFC users&mdash;to move to HCFCs. As I have said, this probably will be on a temporary basis while technological change develops, along with the adaptability of equipment to other forms&mdash;for example, to just HFCs which are not at this stage readily available overall.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This temporary and very useful solution to the problem of CFCs is being attacked by the Democrats as somehow disgraceful. It is extraordinary that a solution being pressed for by tomorrow for the problem we face on CFCs, a solution which will reduce the danger of CFCs, is being attacked, basically, by the Australian Democrats. They will have to put an extremely strong case to demonstrate that there is any merit whatsoever in their undermining of this move out of CFCs by blocking the use of what is generally regarded as an acceptable but temporary solution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to speak at great length, but there is no doubt that the industry&mdash;which is in total agreement with the Government and the Opposition&mdash;sees the Democrat proposal as premature and unwarranted. It says that no assessment has been made that would justify this and that to impose a control regime on these substances would be asking for trouble in that the problems experienced with regulating quotas for CFCs would most probably be repeated. The fact is that the changes to the Act provided for in this legislation will give the Government greater freedom to operate in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Democrats think there is a real risk in this and are concerned about it, I wonder whether they are aware of the fact that the changes to the Act provided for in this legislation will give the Government greater freedom to operate in the future; for example, by regulation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for the Democrats' proposed amendment to change the name of the legislation to the `Atmosphere Protection Act', it simply cannot be done and they know it.

<PARA>If the position of the Democrats has any substance, it will be discussed in November at the international protocol meeting. Why do the Democrats have some special insight that people who have been involved in this have not yet had and where the issue can be determined quite properly at the November meeting? Regulations, as I said, can be and will be made only in response to changes in the protocol which follow comprehensive scientific assessment and international negotiations. If the Democrats are fearful that comprehensive scientific assessment will not demonstrate their particular position, I can understand their trying to muck up this bit of legislation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have just witnessed the most incredible demonstration of lack of knowledge in this area that it has ever been my misfortune to listen to. The scientific evidence in relation to ozone depletion from HCFCs is well established; it is on the record. The Australian Democrats have no intention at all of holding up the Ozone Protection Amendment Bill, as indicated by the previous speaker, Senator Michael Baume.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we recognise that we have a very damaging technology and that there is the need to move to a new technology, it is demonstrably stupid to make an investment of billions of dollars in a technology which one already knows is only temporary. Senator Baume has agreed that the HCFC technology is only temporary. HCFCs certainly have less ozone depleting potential than CFCs, but it is well established that they have that ozone depleting potential. Almost certainly, very shortly HCFCs will come under consideration and will be included. If in the meantime Australia has spent millions, possibly billions, of dollars&mdash;certainly tens of billions of dollars worldwide&mdash;going down the HCFC road, we have done our dough. The one thing that we are trying to achieve in this is not to go up blind alleys. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CFCs, like HCFCs, are very potent greenhouse gases and are altering the characteristics of the global atmosphere very significantly. HCFCs, while not containing any chlorine, are nonetheless very potent greenhouse gases. We are very concerned that we take a broader view of this question. We should move beyond the question simply of ozone depletion and look at the question as one of continual and exacerbating damage to the global atmosphere and seek to put in place a series of industrial changes which will comprehensively address that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is certainly true that in this context this Bill is giving effect to the updated Montreal Protocol. However&mdash;and I make this point again&mdash;those international agreements into which Australia has entered set only minimum standards. They do not mean that Australia cannot go further in seeking to include substances which are not yet in the schedules&mdash;substances which are recognised as being ozone depleting and as being potent greenhouse gases. Australia certainly can go further and, in the process, establish some industries which would be extremely useful to this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If HCFCs are only 5 per cent as ozone depleting as CFCs, and if we are to go down the road of establishing an industry exporting refrigeration into China&mdash;and as I reminded the Senate when I put up my first Bill, which preceded the Government's Bill by quite some time, China has 60 times our population&mdash;the damage to the global ozone from HCFCs will far exceed that which now exists from CFCs. For the reasons of the very large capital investment necessary to use these alternatives, it is very important that we do not go down blind alleys. We have gone down too many blind alleys with industry in this country in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats are supporting the purpose of this Bill. There is no question that we are not supporting it. We are seeking, however, to broaden the application of the Bill. We believe that is absolutely appropriate, given the fact that there is continual, accelerating and exacerbating change in the global atmosphere from a whole range of gases, CFCs being only one of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to ozone depletion, the situation is indeed more serious than the models have indicated hitherto. Michael Kurylo, a research manager at the National Aeronautical and Space Administration, was prompted recently to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Everybody should be alarmed about this.</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the increase in the ozone damage beyond that which was expected. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We're seeing conditions primed for ozone destruction. It's in a far worse way than we thought.</PARA>
<PARA>We are dealing with a problem that, together with the greenhouse effect, must be regarded as the gravest problem facing human kind today, and one that has profoundly worrying implications for future generations. It is not just ozone depletion we are talking about; we are perturbing the composition of the global atmosphere in ways without any former precedents throughout history. For this reason, we must ensure that legislation is passed which will minimise further thinning of the ozone layer and damage in other respects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The development of the ozone layer was an essential ingredient before which life on dry land could not exist. We need to recognise that tearing that protective layer away leads to a situation in which life on land may well become increasingly more difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ozone hole over the Antarctic came as a shock to the scientific community. Senator Baume talked about the good behaviour of those who use CFCs as propellants in cans. They were dragged screaming to that situation and they have now sought to make a virtue of necessity. It took four or five years for them to even recognise that there was a problem. They resisted, as does Senator Baume, the scientific evidence in relation to global atmospheric damage and change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have beyond the ozone hole over the Antarctic the recent unexpected and extremely grave discovery of very significant ozone depletion over more populous regions in north America, Asia and Europe. In early February, NASA announced the highest levels of ozone depleting chemicals ever recorded over north America. The result was swift action by the Bush Administration to accelerate the phase-out of CFCs and halons. Therein is another interesting observation: the American Government, as we have seen in the way it has addressed the UNCED conference, will not do anything unless it sees it in its interest. We demand a much more holistic approach to these issues than we are seeing from either this Government or the US Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ozone layer is thinning at all latitudes, including the tropics, where significant and unexpected losses have recently been discovered. Globally, it is estimated that there has been a loss of approximately 2.5 per cent in the ozone layer. The potential impact of ozone loss on world food production is enormous. According to the CSIRO Division of Plant Industry, under high ultraviolet B radiation, photosynthesis in certain plants, particularly wheat, sorghum and peas&mdash;essential crops for human nutrition for future generations&mdash;can be severely affected . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Research from overseas has found that ultraviolet radiation can also stunt the growth of pine trees and cause damage to marine phytoplankton&mdash;which, I remind the Senate, is the world's largest sink for carbon from the atmosphere, and that is the important intersection between ozone depletion and the greenhouse effect. Marine phytoplankton act as such a sink that some five billion tonnes of carbon dioxide is taken up in that source every year. To the extent that it sinks into the deep ocean, it sequesters carbon out of the atmosphere. Loss of phytoplankton can therefore gravely accelerate the problem of global warming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The alarming concentration of ozone-depleting chemicals in the atmosphere calls for an approach to their control on the precautionary principle&mdash;a principle which, clearly, Senator Baume does not accept or probably does not even understand&mdash;the fundamental principle on which ecologically sustainable development is built. The precautionary principle reverses the onus of proof. Instead of waiting for scientific certainty, instead of waiting until the environment is irreparably damaged, if there are reasonable grounds for believing that the environment is being damaged, then action can be taken to ensure that it does not happen. It protects the environment against environmental damage on the balance of probabilities because this planet is the only habitable planet in our corner of the universe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings me to the Bill which is before us. As I have said, the Democrats support the dual aims of this legislation, namely: to give effect to the amendments of the Montreal Protocol; and, to enable Australia to ratify the amended protocol. However, we would observe, as Senator Baume has observed, that this is the last day on which Australia would be allowed to do that. Rather than praising the actions of the Australian Government, I point out that it has been particularly tardy in not having moved with this legislation much earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats support the extension of the quota control system provisions of the Act to encompass the 10 additional CFCs and trichloromethane&mdash;colloquially called methylchloroform. We also support the introduction of a restricted licence system for carbon tetrachloride and for the export of halons and trichloromethane. However, we have two major concerns with the Bill as it currently stands. The first relates to the class of chemicals called the HCFCs&mdash;the hydrochlorofluorocarbons. The second relates to the chemicals called the hydrofluorocarbons. The Bill before us requires that importers and manufacturers of HCFCs report on the quantities being imported or manufactured. There is an urgent need for this reporting. I have found it impossible to collect data on current levels of HCFC usage in Australia. However, I believe that the Bill should go further and adopt a truly precautionary approach to CFC replacement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings me to the crux of this issue. As pressure mounts to phase out CFCs, industry has sought to develop replacements which are more benign to the ozone layer. Industry has already begun to invest millions of dollars in the development of HCFCs and HFCs. HFCs do not contain chlorine, as I explained earlier, and are therefore not ozone-depleting. On the other hand, HCFCs do contain the damaging chlorine atom. A few years ago the HCFCs were hailed as being the answer to the CFCs. Although they still depleted the ozone layer, it was thought that their impact was negligible. It has now come to light that the HCFCs are three to five times more damaging than previously thought. It is estimated that CFC-11 and CFC-12 remain in the stratosphere for between 75 and 150 years. It was previously thought that the HCFCs remained in the stratosphere for an average of eight years. However, researchers from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported last year in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Journal of Physical Chemistry</EMPHASIS> that this has now been extended to 13 years. The Washington-based Institute for Energy and Environmental Research has found that HCFCs are 95 per cent less ozone-depleting than CFCs only if it is assumed that the alternatives release chlorine at the same slow rate. The HCFCs, of course, degrade more rapidly and free chlorine faster than previously thought. The Institute's report calls for a phase-out of HCFC-22&mdash;which has been in common use for many years&mdash;by the year 2005, 25 years earlier than the planned US phase-out date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some companies have already responded to the growing international concern about HCFCs. The German company Hoechst, for example, has decided not to proceed with the production of these chemicals, although it is considering going ahead with the production of the HFCs depending upon the results of toxicity tests. American Democrat Senator Albert Gore has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's a mistake to replace one ozone-destroying chemical with another. Any added increments at this point represent true insanity.</PARA>
<PARA>Across the Atlantic, the UK Stratospheric Ozone Review Group reported in 1991 as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Anything other than modest substitution of HCFCs and CFCs could both increase the peak chlorine loading and sustain for decades unprecedented levels of stratospheric chlorine.</PARA>
<PARA>Certainly, there will be major costs involved in phasing out HCFCs. However, the earlier a phase-out date is established the lower the costs will be. That is why we are seeking to move to not allow this substitution to occur at this time by including them in the schedule. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill before this chamber allows the Minister, as Senator Baume has said, to use regulations rather than legislative amendments to respond to future amendments to the protocol. This would allow the Minister to include by regulation HCFCs in the list of scheduled substances. However, Australia would regain its prominence in international efforts to control ozone-depleting substances if it adopted unilaterally a phase-out date for HCFCs and would at the same time gain a significant advantage for Australian industry in so doing by making the obvious next jump in its industrial development. This prominence has been considerably dented by the tardiness of the Government in getting the amendments to the protocol into this chamber&mdash;a matter to which I referred just a moment ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, I will move an amendment to include HCFCs under the licensing system established by the Principal Act and extended by this amending Bill. That means that HCFCs would no longer be defined as `transitional substances', a transition which, I believe, we should and can avoid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the question of HFCs. Du Pont (Australia) announced at a recent ozone conference in Canberra that, ultimately, all industry must be using HCFs. That might be good news for the ozone layer, as HFCs do not destroy ozone, but it is bad news for the greenhouse effect. That is because HFCs&mdash;and HCFCs, for that matter&mdash;have significant global warming potential. It is critical that we respond to ozone depletion in a way that does not add to our problems elsewhere in the environment. If we take the precautionary principle seriously, then we must not allow industry to move in this environmentally damaging direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this connection I point out that for well over 100 years we have had a technology&mdash;a very energy-efficient technology&mdash;which would allow us to totally avoid this transition, and that is the technology for refrigeration which is dependent upon ammonia. Ammonia is a substance which is readily available and manufactured in Australia. It is cheap. Most large commercial refrigeration establishments have already used it for well over 100 years and still continue to use it. Of course, the smaller domestic refrigerators, which are dependent upon either gas or kerosene for their motive power, still use that technology. It is a technology that could be well and truly exported into China in large amounts to Australia's advantage if we were to substantially increase the manufacturing capability of that industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because the HFCs are not ozone-destroying but do represent a significant threat to the atmosphere, I would seek to change the title of the Bill, as Senator Baume suggested, to make it the Atmosphere Protection Act. That would open the door to many more reforms to protect the atmosphere from the enhanced greenhouse effect of this and other substances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats recognise the progress made by industry to phase out the CFCs. Obviously, it is not cheap for industry to wean itself off ozone depleting substances, particularly in refrigeration, but there are the substitutes which I have just mentioned. Mr Bob Worthington, who is the Chair of the Industrial Refrigeration Workshop, at a conference in Canberra just recently said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To date ammonia has been used mainly in large industrial refrigeration plant such as freezer stores, abattoirs and breweries. Ammonia systems can be used in almost all cooling applications including industrial cooling, air conditioning, supermarkets, etc.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ammonia is already part of everyday life as it is used in many household cleaners. It is a natural substance totally biodegradable, non carcinogenic, non ozone-depleting and contributes nothing to Greenhouse warming.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other advantages are that ammonia is low cost, made in Australia, the skills to use it are readily available in Australia, no new technical developments are required and its efficiency has been proved for over a century.</PARA>
<PARA>I stress that the energy requirements of an ammonia refrigerator are much less because the ability to transfer heat requires the transfer of less mass through the compressor system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The export of HCFCs and HFCs to developing countries is another pressing concern. I have already mentioned that China has 60 times our population. We must, if we are sane and sensible, make all reasonable efforts to prevent China from going down the CFC or the HFC road. We would be well advised to attempt to build an industry which could readily export ammonia based refrigerators into China. That would be of enormous benefit to the industry of this country and, of course, to future generations of Australians because of the potential damage that the large number of Chinese using refrigeration based on other systems could do the global atmosphere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The potential for HCFC use in the developing world is enormous. Therefore, it is imperative that industrialised countries develop technology and financial cooperation programs which promote ecologically sustainable development. We should be substantially increasing our foreign aid program and specifically directing it towards technology transfer in this area. Ozone protection policies in the north will be of limited value once developing countries start to rapidly escalate their use of ozone depleting substances simply because they cannot import cleaner and more expensive technologies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia can develop a cheaper and better technology and we should be doing it. We must put in place policies that prevent developing countries becoming dependent on the importation of HCFCs and HFCs. We must do this as much out of concern for social equity as out of concern for the environment. At the next review of the Montreal Protocol, the Australian delegation should propose that the 10-year delay for developing countries to phase out ozone depleting substances be brought forward by five years. This must, however, be done in conjunction with the provision of increased resources to developing countries and accelerated environmentally sound and socially just technology cooperation and transfer programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is vital that we adopt an ecologically sustainable development approach to the development of alternative technologies, that we do not continue to go up these blind alleys up which the Opposition, if Senator Baume is any indication, would take us. We must look beyond the limits of present international agreements, and identify and so avoid the several very expensive blind industrial alleys that now open before us and into which we may be led unless we take this longer view. We should base such an approach not on the narrow confines of ozone depletion in isolation but, rather, on a broad concern for protection of the global atmosphere. We have an opportunity to develop and export new industrial developments which would move Australia and the Third World together towards a greater level of sustainability. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Effectively, the Ozone Protection Amendment Bill is designed to update the Australian legislation with respect to ozone protection in accordance with the amendment to the Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer which was adopted by the parties to the protocol in London on 27-29 June 1990. The major aim of the amendment and, therefore, of the Bill, is to add substances which have been proven to be ozone depleting to the list of controlled substances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During debate in the House of Representatives, there was bipartisan agreement to the Bill. The honourable member for Pearce pointed to this fact during debate on this Bill in the other place on 28 April when he stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I think there is a lack of public understanding of the extent to which on major environmental issues there is bipartisan support for the action which is to be taken by government.</PARA>
<PARA>Regrettably, however, the Green position on it is that it may well be bipartisan willingness to not do enough with regard to the problem of ozone protection. This bipartisan agreement only serves to illustrate the fact that the major parties are not prepared to address the fundamental issues associated with such global environmental issues as ozone depletion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens' approach to ozone and to other environmental issues of this nature is to examine the fundamental causes of the problem and propose solutions that address these causes rather than treat the symptoms. Technological fixes that only address the symptoms will not solve the fundamental problems caused by the depletion of the ozone layer. A reappraisal of our lifestyle and its impact on the environment is required. These amendments merely detail technical aspects that allow us to agree with the legislation and, as has been pointed out, not fall behind in our commitment with other countries to move towards ozone protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole rationale behind air-conditioning is an example of how lifestyle reappraisal and its impact needs to be part of our thinking when we are addressing the problem of ozone depleting substances in our society. We need to question the rationale behind it. Why do we need air-conditioning? It is largely because the homes and buildings in which we live and work are not properly designed to withstand extremes of temperature. It is interesting to note that the Commonwealth Government has been researching in this area for many years and has published guidelines for buildings that are efficient in this regard, but there has been no legislation established to encourage builders and owners to follow the guidelines or to penalise those who design and build inefficient buildings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This leads to the related question of the greenhouse effect. Buildings that are badly designed and, therefore, require air-conditioning are, by definition, energy inefficient and consequently add to greenhouse problems. Also, if HFCs are used as replacements for CFCs and other ozone depleting substances, the greenhouse problem is potentially worsened because HFCs are a greenhouse gas. These facts point to the inherent interconnectedness of these sorts of issues and to the need for a broader policy perspective than the one we are discussing today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we solve the ozone problem but exacerbate the greenhouse effect we have effectively achieved nothing. The short term, reductionist and bandaid approach of both major parties is ineffective in approaching such fundamental and complex issues as ozone and greenhouse. The most appropriate analogy in this regard is to equate the ozone problem to that of a person with a heart problem. Given their track record in this regard, the major parties would advocate bypass surgery and drug treatment until the patient finally dies&mdash;a protraction of life, perhaps, with reduced quality. The Greens would advocate an approach which stresses the need for a fundamental reappraisal of the patient's lifestyle and the ultimate causes of the heart problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will cite three examples of involvement I have had with the community with regard to our ozone protection legislation. Firstly, I will cite Mr Aston of New South Wales who wrote to me and probably to many other people in this place imploring us to address three issues with great urgency. I agree with at least two of his issues and I can summarise the third. I quote from his letter to honourable senators as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing to you and your brethren, as, unlike everyone else in Australia, I care about what happens to my children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I read an article in Time Magazine of 17 February 1992 about how the ozone layer has been depleted to such an extent that it may be too late to repair the damage. It went on to say that an ozone hole may be about to appear over Europe and showed a recent satellite photo of a large `cloud' of chlorine over that Continent. Of course, this is additional to the existence of the Antarctic ozone hole, which gets closer to Australia every year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if that article is only partly accurate, the inhabitants of this planet are in a lot of trouble. I hope that I am not insulting your intelligence by saying that all life depends on the existence of the ozone layer. Plant life is particularly vulnerable to increased ultraviolet radiation. On the other hand, most people seem to think that the problem can be avoided by purchasing a pair of sunglasses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it rather amazing, therefore, that the Government continues to allow companies to manufacture and import CFC's. If politicians in this country had any conscience at all, CFC's would have been banned in 1974 when their full potential was realised or as soon as possible thereafter. The future of the world is at stake!</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Aston urges the immediate banning of CFCs, the banning of imports from countries that have not signed the Montreal Protocol and the exertion of very strong efforts to combat the existing problem. His solution is to exert pressure on the US Government. I might say that I have less faith in the US Government's concerns in this regard than he has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second example I wish to cite is a group of Western Australian individuals who are involved in all aspects of the air-conditioning industry, both manufacture and retail. These people have shown remarkable responsibility in gathering together to consider the impact of their industry upon the overall environment. They have made some suggestions which they are pursuing at State level, but they are suggestions which deserve our consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They point out that there is no licensing program for people who handle CFCs. Quite irrespective of the import and export regulations that are being dealt with here, the aspect of the handling of those CFCs that are already circulating within our community has been neglected. They recommend that education be provided to all people who are likely to be working in this area. They also point out that uniform licensing regimes and procedures do not exist throughout Australia. For example, there are none in Western Australia and varying standards apply in Victoria and New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A final suggestion which springs from their initiative is to ask why we are not looking at incentives for companies which responsibly take measures to recycle and handle with great care the CFCs that currently exist within our industry. These people are taking constructive steps to face the future of their industry, keeping in mind the benefits to all of us, as well as making sensible and responsible planning decisions for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third example is the work of the Australian Conservation Foundation and the very practical suggestions that are being made of the areas at which our legislation should be looking. There needs to be mandatory labelling of all goods which use ozone depleting substances in their manufacture. This involves electrical goods, furniture foams and whitegoods. Apparently, the USA is taking some initiatives in this regard and has legislation which, although moving very slowly, is moving in that direction and ahead of us. The second recommendation from the Australian Conservation Foundation is that the concept of essential use should be looked at, and we should ensure that ozone depleting substances are used only where ozone benign technology is not available. That goes alongside the encouragement to develop alternative technologies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the export of scheduled substances, the international perspective on this issue should also not be ignored. If the technology replacement approach to this problem is continued, it is likely that much of the old technology that has caused ozone depletion will be exported to Third World countries to maximise profits for multinational companies which have large stocks of equipment and consumables that have become unacceptable in industrialised countries. Developed countries such as Australia should be committing funds to develop alternative technologies that are inherently friendly to the environment and assisting in exporting that technology to Third World nations. As Senator Coulter mentioned, green technology transfer is an area where Australia has a very great potential to contribute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also aware that the Australian Conservation Foundation and other non-government organisations have recently written to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) concerning the ozone issue and the Government's response to the forthcoming meetings of the Montreal Protocol. There needs to be greater community input allowed and encouraged, and resources supplied for community members and non-government organisations to participate at all levels of the ozone debate, including the Montreal Protocol process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to facilitate a more fundamental reappraisal of the ozone problem and of the policy approaches suggested by the various community and business groups with an interest in this topic, I suggest that the Government gives serious and immediate consideration to some of the more fundamental solutions to this problem and encourages ways of community participation within it. Specifically, I would like to suggest that the Government investigate alternative technologies, designs or procedures that avoid altogether the need for ozone depleting substances and methods by which these alternatives could be implemented in the community. In addition, consideration should be given to the opportunities for Australian industry with respect to these alternative technologies and the best method by which government can encourage the manufacture and adoption of these technologies by industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opportunity exists for Australia to become a world leader in the field of alternative technologies and processes, with the attendant benefits to the nation's trade balance and the unemployment figures, as well as the state of the environment. The choice exists for us to continue to follow the herd or take the initiative on this important issue. I trust that the Government will support my suggestions and those of the Democrats in working towards effecting a sustainable future for this planet. I certainly support this Bill and, along with the Democrats, urge for a broadening of the approach to the problem. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;The Ozone Protection Amendment Bill 1992 is quite a complex scientific Bill. I have a very extensive knowledge of these particular matters, but I have always had the problem of trying to put them in terms that laymen like Senator Coulter would understand. I hope he bears with me during my response.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In general, on behalf of the Government I wish to thank the Senate for the general bipartisan support that this Bill has attracted. Australia has much to be proud of, having already phased out over 50 per cent of its use of CFCs since 1986. Much of this success has been due to our ability to focus clearly on ozone depletion and avoid confusion with other important, but separate, atmospheric protection issues. Hydrofluorocarbons are not ozone depleters. The Ozone Protection Amendment Bill is thus not an appropriate place for provisions on HFCs. To attempt to merge the two issues at this stage by broadening the ambit of the Bill may place at risk our ability to make continued gains in ozone protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An atmosphere protection Bill would bring with it the need to consider a very wide range of additional issues. Apart from any other factors, the mechanisms to protect the ozone layer are much further advanced than other atmospheric issues. Time delays in amending this Bill would prevent one of the principle objectives of the Bill, namely to allow Australia to ratify the 1990 Montreal Protocol before the meeting of the parties in November 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the principal issues in the amendments proposed by the Democrats, namely the control measures for hydrochlorofluorocarbons&mdash;HCFCs for short&mdash;is already being considered in the context of the renegotiation of the Montreal Protocol on substances which deplete the ozone layer. It is important that the measures taken by Australia are consistent with such international regimes. We will, of course, be putting into place whatever control measures for HCFCs are adopted under the Montreal Protocol following the November 1992 meeting of the parties which, in any event, will only be a short while after this Bill passes into domestic law. The provisions of this Bill already take into account Montreal Protocol requirements for reporting HCFC consumption. This will form a basis for the introduction in Australia of control mechanisms to meet Australia's obligations under the Montreal Protocol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to ensure that the detail of any control regime for HCFCs in Australia not only meets our international obligations for ozone protection but is also appropriate to the circumstances of Australian industry. The Government would wish to maintain the cooperative approach which has been so productive until now. This means that any control regime has to be developed in consultation with those affected, not simply imposed through legislation without prior consultation. I wish the Bill a speedy passage. </PARA>

I see the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) nodding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In moving these amendments, I simply point out that, in view of what the Minister has just said, nothing in these amendments makes the legislation inconsistent with our international agreements; they are simply to take the matter several steps further, recognising that almost certainly those steps will be taken very shortly. As already indicated, the HCFCs are likely to be brought under an umbrella in the meetings in November of the protocol nations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The essential point is that, in moving the amendments in the way that we are, we are seeking to close off as quickly as possible the use of those alternative substances, the technologies of which they form a part and the very substantial capital investments required if we go down that road. In that way, industry gets a very clear message as early as possible as to which way we need to go and, therefore, is encouraged to move into those alternative technological pathways which do not pose significant environmental damage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I stress&mdash;and I am pleased to have heard Senator Chamarette also make this point&mdash;that it places Australia in a very good position to help others, particularly Third World countries, so that they do not go down the very disastrous roads that they are virtually right on the edge of going down now. The sooner that a very clear signal is given to industry that HCFCs and HFCs are not a solution, the better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the one hand, HCFCs pose an ozone depleting potential, given the high probability that there will be a massive expansion in refrigeration use around the world in Third World countries.

Consequently, it is very sensible to send the strongest possible message to industry that those technologies are to be discouraged.

I gave an indication in summing up that some of the issues he has raised are being addressed by government, we expect with not too much delay, with the implementation of this Bill running into the Montreal meeting in November 1992. What we really have a discussion about here is not so much on the ends as the means to the ends. We are proposing a concentrated and focused view on this problem whereas Senator Coulter has suggested that further problems could be solved immediately. That is not the Government's view at this stage. It believes that it has to consult further with industry and that it would detract from the focus on this problem we are trying to solve. Therefore, we will not support the Australian Democrats' amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know there is a football match being shown on the television, but I think the issue about which I wish to speak this evening takes precedence over football. I will not detain the Senate for very long. This time last week we were debating a special motion to mark the commemoration of 25 years since the passing of the referendum recognising Aboriginal people in this country. Just seven days later, we have a landmark decision with the High Court ruling today that the traditional land rights of the Murray Island people in the Torres Strait have not been extinguished by the arrival of the British in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

The High Court has found that the common law of Australia recognises a form of native title which reflects the entitlements of indigenous inhabitants. However, the decision does not mean a recognition of land rights throughout Australia as the High Court decided that its declaration would affect only the Murray Island claim.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. As the Federal Government representative on the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, I make reference to this landmark decision. The High Court decision to recognise traditional land rights in the Murray Islands is a major legal and social landmark in Australian history. I believe that it will pave the way for much more comprehensive recognition of Australia's indigenous people. I recognise that lawyers and, indeed, politicians will continue to scrutinise and evaluate the legal consequences of the High Court decision. The immediate effect of the decision will change Australian attitudes to indigenous people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until today, the law has upheld the principle of terra nullius; that is, that Australia was an empty, uninhabited land in 1788. But the High Court has now found that Australia's common law recognises a form of native title which, in the cases where it has not been extinguished, reflects the entitlement of the indigenous inhabitants in accordance with their land or customs to their traditional lands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is important that the community keeps a perspective on the decision which recognises the rights of the indigenous people of the Murray Islands, whose occupation of the land has been continuous since British colonisation. I hope that we will not have scare campaigns, especially from members of parliament, because we have agreed to reconciliation. I hope that the media reports this case in the context in which it has been announced by the High Court and gives clear recognition to the fact that there are particular circumstances, particular reasons&mdash;historical and legal&mdash;for this case. I hope there will not be screaming headlines around Australia about land grabs. This is not a question of a land grab; it is a question of recognition of native title. The Murray Island people have had continuous occupation and association with their land. This has been upheld today in Australia; it has been upheld on previous occasions in the United States and in Canada. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the experience of the United States and Canada, it is likely that there will be claims from traditional communities, but I would emphasise that those claims will come from remote parts of the country. It is essential that both Federal and State governments closely examine the overseas precedents in the settlement of those claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Eddie Mabo, his family and his community who have argued so persuasively for over 10 years to gain recognition of indigenous rights to native title to their traditional lands. It is a tragedy that Eddie Mabo died of cancer earlier this year and cannot celebrate his victory. His family can certainly celebrate the fact that his name will be significant from this day onwards in Australian history because this is a landmark case for Australia's indigenous people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final issue that I would like to make reference to is that from this day, schoolchildren can no longer be educated about Australia as being an empty land, as the archaeological and historical facts of Australia's indigenous people have finally been recognised, not just as they have been for many years by numerous people in the community, but finally within the law and from the highest court in the land. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise briefly this evening to bring to the attention of the Senate a very interesting article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 2 June 1992. It is headed `Vic Offers Landmark Settlement to Farmers' and states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Victorian Government has offered a $1.75 million settlement to 51 potato farmers who claimed their land became contaminated with the chemical dieldrin, lawyers representing the farmers said yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA>It is a very interesting article. The pesticide in beef fiasco was current at about the time I was elected to the Senate. At that stage there was quite a debate. In Western Australia alone 35 farms were affected by the over application of heptachlor and dieldrin by the State Energy Commission of Western Australia. Some were also contaminated by the actions of Telecom. A lot of farms were contaminated by farmers themselves who applied dieldrin on the advice of the Department of Agriculture of Western Australia. The same applied in South Australia, although minimally, and Victoria, as this article points out. Some farms in New South Wales were affected as were some in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These chemicals caused the pesticide in beef problem when our beef exports to the United States were cut off for some time. It took a long time to rectify and caused a lot of headaches for farmers who were not able to sell the stock that they had ready to turn off. Compulsory levies were brought in by different States to try to get over the problem. Nowhere along the line did the State governments, through the departments of agriculture which gave the go ahead for those chemicals to be used, pick up the responsibility. As well as the farms that I mentioned which were contaminated by Telecom and the SEC, there were scores of others where farmers used chemicals because they thought they were doing the right thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That problem goes back to 1987. I mentioned it briefly in my maiden speech. There was a further debate in December 1987 when the Senate finally decided to hold an inquiry into the use of agricultural chemicals in Australia. A lot of its recommendations have been put into place. There was no reference in that inquiry to compensation for these farmers who were badly hit by actions that were not of their own making. I am sure that the Government would not look at the question of compensation. We pleaded with the Democrats at the time. They continually refused us, so that reference to compensation was left out. These farmers in Victoria have battled for five years to get justice and they have some sort of justice as a result of that court decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I encourage the rest of the farmers of Australia who were affected to take up their cause. I point out to the State governments and their departments of agriculture which cleared these chemicals that had a built-up, adverse effect on the land: that effect is still there now. That land has been used for growing crops that are cut and taken off, rather than grazing stock. With this court action I certainly hope that all the departments of agriculture throughout Australia recognise their mistake, and encourage their governments to put these farmers right and award them the compensation that they should have had at that time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I draw the attention of the Senate to a longstanding and outrageous abuse of human rights. In any circumstances the story I am about to tell would cause anger and concern. This situation is perhaps even worse because the perpetrator of this particular abuse is a government body using an Act of this Parliament to justify its behaviour.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will have to describe the citizen concerned as Mr Y because this saga is unfortunately not yet over. This person is an employee of Australia Post. During a long career with Australia Post he became aware of a number of activities regarding the awarding of contracts within his section. In his opinion, those contracts were not efficient and perhaps were even illegal. He reported these things and subsequently found himself under siege in his workplace. He was constantly reprimanded, passed over for promotion and made the subject of an ongoing campaign of verbal abuse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He complained. The internal complaints procedures took over two years. In the meantime, Mr Y was forced to remain in an openly hostile environment, subject to the very people that he had complained about. He also felt the people were taking bribes and fixing tenders, in his words. They kept him advised about how well his appeal against them was going. He lost his appeal. He then suffered a complete physical and emotional collapse&mdash;what is commonly called a nervous breakdown. I am not surprised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since then he has been unable to go out alone or to be alone for long periods. He is easily distressed and when distressed he cannot even perform the simplest of tasks, such as remembering a phone number or making a telephone call. He finds most social interactions almost impossible and most physical activity difficult; he suffers from incontinence and is constantly on medication to ease his severe depression. He is a married man with children still at home, and this has been his life for the last eight years. Mr Y has been receiving a Comcare benefit for that time. It is the opinion of all the doctors and specialists who have examined him during those eight years that he will never be fit to work at Australia Post again. I have introduced this by way of background. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This story is not about what happened 10 or so years ago that led to the ruination of this man's life; it is about what Australia Post is presently doing to further damage this man, to make his life as miserable as possible and perhaps even lead to his death. Australia Post is using the Comcare legislation put in place by this Government. The Australian Democrats supported the legislation when it was before the Parliament because we believed strongly in the provision of fair and efficient rehabilitation and compensation for all Australian workers. We believe that the Government, as an employer, has a duty of care to lead the way in the provision of workers compensation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time, however, we expressed our concern about Australia Post and Telecom being allowed to administer the Act for their own employees. We have continued to express our concern as more and more cases of harshness, discrimination, misconduct and harassment come to light. Australia Post and Telecom have used their new arrangements under Comcare to clear the books of long term claimants. They have consistently misused the monitoring provisions of the Act to justify phone tapping, surveillance by private detectives, the secret video taping of medical consultations and constant doctor shopping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In one case reported to my office recently, a woman in Perth was sent to 50 separate medical appointments as part of her annual review. In theory, once these abuses had come to light it should have been a simple matter to stop them. But no, Comcare and the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) claim they have no authority to intervene. So the self-administrators, Australia Post and Telecom, go on their merry way failing to offer adequate rehabilitation programs, subjecting claimants to constant harassment, reinterpreting the Act to suit their financial agendas and denying people the compensation to which they are entitled and which they would get if they worked in any other part of the public sector. I stress that this is not so much a complaint about Comcare as about the self-administration by Australia Post and Telecom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My office has been attempting to assist for some time now with some small success in the case of Mr Y, despite the aggressiveness and lack of cooperation by Australia Post in Western Australia, particularly its self-appointed vigilante, Mr Lippiat, and Australia Post's solicitors, Greenland Brooksby. I am a little at a loss for words because this has been occupying my office for some time and I am only just containing my anger about this. One would hope for the sake of the other clients of the solicitors that it too is being misled by Australia Post's delegate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each time someone intervenes to help, however, Mr Y is subjected to a further round of vicious harassment in the form of hostile letters and more doctors' appointments. I have already described his anxieties about venturing out and certainly going on his own. His review has been going on for some 18 months and has involved a minimum of three different doctors examining him each two months interspersed with threatening and accusatory letters. As of today, the campaign has extended to include Mr Y's attending psychiatrist. Australia Post appears to have decided that all of its long term compensation claimants and their doctors are crooks and cheats and treats them accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Y's condition has deteriorated dramatically under this siege of officious ill will, as we can imagine would happen. Any reasonable person would assess immediately that such activity would cause his condition to deteriorate. He has been close to suicide on two occasions this year. His treating physician has twice called personally to my office to express his alarm and to ask for help. After the first of these calls I asked the Minister to intervene directly. The Minister's response was to appoint a senior officer from Comcare to oversee the case. Despite the diligence and competence of this officer, the harassment of Mr Y continues. It continues not because of the intervention of the officer but despite it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even despite the Minister's intervention, Australia Post continues to deal with Mr Y just as it always has done. Despite evidence of obvious bias and mishandling, the same case supervisor is still dealing with the case and the same chain of command remains intact. All that has changed is that Australia Post now has one more person in the chain to lie to while pursuing Mr Y to his grave. They have denied Mr Y access to his own files and have failed on at least three occasions to answer questions and provide material to the Commonwealth Ombudsman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Y's mental and physical condition continues to deteriorate as he remains under pressure. In fact, Australia Post has taken to suspending his benefit in anticipation of his not meeting its ever-increasing demands to attend extra medical appointments while it tries to prove that this man, who is not capable of holding a conversation without shaking, crying and becoming totally disoriented, is secretly holding down a job as a language tutor. So long as in the end it can stop his pension permanently, Australia Post does not seem to care at all whether it has to withhold and falsify documents, lie, distort and harass or even drive a man to take his own life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I indicated a few moments ago, Mr Y's benefit was wrongfully suspended. Australia Post lied to Comcare's representative and to a member of my staff regarding the reinstatement of Mr Y's benefit, claiming there would be no suspension of his benefit. This was three weeks ago. Today, Mr Y rang my office in severe distress to inform me that he had not been paid and that he would not be reinstated because he and his doctor were `not being cooperative'. It took the threat of me making this speech and further action before the Human Rights Commission before Australia Post grudgingly reinstated the benefit today that it has wrongfully withheld from Mr Y for over a fortnight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Y's case is one of about 100 cases of improper behaviour by Australia Post and Telecom as self-administrators of the Comcare Act. The Democrats have brought this pattern of consistent abuse to the attention of the Minister and the executive management of Comcare. We have done that on a number of occasions. The Government has introduced legislation covering new administrative arrangements under which Australia Post and Telecom, now known as AOTC, will have to hold a licence to administer the Act. This will, so the Minister claims, give Comcare the power to intervene and take disciplinary action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even in the most cynical, economically pragmatic analysis, it does not make sense to allow enterprises which have spent their budgetary allocation for workers compensation for the last four years on private detectives and extravagant numbers of expert medical opinions. It is a nonsense to say that such an enterprise should be allowed to spend its budget in that way and claim that it is spending it wisely and to the benefit of the employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cases such as the one I have brought to the Senate today, and the hundred or so other cases that have been brought to me, lead me to conclude that Australia Post and Telecom have proved themselves to be totally unsuitable to hold a licence, even if we could be sure that the new arrangements would mean tighter control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will be cold comfort to Mr Y and others like him, the majority of whom live in Minister Cook's own State of Western Australia, to license the abuses that Telecom and Australia Post now perpetrate. As victims of such grievous assault upon their rights as workers and human beings, it will be difficult to convince them that the proposed system will work or that justice denied them will not be denied others and that they will be offered some means of redress and compensation. It is very difficult to imagine, given the history that we have had presented to us&mdash;of which my story tonight is only a small part&mdash;that we can assume Australia Post and Telecom are capable of demonstrating a better attitude with these slight changes that are proposed in forthcoming legislation. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AIR TRAFFIC SERVICES CENTRES, BRISBANE AND MELBOURNE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wish to make a short statement to the House regarding the Public Works Committee's inquiry into the proposal by the Civil Aviation Authority to construct Air Traffic Services Centres at Brisbane and Melbourne. This project was referred to the Committee by the House on 26 February 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Speaker as I made clear at the Committee's first public hearing on 8 April the role of the Committee is to examine and report to the Parliament on the building works involved with the Australian Advanced Air Traffic System project (TAAATS). The main component of the TAAATS project is the consolidation of the five major air traffic control centres to two centres&mdash;Brisbane and Melbourne. The cost estimate of the building works when referred to the Committee was $50m.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am sure that honourable members are aware that there has been considerable controversy regarding the CAA's decision to name Thomson Radar as the preferred contractor for TAAATS. The CAA has also announced that the Hughes Aircraft Company is the alternative contractor.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the Committee has attempted to stay clear of issues relating to the TAAATS equipment contract it has proved to be impossible. In fact I stressed at the beginning of the inquiry that the Committee did not wish to involve itself in issues relating to the TAAATS equipment contract. The Committee's task has been made difficult due to the turnkey nature of the contract for the TAAATS project. Under the turnkey contract the successful contractor will also be responsible for the provision of the building works. This has presented the Committee with a situation where very few details of the building works have been available to it. However this is a matter on which the Committee will comment in detail in its report which will be tabled in the budget session.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is true that the principal role of the Public Works Committee is to satisfy itself of the need for public works. However section 17 subsection 1b of the Public Works Committee Act while empowering the Committee to make a report to both Houses of the Parliament concerning the expedience of carrying out a public work also provides that the Committee may report to the Parliament concerning any other matters related to the work in respect of which the Committee thinks it desirable that the view of the Committee should be reported to the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite arguments put by the CAA and an impertinent letter from the Chairman of the CAA Mr Butcher my Committee did not exceed its mandate. It is surprising that key officials of the CAA and key witnesses before a Parliamentary Committee did not bother to familiarise themselves with the role and duty of the Public Works Committee. My Committee found the comments by Mr Butcher impertinent and insulting as he attempted to lecture the Committee on its role&mdash;the members of the Public Works Committee are well aware of their role and duty and do not need to be to lectured by bureaucrats.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee was also frustrated in the exercise of its duty by the unwillingness or inability of key CAA witnesses to answer relevant questions. Reluctantly the Committee conducted two in-camera hearings but even with this protection the CAA witnesses were still unwilling or unable to answer key questions.

Basically, Mr Hollis and the Public Works Committee have recommended that the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Cook) immediately appoint a tribunal, in their words, `to inquire into the awarding of the TAAATs contract to Thomson CSF'. Amongst the matters which they have raised as issues of concern are whether the Thomson equipment is the best available; whether the selection process conducted by the CAA was `doctored' to favour the Thomson bid; and why the preference of the technical and operational evaluation teams for Hughes was overturned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a matter which has been raised by me and a number of my colleagues on both sides of the chamber for some considerable time. The recommendations of the Public Works Committee only go to prove that our concerns are very real and well held. I think, Mr Deputy President, both you and Senator Reynolds, whom I acknowledge is in the chamber, also have similar concerns about this matter and were willing to give up your time on an up evening to attend a very long and detailed briefing with the CAA. There are matters that have arisen as a result of that that are not satisfactory; I think that is generally agreed on all sides. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is, on the Order of Business paper, a motion to refer this matter to a Senate committee. Whether that will be necessary will now depend on the actions of the Minister. I hope that the Minister will, as a matter of urgency, follow the recommendations of the Public Works Committee. This matter really needs to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I would just flag one thing to the Senate at this time: it must be a proper wide-ranging inquiry with the power to force production of evidence. Moreover, the evidence presented to that inquiry must attract the same privilege that would be attracted by evidence presented before a Senate inquiry. Matters have been raised with me by various people. Because they are so afraid of the consequences of saying the things that they know or feel to be true, they will not present this evidence unless they receive privilege. I think if this matter is to be properly investigated, all persons appearing before it and all evidence must attract privilege&mdash;even if it requires that certain of the proceedings of this investigation or tribunal be in camera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very clearly the case that something has arguably gone seriously wrong. The Public Works Committee was mortified by the conduct of some of the officers who appeared before it. I do not believe, on examination of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, that their conduct was satisfactory. Mr Hollis indicated that it was not. In fact, he described the Chairman of the CAA as `impertinent'. I do note that the Chairman of the Committee says that the recommendation that this inquiry be set up is unprecedented. That is the magnitude of the problem. It is evidence that the things that many of us in this chamber have been saying for quite a while are well founded. It is now up to the Government to show its good faith and to act properly to set up the inquiry in the terms which I have recommended. </PARA>

The tests were conducted by the Division of Entomology, Canberra. The results are given in two Divisional reports by M Lenz and S Runko, Report No. 90/11 October 1990 and Report No. 91/15 August 1991. The results of tests on both reports were generally satisfactory in that termites did not breach the mesh except in one instance where one species of termite with a head width of 0.76mm passed through the mesh. The openings of the mesh were reduced to 0.67x0.45mm to prevent this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The CSIRO Division of Building, Construction and Engineering (DBCE) is of the view that further appraisal is required before Termimesh can be considered to be sufficiently developed for national application to new construction. This is being conducted by a DBCE Officer through Australian Building Systems Appraisal Council (ABSAC) and concerns physical properties, durability and installation procedures with particular reference to Australian Standard AS2057-1986 `Protection of Buildings from Subterranean Termites'. Following this work details of optimum installation have been developed with the manufacturer, reports of corrosion tests received and inspections made of trial installations. Following ABSAC advice, a training program for franchised installers is being adopted. Comments from State regional committees are being obtained in relation to State requirements under the Building Code of Australia before issuing an appraisal document. A satisfactory appraisal generally ensures approval by local government building surveyors for use in construction.</PARA>
