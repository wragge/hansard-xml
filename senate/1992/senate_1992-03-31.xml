<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Defence. I ask: has the Government made any estimate of the number of casualties likely to be suffered by Australian peacekeepers in the course of their deployment in Cambodia? If so, what percentage figure has been assessed, and was any assessment made prior to the current escalation of fighting in Cambodia?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Department of Defence has made no such estimate as Senator Durack suggests. But what we have quite clearly done, and I think I have put it on the record before, is list the potential dangers that any Australian service men and women would face in Cambodia. Probably the number one danger is in the hygiene area. There are numerous strands of disease, unfortunately, in that country at the moment. One of the main reasons why the UN and Australia favour the military option is the discipline usually shown by troops in looking after their own hygiene and their surrounds. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is always a danger, in a country such as Cambodia, of mines. No-one knows how many millions of mines there are in Cambodia. It is absolutely essential that the corporate knowledge that remains in Cambodia can be passed on by the various factions so de-mining operations can occur. There will always be a potential danger from warring factions within Cambodia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, as Senator Evans explained to Senator Durack yesterday, this is a peacekeeping, not a peace enforcement, operation. We do not expect this operation to unduly place any of the UN participants in danger. That cannot be guaranteed, but it would be pointless at this stage to do the exercise of estimating the number of casualties, as Senator Durack may be suggesting we do. We are anticipating no casualties. We are hoping for no casualties, but we can give no guarantee that there will not be some casualties.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Administrative Services. Is the Minister aware of proposals to contract out and privatise services currently provided by the Department of Administrative Services? Can the Minister indicate whether there are savings to be made to revenue through such proposals?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1367" SPEAKER="Bolkus Sen The Hon N." NAMEID="XE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen recent proposals to contract out, as well as to privatise, functions of the Department of Administrative Services. They were part of the Opposition's consumption tax package and they were released last November.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since that time, I have been sitting back here waiting for questions from the Opposition in respect of those proposals. I thought that Senator Parer, at least, would have liked to pursue the case. But I have had no questions, and it is quite apparent why not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The savings estimated by the Opposition in this area are wrong on three grounds, and they are wrong to the tune of $500m over the first three years of the package. There are anticipated savings of $540m&mdash;$500m wrong. There is a $500m black hole in the GST package. It is a discrepancy caused by incompetence, lack of understanding and a basic inability to count. The Opposition policies in this area are based on the work of a Professor Domberger. Domberger states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the introduction of competition, rather than awarding contracts to private firms, which is the critical cost-saving factor.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition uses this principle and decides not to contract out, but to privatise functions. It says that privatising is the only way. The Opposition is working on the wrong premise. It is competition that leads to savings, not the act of privatising. The Opposition has misapplied Domberger's findings, but that is not the full extent of its blunder. Its analysis ignores one basic development. Since 1987, the Government has radically restructured the Department of Administrative Services. As Domberger says, it is competition that leads to savings. We have introduced competition. We have had it for at least four years. Fifty per cent of the functions of Administrative Services are now untied and, through decisions already taken, by the next financial year 90 per cent of value-added of the Department of Administrative Services will be untied and open to competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have already achieved the savings. We are already saving $200m per annum; productivity has been increasing at 5 per cent since 1987. So it is no wonder that the Department of Finance could not support the Opposition's calculations. It is no wonder that it could find only $35m worth of savings in this area as opposed to the Opposition's anticipated savings of $540m.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only has the Opposition got it wrong twice; it has got it wrong three times, and there is a doozey involved in this. The Opposition got its details wrong. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>Without going into all of them, let me instance just one to show the Senate and the Australian people the extent of the incompetence in this area. In the consumption tax package, the Opposition has made the claim that through contracting out the services of the Overseas Property Group there will be savings of $20m per annum. This shows amazing ineptitude. The OPG has a budget of $130m for 1991-92, so the Opposition assumes that 20 per cent of that is close to $20m and that it can realise that sort of saving through contracting out the functions&mdash;and that is what the Opposition has whacked into its document.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But OPG's running costs are only $3m out of $130m. The rest of it is already contracted out to the private sector; it includes rents, construction fit-outs and so on. All but $3m of OPG's budget is already contracted out. So we have this fantastic claim that, out of a budget of $3m, it can save $20m. It is embarrassingly wrong for the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been no homework. There has been no application to the task, no attempt to understand the programs it plans to contract out, just an inept application of ideology with no serious policy work. Its opposition to DAS illustrates the general approach in the Fightback package. It is a lazy retreat to ideology&mdash;unsupported assertions, rather than hard policy work.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already stated in Question Time this week for Senator O'Chee's benefit&mdash;and it was lost on him because he is obviously not interested in the truth of this issue&mdash;that on investigation it was discovered that the problem with the F28 was a faulty radar transponder on board the aircraft, and it had nothing whatever to do with the system itself. Despite that, the CAA is double checking the system, as it always does, by running actual test flights at Cairns to ensure that the problem was, in fact, with the transponder and not with the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that software problems are a feature of any air traffic control system in the world. All air traffic controllers in the world, including Australian air traffic controllers, are trained to deal with those eventualities efficiently.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am familiar with reports to which Senator Maguire refers. The most dramatic of them, I guess, was the testimony of the Director of the CIA, Robert Gates, before the United States Senate last month. I need hardly say that this is an issue which my Department and the intelligence community in this country have been following extremely closely for some time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been very deeply concerned by the evidence of substantial, unsafeguarded nuclear facilities in North Korea which could, indeed, be intended for a nuclear weapons program. Assessments vary as to how long it would take North Korea to become a nuclear weapons state, if that is indeed the country's intention. But a worse case scenario, which Mr Gates, for example, was outlining, is one which could have North Korea a nuclear weapons state within a very short space of time&mdash;indeed, a matter of months rather than years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would, of course, regard such a development as fundamentally destabilising in the Asia-Pacific region and, indeed, as the most serious security threat in our region. Our judgment is shared by nearly all of our friends and allies, with whom we have been making vigorous attempts to persuade the DPRK not to pursue such a course. Our concerns have been put very directly and in strong terms to DPRK Ministers and officials. We have worked very hard with others such as Japan and the US to register this message. We have also impressed on countries which have close links with the DPRK, such as China, the dramatic security implications of such a development. It is in fact the case that all major powers in the region, including China, Russia and Japan, have made clear that they are opposed to a North Korean nuclear weapons capability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it has been generally acknowledged that Australia has been very active on this issue, indeed at the forefront of efforts within the International Atomic Energy Agency, to have the DPRK ratify and implement the safeguards agreement that it signed on 30 January this year, as required by its accession back in 1985 to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Implementation of that would bring with it IAEA inspections, which are essential to the verification of North Korea's intentions with its nuclear program. The DPRK's signature of a safeguards agreement and its bilateral agreements with South Korea have been very welcome signs of progress on the Korean Peninsula generally. But we, I have to say, are very far from confident of the DPRK's intentions on unconditional implementation, particularly in view of the country's past record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this further opportunity, in the strongest possible terms, to urge North Korea to quickly allow International Atomic Energy Agency inspections and to therefore allay the concerns which are very widespread in the international community about its nuclear intentions. If the international community cannot be reassured in this way, we will be faced with a very serious situation indeed in which further measures will need to be considered. For obvious reasons, I do not want to canvass what those measures might be&mdash;that will be a matter for the international community as a whole.

The matter that has been referred is that the minimum size, as prescribed in our legislation, for a federally registered union in Australia should be 10,000.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The recent reports of fighting in and around the UN protected areas in Croatia are of serious concern in the context of the impending full deployment of UNPROFOR, or UN Protection Force, expected this coming month, in April. There have already been several exchanges of artillery fire which have landed near UNPROFOR personnel. There are clearly grounds for concern that the current escalation of violent incidents in Croatia could lead to a breakdown of the cease-fire that has generally held since early this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against this background the force commander, Lieutenant-General Satish Nambiar, has issued an urgent appeal to the authorities in Belgrade and Zagreb to take all necessary measures to end the cease-fire violations. He added that the continuing violations `needlessly prolonged' the suffering of the civilian population and could delay the full deployment of the force. There is also an obvious danger that fighting will intensify in the neighbouring republic of Bosnia-Herzegovinia where delicate negotiations on that republic's future are now under way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia, along with the rest of the international community, is insisting that the parties to the conflict, including the Yugoslav Army, act in a moderate and rational manner to enable all the issues to be resolved peacefully. The international community has put in place the necessary structures in the form of UNPROFOR and the European Community's peace conference, chaired by Lord Carrington, to allow for the peace to be kept and for a political solution to be found. We as a government have strongly supported a UN role in Yugoslavia, and we do urge all the parties involved to abide by the cease-fire arrangements so that the deployment of UNPROFOR can continue on track.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also recognise that the safety of UN personnel in Yugoslavia is the responsibility of the force commander, as elsewhere with peace keeping operations, and the decision on how quickly he can deploy the full force will depend on his assessment of the situation on the ground.

What in fact is the case is that the actions of the Northern Territory Government are absolutely contradictory to the advice it is receiving under its own legislation from its own Sacred Sites Protection Authority.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is sadly needed and badly needed in this whole debate about the important question of flood mitigation for Alice Springs&mdash;and it is important&mdash;is that all of the parties to this debate cool off. It does not assist the debate in a rational way for the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory to issue public statements saying that not only will the dam proceed, but that the Northern Territory Government's gaols are big enough to gaol anybody who tries to stop it. The debate is not helped by Northern Territory Government Ministers swapping abuse with people at public meetings in Alice Springs and telling Aboriginal people to get off their bums and solve their grog problems.

The basic issues in that article were canvassed by me at the start of Question Time today. The first part of the answer to Senator Parer and the Senate is that for some four years now the Department of Administrative Services has had a continuing program of commercialisation of the operation of that organisation. As I said at the start of Question Time, something like 50 per cent value added of Administrative Services business is now open to competition. By the next financial year that figure will increase to 90 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of that process, there has been a program of redundancies and people have been paid out of the service. A number of times during the course of the last 15 months, the Opposition has raised this issue of redundancies and complained about the fact that that is an ongoing process. Putting that aside, there is a program of redundancies and the program for the next financial year will be settled during the Budget process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures in the Opposition's proposals in this area have been assessed by both my Department and the Department of Finance. There is one thing that is very clear about those figures: they show an enormous hole in the Opposition's GST package. The Opposition has budgeted something like $100m for redundancies across the public sector. In this Department alone, on the most conservative figure given by the Department of Finance, it is at least $219m. However, if one were to take the Opposition's approach and analyse it fully and comprehensively, one would find that those figures probably do not reflect the situation adequately. We would find that the cost of redundancies, including superannuation, of all those people who would have to be laid off in the Department of Administrative Services over the Opposition's three-year program would amount to something like $1.1 billion or $1.2 billion. The value of the assets that have been talked about in terms of being sold, contracted out or privatised is somewhere near $450m alone. Those are the assets that the Opposition wants to sell and commercialise totally. There is a gap of some $830m.</PARA>

With other calls between now and the end of May, there would have been insufficient funds in AMF to meet the totality of expenditures required across the board, without seeking to significantly accelerate the processes for the passage of Appropriation Bill (No. 3).

I obtained an answer from the Minister for Finance which I seek leave to have incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a question without notice on 26th March concerning the performance of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme Senator Reid asked me. . . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"Why is it that the effective annual rate of interest paid on contributions to the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme through the Retirement Benefits Office during 1990-91 was only 2.84 per cent? How does the Government explain such a poor return, given that most large superannuation funds outside the Government earned between 9 and 18 per cent over the same period?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I undertook to consult the Minister for Finance who has provided the following response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Responsibility for the investment Commonwealth Superannuation Fund lies, of course, not with the Minister for Finance or the Retirement Benefits Office, but with the Board of Trustees of the Fund. However, this is not the first occasion that the question of the Fund's 1990-91 results has been raised and I am informed that the following is the form of the response provided by the Board in respect of similar queries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"Clearly the recent performance of the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund has been disappointing but on the more positive side the returns achieved by the Fund for the first two quarters of this current financial year have been strongly positive with annualised fund earning rates of 9.6% and 13.9% being achieved for the September and December quarters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When considering the performance of a Superannuation Fund it is important to recognise that superannuation is a long term investment. Therefore, the primary objective is to maximise the expected rate of returns over long term while investing safely. It can sometimes be very difficult to achieve this objective and at the same time maintain acceptable short term returns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an effort to achieve these objectives a balanced approach to investment of the Fund is being pursued. Under this approach the Fund is invested in most major investment sectors such as shares, property, fixed interest etc. This approach has earned relatively good returns for Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme (CSS) contributors in the long term. Indeed for the 5 years to 30 June 1991 the Fund's interest allocation rate has averaged 11.03 per cent per annum notwithstanding the stockmarket crash in October 1987 and the disappointing returns achieved in 1990/91.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the commencement of the 1990-91 financial year over 35% of the Fund's assets were held in property. This had reduced to 29.9% by the end of the calendar year. The scheme's funds manager (Commonwealth Funds Management Limited&mdash;CFM) has reported that the disappointing performance for 1990-91 was caused by the significant downturn in the property sector and, to a lesser extent, by poor returns from the international equities sector. As you will be aware, the property sector particularly hard hit by the recession and, coupled with the Fund's relatively high exposure, was the major factor contributing to the disappointing result over all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To make valid comparisons with the 1990-91 performance of other large funds, it would be necessary to focus on their exposure to the public sector. In this regard other large funds with significant property exposures experienced similarly disappointing results in 1990-91.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Property is by its nature an illiquid asset class and the current property market in Australia is very depressed. Nonetheless, every reasonable effort is being made to reduce the Fund's exposure to property through orderly sales at satisfactory prices. In this regard it is recognised that it would not be in the long term best interests of scheme members to conduct a "fire sale" simply to reduce exposure. Consequently, guidelines for property sales have been set which concentrate on the prospective returns which can be expected from particular properties as opposed to returns which have been achieved in the past. In addition the current overweighted exposure to property can be expected to be diluted to some extent by growth in the size of the fund contributions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since assuming responsibilities for the management and investment of the Fund on 1 July 1990 the new Board of Trustees has been actively involved, in consultation with an independent firm of investment advisers, in the development of a revised long term investment strategy for the Fund. That strategy will concentrate on the unique nature of the CSS Fund and the underlying nature of the liabilities it supports and will also address strategies for reducing the current negative impact of the property portfolio of overall fund performance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Details of this new strategy will be distributed by the Board to all members once the consultation process with relevant employer and union groups has been completed.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Button&mdash;On 24 March <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Hansard</EMPHASIS>, page 918) Senator Hill asked me as the Leader of the Government in the Senate a question without notice about the Government's intentions to improve the skills and career prospects for young Australians through the reform of entry-level training and youth wages. He also asked what the Government means by `youth wages'. I undertook to obtain an answer for Senator Hill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, youth wages generally comprise award payments to persons under 21 years of age who are paid either junior rates, apprenticeship rates or Australian Traineeship System rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of youth wages and their relationship to the present system of entry-level training, largely involving apprenticeships and traineeships, is one of the issues addressed in a recent report presented to the Government by the Employment and Skills Formation Council chaired by Mr Laurie Carmichael. This report is in response to the Government's concern about the present system's ability to deliver the quantity and quality of vocational education and training necessary for a highly skilled Australian work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Council proposes an Australian Vocational Certificate Training System involving a move from time-serving to competency-based training and greater delivery flexibility. Industry would be expected to substantially increase its number of work-based training places, including sectors which currently have no entry-level training arrangements. Commonwealth subsidies to employers for work-based training are recommended to continue until the 1993-94 Budget, and then extended to all industry sectors, at a lower rate per trainee. In relation to wages for trainees, the Council believes these are best determined by the industrial parties and recommends that they be based on competencies and time spent in productive work, unlike present age related time served arrangements. Where youth wages fall below the Government's standard allowance rate for 18 year old independent persons, the Council proposes a "top up" allowance to be paid by the Commonwealth, but separate from AUSTUDY.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is committed to reforming entry-level training arrangements and is preparing a response to the report.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday Senator Brownhill asked me a question concerning the cost of meat inspection and surplus meat inspectors. I have a long answer here which details the specific questions he asked. I seek leave to incorporate the answer in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The answer read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In response to Senator Brownhill's question of 30 March relating to administrative costs of meat inspection and surplus meat inspectors, I can confirm that the Australian Quarantine and Inspection (AQIS) did in fact, identify 63 inspectors at closed headquarters in February 1991, but since that date, through relocation to vacancies, natural attrition and voluntary redundancy, this number has been reduced to 41. As a result of this Government funded voluntary redundancy program for meat inspectors, the number of 1654 stated by Senator Brownhill has been reduced to 1535 as at 31 March 1992 and further reductions are expected before the end of the financial year through further offers of voluntary redundancy. Overall inspection numbers have been reduced by some 373 through a planned program of voluntary redundancy since 1989 with approval for a further 170 by the end of this financial year. With particular regard to overheadquartered staff, the Food Standards Officer Award Restructuring package endorsed by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in October 1991 provides for a wide range of measures to be put in place which greatly increases flexibility in the conditions for the provision of meat inspection to abattoirs and will enable a more rapid response to reheadquartering inspectors to where they are required. This in effect means that ultimately, there will be no inspection staff remaining at locations where abattoirs have closed. I would like to point out that whilst there have been a number of meat inspectors stationed at closed headquarters, they have in fact, continued to be productively utilised as relief pool inspectors at other abattoirs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me now turn to action taken by the Government to reduce the administrative costs of AQIS. In December 1990, the Minister for Resources engaged the services of management consultants Ernst and Young to review and report on the organisational form and management of AQIS. As a result of this and other intensive reviews of AQIS, in November 1991 the Minister for Resources announced a package of significant reforms, the major thrust of which was to make AQIS more business-like. Since the announcement of the package, AQIS Central Office realised immediate staff savings of 22 with a further 12-15 expected through voluntary redundancy before the end of the 1991/92 financial year. In addition to Central Office savings, the Regional Offices have also undergone reviews since 1990 which saw the closure of the Northern Territory and Tasmanian Regional offices with savings of two and ten respectively and savings of up to a total of 40 across other Regional Offices, and these reviews are still continuing. In addition, AQIS will be assisted in its endeavour to become a more commercially oriented enterprise by adopting commercial accounting procedures and the establishment of a Group 2 Trust Account on 1 July 1993 into which cost recovery revenues will be paid and from which expenditure will be funded. On July 1 1993 AQIS, will be entirely self funding in its program delivery.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Aulich on 31 March 1992 relating to the Department of Administrative Services.</PARA>
<PARA>In answer to a question asked by Senator Aulich, Senator Bolkus referred to an alleged document that was selectively released yesterday to Mr Peter Hartcher of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>. I would make two observations about that. The first is that the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) did not have the courtesy to actually give the document to the Opposition or anyone else&mdash;he gave it selectively to Mr Hartcher. In the past when I have made comments with respect to the Minister, Mr Hartcher has quite correctly gone back to the Minister for his response. I think that is fair and reasonable. It is interesting to note that Mr Hartcher did not have the courtesy to come to me with the sorts of allegations he was about to make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The claims made in the article were erroneous in the extreme. The Minister claimed that there could be no savings of the kind outlined in the coalition's Fightback package. This is a second attempt by the Government to complain about the figures in the coalition's Fightback package. One of the Treasurers, whose name I have forgotten&mdash;I think it was Mr Willis&mdash;made some attempt back in December of last year to respond to this aspect of the Fightback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The then Treasurer said that it was not sensible to base estimates of net savings on a 1991-92 static base. As everyone knows, the Fightback package was based on 1991-92 figures. That is eminently sensible. The use of Forward Estimates would have caused great concern because they are fairly rubbery and could not be relied upon as being accurate. The 1991-92 figures are, of course, as close as we can get under this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point was made within this article, again quite incorrectly, that the redundancy payments would be so high in fact as to be above the amount allowed for within the Fightback package. I make it quite clear what that amount was. It was an amount of $200m per year over a three-year period&mdash;I think it came to $550m in total. I should point out that the detail with respect to the Fightback package was established well in advance of the estimates that we looked at last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The complaint is made that we would have to pay out some thousands of dollars&mdash;in fact, a figure of $50,000 per person is used&mdash;for redundancy. I am not going to quibble about $50,000, except to say that in Estimates last year the figure used and given to me by the Department was $30,000. Let us not quibble too much about that. In the report to Mr Hartcher&mdash;which hopefully I will get at some time&mdash;the Minister, the Department or whoever says, `Horror of horrors, we will have to pay this redundancy figure'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What came out in the Estimates was that just in Asset Services, the provision has been made by the Minister&mdash;and this is his answer to me in October last year&mdash;that between now and 1993-94 some 850 people will be made redundant. That was the Department's own plan just for Asset Services!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of Question Time, I was given the opportunity to ask Senator Bolkus, `Okay, what provision have you made for the whole Department between now and 1993-94?'. He could not answer the question. This is the man who is supposedly the Government's expert on business enterprises. He is one of the most commercially incompetent and illiterate Ministers in the Government. That is not saying much. That puts him right down in the pits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is that here is a person who should be concerned about what is happening to his Department. Certainly, it is being commercialised. We have no objection to that and we have encouraged the Department to go along that track. We have also encouraged it to go along the track of profit and loss accounts, balance sheets, notes to the accounts and things like that so that we can clearly identify items. In his response, for some reason Minister Bolkus pulled out of the air a figure of $540m. Mr President, I have no idea where the $540m comes from. He says that we made a mistake of $540m. All we offered to do, using the Department's own figures, was make a saving of $230m over a two-year period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also referred to Professor Domberger and implied somehow that we used the Domberger model to determine the savings. Nothing could be further from the truth. We looked at each individual business unit. Domberger claims in all the work he has done, as does Rimmer from the Industries Commission, that with a contracting out process there are probably savings that vary between 20 and 35 per cent. If we look simply at the contracting out basis&mdash;and it varies on the particular business unit; we cannot generalise&mdash;it gives us some idea of the detail and the effort that we put into it. Professor Button would be aware of non-generalisation although he does it fairly frequently. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The conservative estimate taken was that there would be a 15 per cent saving if work was contracted out rather than done by government. The initial savings, and this was in the prunings of the various areas, are simply based on the facts that came out in last year's Estimates Committee. It was work that we did without having the knowledge of what was going to be in the Forward Estimates or the Budget and we simply used those.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, this was pointed out by Mr Willis when he was Treasurer. He said, `We do not like your savings. The reason we do not like your savings is that we were going to do it anyway. So if we were going to do it anyway, you cannot have them'. That was the reason that he said we should not be using the 1991-92 static base. Have you ever heard such nonsense? The Government had been in office for eight years and who was going to believe it? Its credibility was absolutely shot to pieces by this sort of nonsense comment and the report brought out today. The Finance Minister failed, yet here we have Senator Bolkus, who has no credibility when it comes to business matters, thinking he can succeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just to touch on one other point that he made, he again showed his complete lack of understanding of business principles when he talked about the Overseas Property Group and its administration. We took the 1991-92 figures and we looked at the recurrent costs. We said, `We are going to reduce recurrent costs by that amount of money'. That was not related in any way to cutting back staff or saving in administration costs at all. It was simply an identification of recurrent expenditures that we would reduce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, there is no doubt that a false assumption has been made by the Department. In fact, as I said, I believe the Minister to be economically illiterate. It is not just my belief, it comes from the other side of the Parliament as well. I have also supported the fact that the Department has gone down the commercial track. Again I say this without seeing the report, because the Minister did not show me the courtesy of giving it to me, but it seems to me that if these figures are genuine&mdash;and they are probably about as genuine as the figures that came out to the current Treasurer recently on the whole Fightback package&mdash;then the Government has a long, long way to go if it is to mirror the private sector with regard to commerciality and business principles. </PARA>

<PARA>Senator Collins, in his answer today, said that the Thomson-CSF radar system was safe. I merely quote from a letter from the Civil Air Operations Officers Association of Australia, dated 31 October, to Mr Frank Baldwin, the CEO of the CAA. The letter reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unfortunately I must point out to the Civil Aviation Authority that Civil Air members will not be held culpable or responsible for incidents or accidents occurring due to the failure of the radar to perform satisfactorily.</PARA>
<PARA>The letter goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While our members will continue to operate with their normal professionalism and with due regard to the duty of care, they cannot be expected to be responsible for equipment shortcomings, particularly if they are unaware of them.</PARA>
<PARA>So the radar system may be safe in a technical sense, but as was pointed out to me on the phone just a couple of minutes ago by Civil Air, it does not believe the Thomson-CSF system is as safe as the alternatives. Moreover, I think it is merely a case that this system is safe because it is better than having nothing at all. Consideration should be given to these comments, because Thomson-CSF is still substandard, is still unsatisfactory, and still puts lives at risk. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Button, in explaining the terms of the leave granted to Senator O'Chee to take note of an answer, said that in future it would not be the Government's practice to grant leave if this process is abused. I put it to you, Mr President, that this process has been adopted because of the abuse that is occurring on the other side of the chamber during Question Time.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, with respect, I thought that your threat to honourable senators on this side of the chamber during Question Time was, in all the circumstances of Question Time, unbalanced. What was allowed was considerable abuse on the other side in relation to the answering of questions. Only 14 questions and three supplementary questions were answered, as I calculated today&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Including the extra one; I acknowledge the extra one. That is how many questions were asked and answered during Question Time, and t<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>he questions were not particularly long today. You will say to me, Mr President, that there were certainly some interjections, and I recognise that. But the interjections were, I put to you, in the circumstances, related to the abuse that was occurring in the answers to questions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, Senator Collins was asked a question about inconsistency in relation to the application of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs to certain responsibilities that he has. The answer turned out to be a tirade of abuse against the Northern Territory Government which had nothing whatsoever to do with the question that was asked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cook was allowed, basically under the guise of Question Time, to debate the front page of yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> in relation to an academic paper produced by some Melbourne think-tank. It did not relate to the administration of his portfolio at all. I will be interested to go back and check the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, but I do not think the question asked him what would be the effect of the Government implementing that as a policy. If that was not the case, the question was also out of order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to Senator O'Chee, Senator Collins purported to read from a press release that he did not have, and that was apparently inaccurate in any event. It is not surprising that Senator O'Chee became somewhat frustrated by that abuse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then Senator Bolkus was unable to answer a question asked by Senator Parer. We expect to get a bit of huff and puff in circumstances where a Minister cannot answer a question, but we do not expect to get it for the best part of 10 minutes or for however long Senator Bolkus went on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Ministers are allowed to abuse the process in that way, it is not surprising that the Opposition becomes frustrated and has to use whatever opportunities are open to it, including seeking leave to take note of the answers and explain the position in fair and balanced terms at the end of Question Time. It is in those circumstances that this practice has arisen. If Ministers started getting back within the Standing Orders during Question Time rather than abusing the process, the problems that develop afterwards or the problems that you are identifying as developing during Question Time, Mr President, would occur less often. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The statement read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am making this statement today to outline the steps the Government is taking to create an environment in which our pharmaceutical industry will prosper.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The pharmaceutical industry exhibits many of the characteristics which the Government is seeking to encourage in the manufacturing sector. It has the potential to make a major contribution to wealth creation and exports of high value-added manufactures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is an industry where competitive advantage is based on innovation and the endeavours of a highly skilled workforce. It offers the opportunity to derive greater economic benefit from our long term investment in our scientific and technological infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pharmaceuticals is also a global industry and there are sound reasons for the Government promoting participation in such industries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Global industries are dominated by very large firms and the barriers to entry are high:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">-<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">our firms need to be very competitive to survive in such an environment;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">-<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">they must have access to the latest technology and manufacturing know-how;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">-<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">this in turn places competitive pressure on supplier industries with wider benefits for the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is strongly committed to providing an environment in which the industry can realise its full potential.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That commitment to the development of the pharmaceutical industry should be seen in the context of the Government's approach to industry development generally, and high value-added industries in particular.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The major challenge facing Australia today is to address the structural imbalances in our economy and reduce the current account deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Historically, Australia's high standard of living has been very dependent on our role as an exporter of commodities. With the long term downward trend in the real prices of primary commodities, the relative demand for them on world markets and the agricultural protection practised by the major trading blocks there is an urgent need for Australia to diversify its export base.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The consequences of failing to address the structural imbalances in our trading patterns are declining living standards for all Australians and an inability to address  our current account problems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government recognises that a strong, dynamic and export oriented manufacturing base is an essential feature of an advanced economy. It also recognises that there is a role for Government in hastening the process of structural change, in upgrading our sources of competitive advantage and creating the mechanisms to link our industries into the global economy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government industry policy objectives must therefore be carefully focused on building a profitable and dynamic industrial base and developing our capacity to become a serious participant in high value-added industries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A central premise of industry policy must be to recognise innovation as the key to sustained economic growth&mdash;the Government has a role in supporting firms and industries which take up new technologies, and develop new products and processes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In establishing policy settings we must recognise that in global industries like pharmaceuticals, companies actively trade location of activity for government bestowed benefits. Given the long lead times, the high risk and the substantial investments involved in the pharmaceutical industry, a stable and attractive policy environment is a pre-requisite for investment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rationale for the Government placing a strong emphasis on high value-added manufactures is quite clear. High value-added, or elaborately transformed manufactures, are the fastest growing area of world trade and provide Australia with the opportunity to reduce its dependence on commodities or simply transformed manufactures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A stronger bias towards high value-added manufactures will mean that the volume and value of our exports will be less susceptible to exchange rate movements and the boom, bust cycles of commodity markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More sophisticated or high value-added goods and services are able to command price premiums on world markets which are reflected in higher wages and higher living standards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pharmaceuticals is an industry in which Australia has created some competitive advantage</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">-<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the foundations for establishing an internationally competitive industry in Australia are already in place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our competitive advantage has been created by long term public investment in the education and training of a highly skilled workforce, and our medical research infrastructure and through the provision of first world medical services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We also have an industry infrastructure which includes a number of medium sized indigenous firms which are already successful exporters and the subsidiaries of the major international pharmaceutical companies with linkages to the world's major markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Until recently, Australia has not been perceived as an attractive location for pharmaceutical activity, despite our high quality medical research capability, the availability of highly skilled people and our proximity to the expanding Asian market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reasons are obvious&mdash;a time-consuming drug approval system and prices for pharmaceutical products which are substantially lower than those of our major trading partners. Health policy objectives clearly had precedence over industry development objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the last decade, Australia has reacted to rising pharmaceutical costs by limiting prices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The introduction of the Factor f scheme has allowed us to retain the substantial benefits of low prices to consumers while capturing the opportunities for wealth creation and extracting an adequate return from substantial public investment in medical research and education and training.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has a low and, until recently with the introduction of the Pharmaceutical Industry Development Program, a declining level of pharmaceutical production.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The import-export ratio in the mid 1980's was 2:1, but now stands at 3:1.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This deterioration is not a reflection of the inability of local firms to be internationally competitive, but is largely the result of disinvestment by multinational pharmaceutical companies as they rationalise their regional production centres to more attractive locations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This ratio will improve rapidly. The benefits from investments undertaken by companies participating in the scheme will translate into rapidly growing exports. Our  export performance is predicted to match and overtake the demand for new and increasingly expensive imported drugs, and increasingly new drugs will be  developed and manufactured here.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the measures already in place and the new initiatives that I will announce today, the Government is confident that it will have in place a framework which will  comprehensively address the major impediments to the industry's competitiveness.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Extension of Factor f</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recognition of the negative impact of PBS pricing on industry development, the Government introduced the Factor f scheme in 1987 as a major component of its Pharmaceutical Industry Development Program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority (PBPA) is charged with taking into account eight factors when determining appropriate prices for products listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Factor f is so named because it is the sixth factor taken in account by the Pricing Authority. The Authority is required to give due consideration to the level of activity being undertaken by the company in Australia including investment, production and research and development where that activity is internationally competitive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The scheme has been instrumental in changing industry perceptions about Australia as an investment location. As a result of the outstanding success of the scheme, the Government has decided to extend Factor f until mid-1999:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">-<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">in just three years Factor f has generated over $500 million in additional activity;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">-<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">companies plan to increase exports of human use pharmaceuticals from $162 million in 1987 to around $540 million a year by 1993;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">-<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">470 jobs in the industry have been created; another 390 jobs have been retained in facilities which would otherwise have been shut down. These 860 jobs represent over 10 percent of the industry's workforce;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">-<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the ten participating companies are planning to invest $375 million in new manufacturing and research facilities; as a result of this increased investment activity, over 700 jobs have been created in the construction sector;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">-<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent survey of 22 of the major pharmaceutical companies operating in Australia indicates a significant increase in research and development expenditure as a percentage of turnover. R&amp;D has increased from 2.9 per cent of sales in 1987 to over 6.5 per cent in 1990;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">-<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is now firmly established as a strategic centre for manufacture of a number of human use pharmaceuticals.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Glaxo Australia Pty Ltd, the first Factor f participant, has become the Glaxo Group's strategic centre for products manufactured using Blow-Fill-Seal production technology. These products include Glaxo's top selling anti asthma product Ventolin Nebules. Future applications of Blow-Fill-Seal technology will include plastic ampoules and intra nasal dose forms of other new products. Glaxo will invest $114 million in new facilities including $38 million in Blow-Fill-Seal facilities in Australia, effectively doubling its export capacity. Glaxo anticipates it will invest a further $60 million in additional, state-of-the-art  production facilities between 1995 and the year 2000. Australia will also become a strategic manufacturing centre for metered dose inhalers using non ozone depleting propellants.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme (Australia) Pty Ltd plans to establish a major manufacturing facility in Australia to service world markets. Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme has increased its exports from just $2 million a year in 1986 to $62 million last year and now manufactures a range of products for markets around the world. The company aims to achieve exports of $250 million a year by the end of the decade.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd is investing $11 million in new production facilities at its Noble Park plant in Melbourne including a cardiovascular suite which will employ the latest production technology. This investment has enabled Bristol-Myers Squibb to double its manufacturing capacity to produce a range of products for markets around the world;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">-<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Factor f has also been the catalyst for a number of research  based alliances which in the longer term can be expected to result in substantial exports</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Glaxo Australia and Biota Holdings are supporting research by the CSIRO's Division of Biomolecular Engineering and the Victorian College of Pharmacy into the development of an influenza drug;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Merck Sharp and Dohme and AMRAD Corporation Ltd, the Australian R&amp;D based company have established an alliance based on an innovative research and comarketing arrangement. Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme has invested over $8 million in AMRAD and a joint venture company, AMRAD Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd, markets four of Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme's products under licence. This arrangement provides AMRAD with the opportunity to develop marketing expertise and provides a cash flow to fund further R&amp;D. AMRAD is currently the fastest growing pharmaceutical company in Australia  and will ultimately have the capability to develop and commercialize a range of Australian biomedical discoveries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In extending the scheme, the Government has made a number of changes to ensure it more effectively achieves its objectives:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">-<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the 10 percent cap on individual Factor f entitlements has been removed; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">-<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">some increased flexibility<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"> </EMPHASIS>has been introduced in the eligibility criteria, particularly for proposals based on qualitative criteria.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of companies which have expressed a strong interest in participating in the scheme will now be able to do so. I am aware of some very exciting proposals from both existing and potential participants which are currently in the pipeline.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Reform of Drug Evaluation Procedures</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The low prices paid for pharmaceutical products in Australia has not been the only constraint on industry development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has had a relatively slow regulatory system with unique drug evaluation requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the early 1980's companies were often unwilling to manufacture new products in Australia due to the long delays in products reaching the market. As it is essential for new products to reach the market as soon as possible, Australia has lost opportunities to become a strategic centre for the manufacture of these products for world markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of the widespread dissatisfaction with the performance of Australia's drug evaluation system, the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services in March last year asked Professor Peter Baume to conduct an inquiry into our evaluation system and to recommend ways in which the system could be improved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister has subsequently announced that the recommendations of the Baume review would be implemented in full. Implementation is on schedule.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's prompt acceptance of Professor Baume's recommendations is a demonstration of our commitment to ensuring Australia has a drug evaluation system which is internationally competitive and harmonised with international practice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The implementation of the Baume recommendations will provide for strict evaluation times which will ensure that new drugs are available in a timely manner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our regulatory requirements and procedures will be harmonised with those in the major international markets for pharmaceuticals, particularly the EC and the USA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And much greater use will be made of the opportunities available for obtaining evaluation reports from other regulatory agencies which also have advanced standards of evaluation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Progress has already been made in a number of areas including the harmonisation of Australian data requirements and drug evaluation processes with those in the EC and USA is proceeding on target.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am pleased to note the recent appointment of a new National Manager for the Therapeutic Goods Administration, Dr Geoffrey Vaughan, whose charter is to implement the Baume recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Effective Patent Life</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Protection of intellectual property is a critical issue for research based companies in terms of providing effective patent life to ensure an adequate return on investment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An important element of the industry development program announced in 1987 was the extension of patent life for pharmaceuticals from 16 to 20 years to compensate for a slow drug registration system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is concerned that effective patent life in Australia is not reduced by delays in the drug approval process. It is closely monitoring the implementation of improvements to the regulatory system to ensure Australia's patent term remains competitive with that provided by our major trading partners.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similarly, the Government will monitor and respond to any moves by other countries to extend the patent life for pharmaceuticals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Minimum Pricing Policy</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1990 the Government introduced its Minimum Pricing Policy which has, as one of its objectives, the development of a local generic manufacturing industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of companies have benefited from the Minimum Pricing Policy, including indigenous companies engaged in the production of generics and enhanced generic products.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The pharmaceutical industry in general has welcomed the opportunity for increased price competition and the Australian tax-payer will benefit through the budget savings within the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Industry/Government Consultative Forum</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The profitability and hence the viability of the local pharmaceutical industry is vitally dependent on the policy environment in which the industry operates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Primarily for health policy reasons, the pharmaceutical industry is very heavily regulated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has very clear health policy objectives&mdash;it wishes to ensure that pharmaceuticals introduced into the Australian market are safe and effective and that essential drugs are available to the community at an affordable price. It is also concerned to contain budget outlays for health care.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The pharmaceutical industry in Australia has had a long history of inquiries trying to solve the problem created for industry development by Australia's national pharmaceutical benefits scheme. There was one in 1977; two in 1979; three in 1980; one in 1981; two in 1985; two in 1986; three in 1987; one in 1988; and two in 1989. That shows how many inquiries there have been into the supply of pharmaceuticals. This is another step in trying to sort out the industry and some of the problems it faces.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been a case of trying to serve two apparently mutually exclusive objectives: inexpensive access to human use pharmaceuticals, and local industry development. The Factor f scheme has been and is an attempt to reconcile both. Last year the Bureau of Industry Economics evaluated the Factor f scheme after its first few years of operation. A report followed another report in the mid-1980s by the Industries Assistance Commission, which was on the whole less enthusiastic about assistance, or at least neutralisation of the distortions, than perhaps the Government or the coalition would have liked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, partly in response to this latest BIE report, the Government has announced continuation of the Factor f program until 1999. As the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) outlined in detail in the speech he has incorporated, in recent years some very promising developments have occurred in the industry, often through joint ventures between industry participants and Australia's highly regarded medical research bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, we have been told that there has been an increase in activity since the inception of the scheme of over $500m, with planned exports increasing from $162m to $540m in 1993. Research and development activity has increased to over 6.5 per cent of turnover from 2.9 per cent. On these measures at least the scheme so far has appeared to have led to a stronger local pharmaceutical industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Factor f scheme has been operating since 1987. The coalition has not opposed it in the broad in recognition of the clear and unique market distortion which exists as a result of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority is a monopoly buyer on behalf of all Australians. Not surprisingly, and as economic theory would suggest, it has the power, which it has used, to keep the prices as low as possible. This has resulted in sizeable gains to Australians who have been able to buy drugs at very low prices&mdash;among the lowest in the world. The Report of the Bureau of Industry Economics quotes from the report of the Industries Assistance Commission in 1986, which concluded that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the international price comparisons leave little doubt that, in aggregate, PBS pricing policies have reduced prices for PBS drugs below the levels which would prevail in the absence of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other side of the coin, however, is that local companies have had no incentive to establish their own research and development operations, which is absolutely vital to growth in this research driven industry. Pharmaceutical companies need to get a return which is great enough to finance research and development of new products. It is this element that they just had not been getting through the PBPB, as it then was; it was a missing factor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been different views put over the years about what should be done. There have been numerous inquiries under governments of various persuasions keen to see a local industry developed. As already mentioned, the Industries Assistance Commission in the mid-1980s essentially concluded that arrangements should be left as they were because the impact on the local industry, although negative, had been small. I quote from the Bureau of Industry Economics report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conceivably the most important way in which the pricing environment might have adversely affected the level of activity during this period is in terms of potential opportunities forgone.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, forget about local industry development and continue to buy the drugs which Australians need at the lowest possible prices. Certainly that is a large gain that we cannot ignore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it does not seem reasonable or sensible to impair growth of one industry because of potentially dynamic government-sponsored arrangements, if that distortion can be overcome in a way which eventually generates an overall net gain to the community. There is a good case to at least neutralise the distortion as far as local industries are concerned. In other words, not to give them excessive assistance, but to give them a neutral springboard, just as other industries should not have to put up with costly regulations and requirements and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is, in essence, the reasoning behind the factor F program, which adds another price factor&mdash;the sixth factor&mdash;to the list to be taken into account when the Authority buys pharmaceuticals. As I have already said, this scheme has been operating now for nearly five years and was due to lapse in 1993, pending the review by the Bureau of Industry Economics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Late last year, the Bureau released its analysis and evaluation of the program. One would have to say that the Bureau was not over-enthusiastic about the scheme. It did not explicitly recommend its continuation, but it did say that continuation of the scheme would probably be necessary to ensure continued growth in the industry. Its report stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">failure to continue to compensate for suppressed prices may mean that Australia misses out on the current window of opportunity as a regional base for new activity.</PARA>
<PARA>It also recommended a number of improvements, if the scheme were to continue, which would help to ensure national benefits, and principal amongst these was that the rate of compensation should be reduced. Specifically, its recommendations were: payment of compensation through explicit pricing increases rather than notional amounts; reduction of the ceiling on price increases from the world to the EC average; removal of the 10 per cent price cap on annual price increases; more equitable treatment of domestic value added for existing products; inclusion of hospital sales of ethical pharmaceuticals, and more sympathetic consideration of eligibility on the basis of qualitative factors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bureau also recommended that, if the scheme were to be continued, it should be subject to an evaluation not later than five years hence. Overall, one could say that the Bureau was equivocal about the impact of the scheme, although it unequivocally said that up to now it thought that the costs outweighed the benefits, that national welfare had been reduced. But it is also fair to say that the Bureau concluded on balance that the risk of not continuing with the scheme&mdash;the cost opportunities lost&mdash;could be greater than the loss generated by the scheme. In other words, we could not afford to miss out on that window of opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition broadly agrees with the BIE's evaluation, although we also think that there are other impediments to the industry's development which must be addressed, and I will come to these a little later. We recognise that there is a distortion in the market created, not only by the pricing arrangements, but also by the lengthy&mdash;and I repeat that, lengthy&mdash;drug evaluation and approval procedures which the Minister has alluded to in his statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we accept the BIE's caution that the industry should not be overcompensated for the price distortions and nor should the scheme be so directive and bureaucratic that inefficient patterns of production result. That would be counterproductive for the industry and for the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, the Government, as I have already said, has announced the continuation of the scheme until 1999. It has also picked up a couple of the Bureau's recommendations&mdash;namely, removal of the 10 per cent price cap on annual price increases, and some increased flexibility in the eligibility criteria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the BIE report, the removal of the capping will allow firms to obtain the full entitlement that their commitment to additional activity would otherwise allow. Previous arrangements did not provide for full entitlement in all circumstances. The BIE notes that this will go some way in addressing the issue of undercompensation for some firms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The BIE noted that the qualitative and quantitative hurdles sometimes prevented firms from getting access to the scheme when, in a deregulated environment, the level of activity would have been increased. The increased flexibility in the eligibility criteria has been accepted to address this problem, which is primarily one of under-compensation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister's statement appears silent regarding the basis for factor F pricing. Will the world average price, rather than the EC average price, continue to be used contrary to the Bureau's strong recommendation?  Will compensation be paid through explicit price increases as the BIE recommends? The community's interest would be better served if the Government explained if and why it has rejected some of the BIE's recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, the coalition recognises the particular problems of this industry and has said so on many occasions to the pharmaceutical manufacturers. We want to see a truly competitive, locally based industry develop. There is a window of opportunity which we should, by all accounts, have the ability and the capacity to take full advantage of. We have some of the best medical research laboratories in the world. We have very talented people. It would be tragic if that potential were undermined by arrangements in the health industry, even if these were for the best of reasons&mdash;the health of the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly there has been an urgent need to improve drug approval procedures. It is encouraging to see that in the statement the Minister recognised the importance of this to the industry. When I read that the Minister said that Australia has had a relatively slow regulatory system with unique evaluation requirements, I was amazed. What an understatement. Examples of some of the delays in approvals of drugs that have been overseas are numerous. Senator Knowles has outlined on innumerable occasions the delay in the approval of oestrogen patches. There has also been delay in the approval of Marvelon, Clozapine, Alfentanyl, and a number of other drugs. When Professor Baume completed his report into drug evaluation in Australia, the coalition welcomed it and called on the Government to implement the recommendations immediately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Already a number of Professor Baume's recommendations have been implemented but, as yet, it is too soon to be able to judge the effectiveness of these reforms. However, there are still examples constantly coming to our attention of delays in drug approvals. One example is a drug called GCSF, or growth colony stimulating factor. GCSF was first discovered in Australia and is now available in at least 17 countries around the world, including the USA, UK, Germany and New Zealand, but it has still not been given general marketing approval here. It is actually mentioned in the BIE report as an example of a rare Australian pharmaceutical discovery. This Government seems to have a long way to go in fixing the problem of delays in the approval of drugs like this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a problem with a drug called Benemid, manufactured by Merck Sharp and Dohme. Due to manufacturing problems, the Australian formulation was taken off the market. The company sought approval from the TGA to place the New Zealand formulation of Benemid on the market. The New Zealand product met all specifications. However, approval was not given. The irony is that, in order to gain access to the product, some doctors have been advised by TGA that their patients can gain supplies from the New Zealand market. So Australians have access to this drug, but through New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been an urgent need to improve drug approval procedures and, as I have said before, it is encouraging to hear the Minister recognise the importance of this to the industry. We also recognise the importance of the factor F program and the changes the Government has introduced which should improve the industry's efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other areas of concern in the pharmaceutical industry is drug approvals for `export only' products. This matter was addressed specifically in a Bureau of Industry Economics report, which noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the new 1989 Therapeutic Goods legislation, the listing of export-only products on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods is to involve the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">same</EMPHASIS> review process as applies to the listing of goods to be supplied to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> market (ie. largely on the basis of Section 26(1) of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Therapeutic Goods Act 1989</EMPHASIS>). That is, export-only products will have to meet all Australian requirements unless specific assurance is obtained from the importing country that it is prepared to accept goods that do not meet those requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It must be questioned as to why there is a need to impose Australian requirements on goods produced specifically for another country, without request by the importing country for such scrutiny. Such requirements would seem unnecessary because there is already a mechanism in place that is internationally recognised for providing information to importing countries if so required. . . Under this scheme, administered by the TGA, an importing country can request information from the regulatory authority in the exporting country in regard to whether the product is sold in the country of origin, whether it meets GMP standards and whether the product conforms to that stated. . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The pharmaceutical industry does not object to controls over export-only drugs, but to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">excessive</EMPHASIS> controls over these products.</PARA>
<PARA>This is not a document from the pharmaceutical industry; this is what is said in a report of the Bureau of Industry Economics. The report goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In view of the importance of efficient procedures in this area for export activity, the Bureau considers that regulation in the area of export-only drugs should be directed solely at achieving as efficiently as possible, industry and trade policy objectives.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no reference to this in this statement. We are told in the current statement that the Minister has placed before us today that one aspect of the problem is being looked at. But this issue is not being looked at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A company which is located just around the corner from my office is an example of what is happening. The new export certification requirements mean that that company must include on its certificates the words that the product is for export only. That is Australia's requirement. But what is happening? The company is finding that its export markets are closing because, by implication, the importing countries think that drugs manufactured only for export must be of a somewhat lesser quality. Importing countries are of a mind that we are dumping on to them a drug or a therapeutic good which does not meet good manufacturing standards or practice. In fact, I have explained and the Bureau has explained that that is not the case, that international standards have to be met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are in fact hindering the export of products because of a regulation that is not required by importing countries and that is not required by international standards. It is a case of over-regulation. So what has happened to that company around the corner from me in Clayton? Thousands of people are about to lose their jobs in Nissan and hundreds of people will lose their jobs in other industries associated with the car industry. Reports come into my office daily of other companies in the area closing down. When we need jobs, what is happening?  The American parent company of that pharmaceutical company around the corner from me wants to invest $25m in capital plant in the area. But it is not doing so because of the uncertainty and because of the reduction in export markets created by this sort of policy. Jobs are going down the drain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">And where is that parent company thinking of putting that plant?  Not in Australia, but somewhere in Asia. This is not happening because of lack of support or money. I have spoken about this sort of thing before in this chamber. The parent company wants the regulations to be freed up. It is not trying to do anything tricky. All it wants to do is abide by international standards and good manufacturing practice and to be free from the burden and the bondage of over-regulation. Yet Australians are expecting that company to write on its export certification the words `For export only'. As I said, this regulation is not required by the importing country and it is not required by international standards. This regulation which we have imposed on ourselves is actually hindering the pharmaceutical export market. So, unless these other problems are addressed, the report that the Minister has tabled is cold comfort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian company that I have referred to has a dozen other products up for re-registration in a major overseas market. However, the export certificates are not acceptable to the country to which it exports and it is losing dollars. So dollars already are being lost; jobs are being lost because the parent company is not investing capital; and also we look like losing yet another market. I would not be surprised if that Australian company were to come around to tell me that it is reducing its manufacturing in the area as well and that maybe more jobs will be lost. That company has already put off 21 people in the last 12 months or so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister's statement is short on details regarding its response to the BIE recommendations and, indeed, the expected cost to taxpayers of the new arrangements. As I have already said, the coalition does not believe that lack of information about the scheme serves either the interests of the industry or the community well. We certainly would like more information on all these matters before embracing all elements of the new arrangements. In addition, we consider that there is a need for ongoing assessment of the program to ensure that the benefits are there not only for the industry but for all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is, however, that the Government's announcement today, welcomed as it might be by the industry, does not go far enough. It addresses but one element of the industry's disadvantages. I have addressed the other ones&mdash;the delay in approvals and the problems with the `export only' certification. The coalition is committed to reducing the industry's costs across the board and improving the environment in which it operates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other problems that the industry has outlined to me concerns transport. Some of the products that the industry manufactures are very susceptible to heat, have a use-by date and can be damaged. I was given the example of export-bound pharmaceutical products which were totally damaged by water after sitting on a tarmac, a wharf or something for some time. Drugs waiting to be exported cannot sit on wharves. There needs to be an assurance that these exports will be dealt with efficiently on the waterfront. The goods have to be delivered on time and not left sitting on wharves for long periods in the heat and rain. So there needs to be an environment which is reliable, especially in the waterfront area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as creating an environment which reduces industry's costs in terms of transport, the coalition will be bringing about the abolition of payroll tax and wholesale sales tax. It will make significant micro-economic reforms, which will be just as significant for the pharmaceutical industry as any other industry. However, in particular they will be significant for industries that export. Indeed, from discussions between the industry and the shadow Minister we know that the gains to the industry from our policies will be significant indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with this Government is that it has concentrated on the specific rather than the broad. There is no doubt that the pharmaceutical industry had very major and specific impediments. This should not divert attention from the equally urgent need to tackle economy-wide impediments so that the industry can build on its strength and become truly world competitive. I know that when the coalition puts its policies into place, the industry will benefit greatly. </PARA>

This is a very important statement, released at a time when we are seeking to enhance Australia's economic self-reliance and increase the value and volume of our exports.

This industry has massive growth potential and in time could help significantly in our trade performance and balance of payments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the industry has the potential to tap into the clever country by building on the important and internationally recognised expertise here in Australia covering a wide variety of medical and paramedical services and industries. Our medical schools are excellent and as a result Australia is a world leader in biomedical research. Our own doctors and surgeons are at the forefront of breakthroughs in treatment and the understanding of human physiology, and we have diagnostic services which are on a par with anything in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats believe that with careful strategic planning we can develop an integrated medical industry in this country spanning research, treatment and support services which not only delivers economic and health benefits to the Australian public, but also to the international community. Australia could conceivably become an international centre of medical excellence across a range of fields. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statement before us today is an important step in developing Australia's role in pharmaceuticals manufacturing. We welcome the extension of the Factor f scheme until mid-1999. As the Minister has outlined, pharmaceuticals research and development has doubled from 2.9 per cent of sales in 1987 to over 6.5 per cent in 1990; a statistic that can be directly attributed to changes introduced in 1987 under the pharmaceutical industry development program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We support the Government's commitment to fostering Australian research and development in all areas, and not only that of the pharmaceutical industry. However, we strongly criticise the Government's recent reduction of research and development write-offs from 150 per cent to 125 per cent. The Australian Democrats believe that this write-off should be returned immediately to 150 per cent if the Government is to have any credibility about its commitment to R&amp;D investment. The Minister mentions a significant increase in R&amp;D expenditure in 22 major pharmaceutical firms, and I have already outlined those statistics. I would be interested to see the percentages this year after the reduction to 125 per cent. Despite these figures, it should be noted that, as reported in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Local subsidiaries of multinational companies dominate the Australian pharmaceutical industry, supplying 94 per cent of the market.</PARA>
<PARA>We are not talking about Australian-owned companies with long-term profits staying in Australia. A locally grown pharmaceutical industry owned by Australians would be desirable, and we must take steps to encourage local competition in selected areas to balance the current dominance of multinationals. A return to the 150 per cent R&amp;D write-off would facilitate this process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, reform of the drug evaluation procedures are to be supported, bringing Australia into line with practices overseas. The Australian Democrats support immediate implementation of the Baume recommendations as outlined in the statement, along with continued monitoring of the effective patent life of a new drug. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reform of the drug evaluation process is long overdue, not only from an industry perspective, but also from the point of view of the very many terminally and seriously ill patients who have suffered from the slow, overly bureaucratic and unsympathetic regulation regime. While it is pleasing to at last see some progress in this area, I would remind Senator Button that the Government dragged its feet for years on this issue before finally deciding to do something. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recommendations made by Professor Baume in his review were far from radical, but he did identify one of the major issues in the administration of therapeutic goods, that is, the question of timely availability of drugs. The desirability of balancing that concern against the need to maintain high standards of safety is now going to have to be a major consideration. Our drug regulation system has in many ways been defined by two medical disasters: thalidomide and AIDS. These two catastrophes represent the opposite ends of the regulations spectrum. On the one hand, we want a system that provides adequate protection from dangerous or potentially dangerous new drugs, and on the other hand we want to make sure that we give people who have a terminal or life-threatening illness the best possible chance of survival. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Baume considered this tension between safety and availability very carefully and he pointed to the need for a balance between these two concerns. He also highlighted the fact that this balance was not really covered anywhere in the existing legislation and he saw that omission as having a significant impact on the performance of the Therapeutic Goods Administration and the perception it had of itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Baume also observed publicly&mdash;following the release of his report&mdash;that the TGA had virtually made up its own policies, because it was effectively operating in a policy vacuum. He noted that the drug evaluation branch within the TGA had never committed itself seriously to timeliness and seemed not to have in place any mechanisms to allow it to achieve prompt evaluation for most drugs. In short, there was a lack of accountability in the evaluation process generally and Professor Baume's report recommended some very specific time lines and performance indicators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Late last year the Senate passed legislation rectifying the imbalance in the Therapeutic Goods Act, giving our drug evaluators a clear statutory direction that timeliness is now to be one of their main aims. That legislation also provided much of the framework for reform of the TGA. The Democrats were strong supporters of this legislation, as we have been of the Baume review generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pace of reform still drags in some areas of our drug evaluation process, especially in the area of early access by terminally ill people to drugs which may be unapproved or experimental. However, overall, Professor Baume has done much to further the cause of sensible reform in this area and the Australian Democrats were&mdash;and remain&mdash;fully supportive of the Government's decision to implement these recommendations in full. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also support the establishment of an industry/government consultative forum, comprising DITAC officials and industry representatives, as a means of facilitating communication and understanding between industry and government on what may sometimes be competing policy and social objectives. In our opinion, such a forum should also include representatives of the medical profession and consumer groups, so that a wider range of issues than those simply related to the operations of pharmaceutical companies in Australia can be canvassed more widely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to a report in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> which I think is very pertinent to this issue. It indicated that some $200m a year is spent by the pharmaceutical industry on promoting their products to doctors. However, industry sources have suggested that the figure is closer to $100m, but this still represents an enormous sum of money; possibly as much as $8,000 to $10,000 per doctor, as suggested by Doctor Ken Harvey, a Melbourne microbiologist. Indeed, in a submission to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs the AMA has compared this enormous sum with the `mere hundreds of thousands of dollars put into independent education' about prescribed drug use and abuse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats believe that there should be more information on the public record about the vast sums of money spent by pharmaceutical companies on drug promotion to doctors in Australia, what this promotion involves and the kinds of freebies doctors are given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that recently the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) stated that every year some 20,000 to 40,000 people end up in hospital as a result of incorrect use of medications. We believe that both the medical profession and the pharmaceutical industry must bear some of the responsibility for education and a change in community attitudes regarding drug use and abuse. We hope that this very important public health issue will be dealt with by this new consultative forum at the earliest opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, it is our hope that this forum will recognise the public interest of any possible changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority guidelines when it examines the issue of drug pricing later this year. This is an issue of access to health services for disadvantaged groups, not simply one of profits for drug companies. Vital drugs must be affordable and accessible to all through the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With those provisos, we welcome the statement and hope that it goes some way towards developing an integrated medical services industry in this country which will help Australia become more economically self-reliant and which will deliver significant health benefits to Australians and the rest of the world. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to amplify several remarks which have been made by Senator Sowada and Senator Patterson relating to the statement made by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) on the pharmaceutical industry. I want to pick up two points: firstly, the point just made by Senator Sowada in relation to the close and potentially very dangerous links between the commercial development of drugs and their very heavy promotion by drug companies; and, secondly, the point which was touched on by Senator Patterson, namely, the failure of Australia to adequately develop some of the very good research work which is carried out in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pick up the second point first, and give two examples. Senator Patterson referred to the work which has gone on in Melbourne over 25 years on a number of cell stimulating factors which have now resulted in the commercialisation of that work overseas. The point that Senator Patterson was making was that while the drugs resulting from that work are now available overseas, they are not available in Australia. The point I want to make is that the commercialisation of that research work, which was carried out at enormous public expense over 25 years, should have gone on in this country and should not have gone on overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second example to which I draw attention is the work which went on over some years at the James Cook University on the extraction of a very effective UV blocking substance which could be incorporated into cream and used as a skin protectant against ultraviolet light. This is a very important development because Queensland has the highest incidence of skin cancer in the world and Australians, generally, have a very high incidence. This was a natural substance which had considerable benefits in terms of protecting humans against what will almost certainly be a much greater incidence of ultraviolet light. Yet again, that development&mdash;that fundamental research work, which went on over quite some years&mdash;has passed out of Australia's hands and, I understand, is now in the hands of ICI and is likely to be developed overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this general area there is no doubt that in the past Australia has been, as several speakers have said, a leader in medical research, both in the universities and in a number of research institutes around the country. We are in danger of losing that pre-eminent position because of the downgrading of education in general, and research effort in the universities in particular, in recent years under the Hawke and now the Keating Government. That needs to be substantially reversed if we are going to keep that pre-eminent position. Beyond that&mdash;and not only in the medical area, but certainly in the medical area&mdash;we have failed to turn that often excellent research work into products which can then be marketed and which would be of longer term economic benefit to this country. That is the basis of Senator Button's statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply stress that we need to perform much better in that area. I do not see a great deal in Senator Button's statement that will necessarily guarantee that, although I agree with Senator Sowada that we support this statement. It is good as far as it goes, but perhaps we need to go much further. Much more emphasis needs to be placed on the Australian pharmaceutical industry rather than simply multinational companies which are operating in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the other point, there is no doubt that in recent decades we have seen massive corruption in the pharmaceutical industry when it comes to those very large vested interests and their ability to promote the use of drugs which are worth hundreds of millions of dollars to them in sales. We have seen the results of tests which have not been based on properly carried out research work, and which should have been submitted to the regulatory authorities, being manufactured. We have seen the suppression of information by companies which should have made that information available to the regulatory authorities. It is absolutely necessary that the regulatory authorities in this country, no less than in other countries, have available to them independent sources of information; they should not be totally dependent upon the information provided by the company which is seeking to register the particular drug for human use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that respect&mdash;this is the last point I want to pick up&mdash;I was disturbed to received a reply from Senator Button a few weeks ago to a question of mine relating to the close links between commercial interests and research work. The question was actually based not in the medical area but in another area. In the course of his reply, Senator Button pointed out that research workers in this country are now spending 20 per cent of their time writing grant applications and making reports back to the grantees of research funds. I find it somewhat disturbing that people who are very often at the forefront of research work have to spend one-fifth of their time involved in that sort of activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Button went on to point out that in his view this was an advantage because not only did it link the research work with the commercial company but also&mdash;I do not have his words in front of me, so I will paraphrase them&mdash;it helps to set the agenda of the research work. I find that rather frightening if one carries it over into the context of medical research. Medical research&mdash;which should be unfettered by commercial interests&mdash;should be designed, without reservation, for furthering human benefit in terms of human health, and should not be linked in any way with these extremely powerful commercial interests which might be able to distort the results of that work. For instance, one would see a movement to those drugs which are likely to be more profitable rather than those drugs which are likely to be of greater benefit. The closer ties between the commercial interests and the university and research institute activities, which we have seen under this Labor Government and which have been specifically encouraged by this Labor Government, are an extremely dangerous development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may seem that the two points that I have made are paradoxically inconsistent. I want to emphasise that the fundamental research work should be divorced from those commercial interests. When research developments indicate that a commercial possibility can develop from that research work, it seems to me that the Government has not sufficiently created the conditions so that either government or private interests can take up that research work and ensure that those developments and their commercially profitable drugs, or whatever other agents come out the other end, are kept within this country. I stress those two points to the Minister in response to this statement on the pharmaceutical industry. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">31 March 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first report I have just tabled relates to the proposed redevelopment by the CSIRO of its facilities at North Ryde, New South Wales. The main elements of the proposal are:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">a rationalisation and consolidation of the CSIRO accommodation at North Ryde</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">a progressive release of approximately 15.8 hectares of identified surplus land and up to 11 development lots to create a science and technology park</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated out-turn cost of the work is $98 million to be funded from the sale and or lease of surplus land at North Ryde.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee found that the standard of facilities at North Ryde restricts the continuing development of industrially significant research initiatives with a high national priority for the biotechnology, mining and minerals, energy exploration and food industries as well as work of major environmental significance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Each of the divisions at North Ryde plays a major role in providing research vital to its industry sector. These sectors represent major components of the Australian economy and include:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">coal with exports of $6 billion</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">minerals with exports of $16 billion</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">pharmaceutical and diagnostic products currently imported at a cost of $3 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recommending that the proposal proceed the Committee has concluded that the development of a prestige science and technology park by the CSIRO at North Ryde is the most cost effective method available to it of providing the funds necessary for the development of high quality research facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the proposal has been referred at a very advanced conceptual stage the Committee has recommended that CSIRO provide it with detailed plans of each aspect of the proposal prior to the commencement of construction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is also satisfied, following assurances from CSIRO, that adequate provision has been made for additional expansion of facilities at North Ryde should this be necessary in the future and that the redevelopment strategy developed by CSIRO is realistic in current market conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, there is one aspect of the proposal which the Committee believes should not remain at North Ryde but should be relocated to the Riverina Region of New South Wales&mdash;I am referring to the Food Research Laboratory of the Division of Food Processing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee believes that the Food Research Laboratory can operate effectively from the Riverina Region as it has good transport links and an existing scientific base on which CSIRO could build. At the same time it would provide a stimulus to the scientific and industrial sectors in an important food growing and processing area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee strongly disagrees with the working party set up to examine the future structure of the Division of Food Processing which rejected non-capital locations with the professional needs of scientists being an overriding criteria.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee believes that CSIRO should be taking a national view when it examines such issues. In this situation it has a perfect opportunity to assist regional development, allow closer interaction with both food producers and processors and provide opportunities for contact with other scientists working in these industries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Having considered the evidence presented by CSIRO and from the Riverina Region and taking into account the views of the Sectional Committee which visited the area, the Committee has recommended that the Food Research Laboratory be transferred to the Riverina Region and that the Minister for Science and Technology do all within his power to ensure that the transfer takes place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has not recommended a particular site although the Sectional Committee did inspect a number of sites adjacent to the Charles Sturt University at Wagga Wagga. The Committee believes that the question of a particular site should be a matter for discussion between the CSIRO and the relevant authorities in the Riverina Region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second report which I have tabled deals with the proposed construction of a new permanent repository for the Australian Archives at East Burwood, Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This new building will provide up-to-date, climate controlled storage facilities for permanent value Commonwealth records in the custody of Archives in Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated cost of the proposed work is 6.5 million dollars at October 1991 prices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has recommended the construction of the proposed repository.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present, permanent value Commonwealth records are stored in a former dry cleaning factory in the suburb of Brighton. The Committee concluded, after inspecting the Brighton repository, that if permanent value Commonwealth records remain stored there, many irreplaceable records will be lost. In fact some have already been lost and others severely damaged. There is therefore an urgent need for Archives to be provided with a modern facility in which to store permanent value records in Victoria. Constructing a new repository at the existing site was considered impractical.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After an exhaustive site selection process for a new site, Archives settled on a site at East Burwood for the new repository. The site is eminently suited, being in a designated technology park, and not excessively distant from the Melbourne central business district.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A larger site could have been purchased but more distant from the main users of Archival materials.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The building itself will provide office accommodation, an area for conservation and a large storage area. The storage area will be on three levels. It will have a curved roof to accelerate water run-off, an essential requirement for buildings of this type.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The design is somewhat austere, but nevertheless reflects a need for functionality and a need for the building to be constructed of materials reflecting some cost-consciousness.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee questioned Archives about the ability of the building to be expanded. Archives advised the Committee that once all permanent value records are transferred to the new building, the building will have adequate capacity for another ten to twelve years growth. If by then there is a need to expand further, the site is large enough for extensions to the building to be provided. These extensions would provide additional storage area for another ten to twelve years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The building will be provided with a number of special features, including strengthened floors, special air-conditioning and fire protection measures. The need for these features was justified.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One thing I would like to mention in conclusion is that the Committee questioned Archives about their involvement in the Centenary of Federation. As Senators will know, Archives is the custodian of an extensive collection of papers relating to Federation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Archives advised the Committee that it will be looking to increasing publicity about its activities and holdings of material relating to Federation in its custody. I'm sure honourable Members will join me in supporting this nationally important endeavour.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>The third report I have tabled relates to the installation of fire sprinklers to the International Terminal Building (ITB) at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I should say at the outset that during its investigation the Committee took the view that this project should be examined on its merits and in isolation from issues relating to the third runway at Sydney Airport. Construction of the third runway was exempted from the scrutiny of the Committee on the grounds of urgency by the House of Representatives on 14 November 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ITB was opened in 1970 and met all the then relevant codes. Airport terminal buildings are not expressly covered by codes but they need to have adequate protection. A number of fire hazard reports have recommended installation of fire sprinklers to provide safety for the occupants of the building and to protect the property. Other improvements to provide smoke isolation, emergency evacuation system and additional fire exits were recommended.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the Federal Airports Authority (FAC) assumed responsibility for Sydney Airport on 1 January 1988 :</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">additional fire exits were constructed as part of a project which entailed a number of improvements to the ITB and was completed in 1989</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">smoke isolation measures have been substantially completed on existing stairwells and escalators</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The FAC has installed fire sprinklers in the International Terminal Complex at Sydney Airport which is scheduled for commissioning in December 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The design of this building was based on the assumption that the ITB would be upgraded by the provision of a sprinkler system so that a fire originating in the ITB would be contained within that building. The provision of a fire sprinkler system has been evaluated by the FAC as being necessary for the protection of both the occupants and the building and to achieve Building Code of Australia compliance. The building is vast and fire fighting after detection has been evaluated as being very difficult.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the Committee has recommended that the work proceed there are a number of issues in the report on which I should comment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The continued absence of a master plan for Sydney Airport is a matter of serious concern. In fact in 1988 in reporting on the construction of the International Terminal Complex the Committee recommended that the FAC prepare a master plan as expeditiously as possible to ensure the overall orderly development and operation of the Airport.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the FAC has appointed a consultant to finalise the master plan the Committee has recommended that the Minister for Shipping and Aviation direct the FAC to complete the master plan as a matter of extreme urgency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I should add that in the absence of a master plan the Committee is loath to recommend further work at Sydney Airport. However as this project concerns an issue of public safety the Committee has no option but to agree to the work proceeding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is concerned at the cost of the project&mdash;$14.6 million&mdash;and has recommended that the FAC review all aspects of the proposal to determine areas of possible cost savings. In relation to cost the Committee has also recommended that FAC commission a fire safety study to determine whether savings can be made in the provision of fire sprinklers. Evidence was given to the Committee which indicated that savings may be possible by limiting sprinklers to areas where they are required for life safety reasons or as cost effective fire protection.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>Mr President, on 9 May last year, the Minister tabled the final report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. The Minister indicated then that it was a very important document. Indeed, it is one of the most significant Australian social documents of our time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Report painted a graphic picture of the lives and the deaths of 99 Aboriginal people and in so doing it showed us something of the harshness and alienation that characterise daily life for so many of the first Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the occasion of tabling the Royal Commission Report, the Minister spoke of the Royal Commission findings about the lives of those who had died in custody. These statistics provide a graphic insight into the lives of Aboriginal people and should be again placed on the public record.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of the 99 who died between 1 January 1980 and 31 May 1989</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">88 were men and 11 were women</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Their approximate average age at death was 32</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;83 were unemployed at the date of their last detention</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;43 had experienced childhood separation from their natural families through intervention by State authorities, missions or other institutions</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;Only 2 of the 99 had completed secondary schooling</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;43 had been charged with an offence at or before age 15</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;43 were taken into custody in the period immediately before their deaths on matters directly related to the over-use of alcohol. The Royal Commission concluded that in the remaining cases alcohol was a contributing factor in their being taken into custody for the last time</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;The standard of health of the 99 varied from poor to very bad, with the average age of those dying from natural causes being a little over 30 years</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;63 of the deaths occurred in police custody, 33 in prison custody and 3 in juvenile detention facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are over-represented in custody at a rate&mdash;calculated nationally&mdash;of 29 times that of the general community. In some States the rate is considerably higher and has escalated during the very time of the Royal Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Royal Commission found this grossly unacceptable as does every fair-minded Australian and every political party represented in this Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If non-Aboriginal people had been imprisoned at the same rate over the period of the Royal Commission and then died in custody at the same rate, over 8500 non-Aboriginal people would have died. This comparison gives some idea of the enormity of the tragedy of wasted young Aboriginal lives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, the Royal Commission found the most significant factor in this deeply disturbing over-representation was the "disadvantaged and unequal position" of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in all aspects of Australian society&mdash;social and economic.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These conclusions impel governments to act to redress the disadvantage that is the fundamental cause of Aboriginal deaths in custody.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I would now like to speak to those most immediately affected&mdash;the families, relatives and friends of those who died.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I know that many still feel grief, anger and irreparable loss. I understand their anguish that the Royal Commission  did not find any death to be the result of deliberate unlawful violence or brutality. I know that for them this finding is difficult to accept.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It may be of little comfort to them to read that the Royal Commission found that in many cases death was contributed to by systems failures or absence of due care.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Royal Commission, however, made a finding of much deeper significance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those who died were not victims of isolated acts of violence or brutality. Rather they were victims of entrenched and institutionalised racism and discrimination. Their deaths were the tragic consequence of two centuries of dispossession, dispersal and appalling disadvantage. That is an unpalatable finding, but one which must be tackled head on.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a moral and political obligation on those in positions of political leadership, to bring about genuine, lasting change in the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. We must work so that the injustices documented by the Royal Commission become truly a thing of the past.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I hope that every Member of this Parliament supports the role of the Commonwealth in providing national leadership on this issue. The unanimous Parliamentary support for the reconciliation process must now be further translated for ongoing action to give effect to the Royal Commission recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Government is proud to announce its support for 338 of the 339 of the Royal Commission recommendations and will fund specific first stage initiatives which the Minister will announce today. As the Prime Minister has foreshadowed, the Government will make a second major announcement responding to the underlying issues highlighted by the Royal Commission within three months of today's tabling and I will later indicate the thrust of this response.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the Royal Commission investigated the lives and deaths of those 99 men and women, 25 more Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians have died in custody. We also owe it to them to make a just, effective and sustained response to the Report of the Royal Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, Aboriginal people and the wider Australian community are looking to all Governments to ensure that we do not waste the historic opportunity presented by the Royal Commission Report to deliver justice to Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of this increase in public concern, Governments around Australia have recognised the importance of working together on a national response to this uniquely national investigation. Each Government designated a Minister to coordinate its response. These Ministers met as a Joint Ministerial Forum and a Commonwealth-State-Territory Working Group of senior officials met regularly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All mainland States and Territories have participated in the Response by Governments that I have tabled today. Following the recent election in Tasmania, the State Government has undertaken to examine its position as expeditiously as possible and no doubt its response will be the focus of considerable attention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The responses to the 339 recommendations contained in the documents I have tabled are not confined to Aboriginal Affairs portfolios nor were they ever intended to be so. The Royal Commission's recommendations involve an enormous range of Commonwealth, State and Territory responsibilities. Each Government has responded on a whole-of-Government basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At a time of change in the relationship between Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments, the cooperation that has led to this response is an achievement not to be dismissed even by the more cynical of public commentators.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is an achievement for the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even more significant, Mr President, has been the involvement in this process of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, through nationwide consultations organised by ATSIC, and through the negotiation of the Commonwealth's response with the elected representatives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, ATSIC's Board of Commissioners.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We now have a coherent and comprehensive statement of Government policy arising directly from negotiation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people themselves. At the Commonwealth level, the ATSIC Board of Commissioners approved all 339 of the Commonwealth responses following nationwide consultations across Australia before they were approved by the Federal Cabinet.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a landmark in relations between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is committed to this process of negotiation and consultation in the development and delivery of all Commonwealth policies and programs in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This approach to our nation's relations with indigenous people underpins the process of reconciliation which was recognised by the Royal Commission as the fundamental backdrop to reform and change in Aboriginal affairs. As part of that process the Government has sought an ongoing national commitment to address Aboriginal disadvantage. This is the key to reversing the over-representation of Aboriginal people in custody.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Just as the Royal Commission was established by the Commonwealth Government and the States and the Northern Territory with the support of the Federal Opposition and as the direct result of concern by Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people, so the Response by Governments transcends boundaries of jurisdiction and political party.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the Royal Commission's Report is of major significance for Australia's international human rights record.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Internationally, Australia's human rights record is an open book. We are determined to maintain our commitment to ensuring the highest standards in our observance of human rights in Australia. Australia's accession to the First Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is a very real demonstration of this commitment. The Optional Protocol provides an international right of appeal for all Australians on human rights issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations, the Human Rights Commission and the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination are some of the international bodies vitally interested in the responses of Australian Governments to the Report. Amnesty International and other international non-government organisations will monitor the implementation of the Royal Commission's recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The declaration of 1993 as the International Year of the World's Indigenous Peoples also puts a spotlight on responses by Governments to the Royal Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Royal Commission confirmed that the principles of empowerment and self-determination are fundamental to change for Aboriginal people. The Royal Commission described the "pin pricking domination, abuse of personal power, utter paternalism, open contempt and total indifference" that confront Aboriginal people every day.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people aspire to control their lives and communities, in the same way that other Australians expect to control their lives and communities. It is for this reason that the Commonwealth seeks to ensure that to the greatest extent possible, and consistent with recommendation 192 of the Royal Commission, funding initiatives to respond to the Royal Commission are directed towards Aboriginal community controlled organisations. This approach is supported by all States and Territories in their responses to the Royal Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, such is the complex and comprehensive nature of the Royal Commission's Report that the Government has decided on the two stage approach to its response which I have already referred to.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now turn to the detail of the first stage of this Response.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact that responsibility for implementing the Royal Commission's detailed proposals for coronial, justice, police and custody reform lies largely with State and Territory Governments does not mean that the Commonwealth will abdicate its very significant responsibilities in this area. Indeed, as I will outline, we intend to act on the basis of the Commonwealth's commitment to the national interest and our clear direct responsibilities for human rights, the Australian Federal Police and the provision of legal assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth will also work to ensure essential Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander involvement in criminal justice issues, operations and reform.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An examination of the detailed documents I have tabled will show overwhelming support by all Governments for the law and justice reforms recommended by the Royal Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I believe all Governments want to turn this support into action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To facilitate this objective the Commonwealth will take a key role in the critical area of Aboriginal/police relations to give further support to the initiatives already under way in the States and Territories.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before I turn to the details of the Commonwealth's response on this issue, I want to make it clear that  Governments are not singling out police for criticism. As the Minister said on the occasion of the tabling of the Royal Commission Report ten months ago, the Royal Commission Report was not some police bashing exercise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The truth is that the police, like the rest of the community, have a range of attitudes and opinions. It is true that many non-Aboriginal Australians have a stereotyped view of Aboriginal values and culture. It is also true that Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians are already working together to bust these baseless stereotypes and to improve community relations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments intend to build on the valuable work already being done and to strive for a change in attitudes. We will also continue to insist on the highest operating standards for police and custody systems. Society cannot tolerate anything less.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth will set in train action to improve the operation of the courts, police and custody systems and to provide better legal services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth is prepared to allocate $5 million to the States and Territories to develop and enhance Aboriginal employment strategies in Police Services, custodial and court systems, the further training of police in awareness of  Aboriginal history, culture and disadvantage and to assist in implementing the recommendations of the Royal Commission directed to improving Aboriginal/Police relations. These resources will of course be allocated following consultation with State and Territory Governments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is now an agreed national agenda for reform and improvement in Aboriginal/Police relations following the unanimous support of Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments for the practical proposals for reform proposed by the Royal Commission in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will work with the States, the Territories and the legal profession to develop a cultural awareness program for judges, magistrates and court officers and staff.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will support and fund a national conference, involving Aboriginal community leaders and police, on Aboriginal/Police relations. One of the strong recommendations of the Royal Commission was that jurisdictions would greatly benefit from the exchange of experiences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will also act in our own jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will ensure that the Australian Federal Police will introduce new procedures and initiatives to give effect to the recommendations of the Royal Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will provide $50.4 million over five years through ATSIC for additional support to Aboriginal Legal Services to carry out their crucial responsibilities arising from recommendations of the Royal Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ATSIC will invite Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations to establish supervised Youth Bail Hostels as an alternative to police custody, to reduce the incidence of young people being taken into custody and to provide scope for counselling and for constructive education, training and rehabilitation activity. Funding for this innovative program totals nearly $7 million over five years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consultations will be held with State and Territory Governments on the most effective location and operation of these hostels.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will substantially strengthen the capacity of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to inform Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities about human rights issues and legislation. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission will also work with the National Aboriginal and Islander Legal Services Secretariat to develop an accredited National Aboriginal Legal Service Field Officer Training Course. These initiatives involve $1.97 million over five years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will continue initiatives already announced in the 1991-92 Budget. These include:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;mechanisms for the handling of complaints by Australians under the First Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;better interpreter services for Aboriginal people in Commonwealth courts;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;developing options for Commonwealth racial vilification legislation; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;improved cultural awareness training for the Australian Federal Police.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I remind Honourable Senators that 43 of the 99 people whose deaths the Royal Commission investigated were separated, as children, from their families through intervention by State authorities, missions or other institutions, as were thousands of other Aboriginal children&mdash;until the late 1960s.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is difficult to think of a more damaging experience in the life of a child than to be taken away from his or her family.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Through ATSIC the Commonwealth will provide funding of $1.9 million over five years to enhance the capacity of Link Up services to address unmet demands by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people for assistance in locating and reuniting with their families.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new funding will establish Link Up Services in each of the States and the Northern Territory. Their work will be greatly assisted by the commitment of State and Territory Governments to allow access to records to assist Aboriginal people to be reunited with their families.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I cannot think of any other Commonwealth program which goes more to the very heart of our Government's social justice commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Royal Commission found that alcohol was a factor in the final detention of all of the 99 who died in custody. It is also a major factor in family and community breakdown, domestic violence and unacceptably high incarceration rates among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth will act now to support the efforts of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people themselves to defeat the devastation caused by alcohol and substance abuse.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Through ATSIC and in cooperation with the States and Territories we will provide resources for innovative community-based action to prevent and counter alcohol and substance abuse, especially by young people. Locally initiated and controlled programs will strike at the powerlessness that is at the root of the tragedy being experienced by many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More than $70 million over five years will be provided for this purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These funds will be for specific initiatives which are designed to encourage and support the development of culturally appropriate and community driven solutions to problems resulting from alcohol and substance abuse through:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;programs which empower Aboriginal people to address their substance abuse problems;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;an accessible setting in which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men and women (especially the young) with substance abuse problems can receive treatment, rehabilitation and after-care;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;a capacity to provide trained staff to Aboriginal Health Services and substance abuse organisations which will allow early intervention therapy for clients with substance abuse related problems; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;community based training for substance abuse workers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A good illustration of the determination of Aboriginal people to tackle this major social issue is the Central Australian Grog Strategy developed by Aboriginal people themselves and which draws on models of treatment developed by Canadian Indians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accurate data is essential for monitoring progress. The Commonwealth, through the Australian Bureau of Statistics, will carry out for the first time a National Survey of Aboriginal people. The survey will complement information from the Census and from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Housing Needs and Infrastructure Survey and provide a much improved basis for policy and program decisions by Governments and by Aboriginal organisations themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In cooperation with the States and Territories, we will also support the continuation of data collection and analysis of deaths in custody by the Australian Institute of Criminology.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The total cost of this first package of additional funding measures to tackle the immediate causes of deaths in custody is $150 million over a five year period. The fact that three quarters of this funding will be channelled to community controlled Aboriginal organisations through ATSIC is testimony to the Government's commitment to ATSIC as the vehicle for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander empowerment and self-determination.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I said earlier, Mr President, the Royal Commission found the fundamental cause of the over-representation of Aboriginal people in custody is their unequal and disadvantaged place in Australian life. This is the second  level at which deaths in custody must be tackled.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not enough to work for change only in law and criminal justice areas. We must also make a real attack on the economic and social disadvantage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Governments agree that the Royal Commission's recommendations constitute a charter for action in Aboriginal affairs for years to come.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the Commonwealth's intention, following further negotiations with the States and Territories and further discussion with ATSIC, to announce substantial program initiatives in such areas as education, youth, employment and economic development in a second major statement within three months.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This second package will have a strong focus on economic development, self reliance and self-sufficiency in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities through measures which will produce sustained improvement in economic and social well-being.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be stressed that if, as a result of these and other measures, the rate of imprisonment of Aboriginal people can be reduced to the rate of non-Aboriginal imprisonment there will be a saving to governments of $80 million per annum based on the current costs of maintaining a person in prison.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This second major initiative will require further intergovernmental cooperation. The Commonwealth has already given a commitment to high level and urgent discussions with State and Territory Governments on the need for a national response to the underlying issues. To give effect to this commitment a Commonwealth delegation led by officials of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet will initiate these discussions over the coming weeks. Because of the importance of this second stage of the National Response to the Royal Commission and the necessity for cooperative government action, the Commonwealth believes that the underlying issues identified by the Royal Commission ought to be the subject of discussion at the forthcoming meeting of Heads of Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Prime Minister has stressed, history will judge all governments on their response to the Royal Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the Commonwealth level, we will be proposing, again following close consultation with the ATSIC Board of Commissioners, a carefully targeted, cost-effective approach drawing on the outcome of consultations conducted by ATSIC with Aboriginal people across the country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Report of the Australian Aboriginal Affairs Council on Achieving Greater Co-ordination of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Programs and Services is a basis for further intergovernmental cooperation in redressing Aboriginal disadvantage. The Minister reaffirms the Commonwealth's aim to continue to work within this agreed framework, though he acknowledges that it will take time for detailed arrangements to be put in place, again following extensive consultation and support by Aboriginal people for the initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the documents I have tabled show that Governments have overwhelmingly supported the recommendations of the Royal Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Governments must be held to the undertakings detailed in their responses. This necessarily involves the creation of mechanisms for monitoring implementation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Royal Commission emphasised effective monitoring arrangements. Indeed, they are the subject of its very first recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth will fund ATSIC to carry out this monitoring role, in consultation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and to coordinate Commonwealth monitoring arrangements and consultation with State and Territory Governments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister has been determined to ensure the most open and comprehensive reporting of progress in implementing the Royal Commission's recommendations. The Minister is therefore pleased to announce that, at the Commonwealth level, there will be an annual consolidated report to Parliament on the implementation of the Government's undertakings given in response to the Royal Commission recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ATSIC will be asked to give an account of the extent to which all Commonwealth agencies are meeting their obligations to give effect to Commonwealth support for the recommendations of the Royal Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister understands that the States and Territories intend to make similar arrangements. Cross-tabling arrangements in Commonwealth, State and Territory Parliaments will ensure the greatest public access to this valuable information.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth will work with States and Territories to ensure that all relevant Ministerial and senior officials' forums will give ongoing consideration to the progress of implementation of all Royal Commission recommendations falling within their spheres of interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ATSIC's role will be complemented by an annual State of the Nation report on the human rights situation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to be prepared by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Unit headed by a Commissioner  will be established within the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to undertake  that task.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This annual State of the Nation Report assumes further importance because of the unanimous endorsement by the Commonwealth Parliament of the preamble of the legislation to establish the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation as an essential element in the reconciliation process. The preamble makes the following commitment:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a part of the reconciliation process, the Commonwealth will seek an ongoing national commitment from Governments at all levels to cooperate and to coordinate with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission as appropriate to address progressively Aboriginal disadvantage and aspirations in relation to land, housing, law and justice, cultural heritage, education, employment, health, infrastructure, economic development and any other relevant matters in the decade leading to the centenary of Federation, 2001.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The monitoring mechanism and data-collection processes established in response to the Royal Commission will be of crucial importance in the preparation of the State of the Nation Report and will be supplemented by the extensive information already available to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By providing the annual State of the Nation Report on Aboriginal social justice, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission will be acting as a watchdog over the nation in its achievement of the social justice objective of the process of reconciliation over the coming 9 years leading to the centenary of Federation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I turn to the Royal Commission's support for the reconciliation process which it described as "the fundamental backdrop to reform and change" and for this reason wish to speak about the objectives of the reconciliation process and its integral relationship to government action to give effect to the Royal Commission Response.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation chaired by Mr Patrick Dodson, former Royal Commissioner, was appointed in 1991, following consultation and agreement with the Opposition, the Australian Democrats and the Board of Commissioners of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Council will drive the process of reconciliation at the national level, backed by local and community based initiatives across the country. It will develop strategies for the reconciliation process, and will use the information in the annual State of the Nation report of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission on Aboriginal human rights and social justice, as part of its obligation to foster an ongoing national commitment to redress Aboriginal  disadvantage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In their responses to the Royal Commission all State and Territory Governments have given their support to the process of reconciliation and the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation will be seeking to initiate their active participation in this process over the coming months.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to the social justice objective I have already referred to, the process of reconciliation has two other important objectives which seek to keep faith absolutely with Aboriginal aspirations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, the process seeks to promote an understanding by all Australians of the history, cultures, past dispossession and continuing disadvantage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and of the need to redress that disadvantage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Second, as a part of the reconciliation process the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation will consult with Aboriginal people and the wider community on whether the process of reconciliation would be advanced by a formal document or documents and to make recommendations on the nature and content of any such document.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Council has emphasised that this consultation process must not be rushed and that there are many important issues to be worked through with both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians. While the name of any document has yet to be determined there are far more complex and substantive issues to be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The results of recent public opinion polls show that a very large majority of Australians support a document as one of the outcomes of the reconciliation process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The unanimous support of the Commonwealth Parliament for the process and now the support of State and Territory Governments gives us time to address these important public policy issues for our nation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I conclude this Statement by expressing the Government's gratitude to the Chairperson of ATSIC, Miss Lois O'Donoghue CBE AM, and to the Commissioners for their untiring efforts. All Commissioners were involved in the community consultations and the negotiations which have shaped the Commonwealth's response.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact that the Chairperson with Commissioners Alf Bamblett and Steve Gordon addressed the Cabinet before Ministers considered the Submission on the Government's Response&mdash;Aboriginal people speaking their minds to the highest decision-making body in the Government&mdash;was of great symbolic importance for this country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly to the motion proposed by the Government with respect to amending the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991 and explain what the Government is doing. Honourable senators might recall that this Bill was introduced during the last session and was debated in full. There are a number of important aspects to the Bill and there is no need for that debate to be repeated because we were basically in agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dispute within this chamber related to one issue; that is, the Government's decision to allow the Solicitor-General, whilst on leave, to engage in paid employment. It was our view that in these most unusual circumstances the Government or the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) should be required to set out reasons for this consent being given. We said that in circumstances where there was a particular application of this provision before the chamber&mdash;that was that the Government had given such consent to the present Solicitor-General&mdash;it should be retrospective, so that the Parliament could have before it the reasons pursuant to which the Attorney-General gave this unusual consent. In other words, the reasons for which the Attorney-General said the existing Solicitor-General should be able to take this outside employment should be put before the Parliament. We pressed that issue with Senator Tate in this chamber and with the Attorney-General, in particular, in the other House. The Government refused to give such reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to say that the Australian Democrats agreed with our concerns on this particular issue, as a result of which this clause did not pass in this chamber. The Government in the House of Representatives, in its wisdom, decided not to proceed with the Bill at all. In the meantime, it seems that the Government has reconsidered its position in relation to the existing Solicitor-General. Of course, we are not privy to exactly what went on. The end result is that the Solicitor-General is no longer taking paid employment whilst remaining in an office of the Commonwealth. Therefore, the need to give reasons in relation to his particular instance is no longer present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principle remains, however, that in any such instance in the future the Attorney-General, if he gives such consent, should lay before each House of Parliament, within 15 sitting days after the day on which the consent is given, a written statement of the reasons for the giving of the consent. On reflection, and presumably because the Government has decided on balance that it wants this Bill, it has decided to agree to the very reasonable demand that we have put, except that it has asked that the retrospectivity be deleted. We are happy to accommodate that because it is no longer necessary in relation to the existing Solicitor-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has brought back to us today an amendment which will incorporate within this Bill an obligation upon the Attorney-General pretty much in the terms that I have just stated. In future, where the Attorney-General gives consent to the engaging by the Solicitor-General in the practice of a barrister or solicitor, the Attorney-General is obliged to lay before each House of Parliament, within 15 sitting days after the day on which such consent is given, the reasons for the giving of the consent. Obviously, the Opposition is happy to support that amendment because it is what we argued for when this Bill was last before the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are pleased with the outcome. In the future, not only will justice be done, it will also be seen to be done. In the future, when Attorneys-General exercise this unusual power that they are given and allow those under paid employment of the Commonwealth to go out and engage in private practice on extra remuneration, the Government will have to explain to the people of Australia why it is permitting such practice to be conducted. We are pleased that the Government has capitulated in that regard. We are pleased to support the amendment that the Government has brought back to the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Acting Deputy President, I am sure you will not remember what I was talking about four weeks ago when this debate was adjourned, but I was making various points on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) 1991. I was about to move to the provisions relating to changes in the law about tax deductibility for the restoration of mine sites.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the system that existed before the advent of these amendments, the Act was very ambiguous. It seemed to be very inconsistent about whether restoration of the mine had to be carried out in one piece&mdash;in other words, one total operation&mdash;to be eligible for tax deductibility or whether it could be done over a certain amount of time. Since this measure was introduced to encourage restoration of the environment, there have already been two or three amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Act allowed deduction for the restoration of mine sites, but because of bad drafting the provisions were very ambiguous. On my reading of the legislation, it seemed to me that the mine site had to be restored all in one go. In mining practice that is impossible because restoration of the site actually starts the day mining is started. When an open-cut mine is created, the first practice is to take the topsoil away from the area and stockpile it. That is the first act of restoration. The dumps are created to store the mullock, which  can be loosely defined as material that is not worth processing for the minimal amount of gold that may be in it. The idea is to put topsoil down on the dumps to enable vegetation to grow in it. That vegetation may be planted in the form of creeping salt bush, trees or whatever. Depending on the sort of rainfall there is, those plants can be planted into the dumps. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mullock dumps are created one layer at a time. When the first layer is completed, the topsoil is put down on the sites. It is pointless having a dump about 50 metres high and then expecting the trucks to tip on topsoil which will go all the way down the sides. It just will not work. It has to be an ongoing process. Of course, if topsoil is not put on from the start, it is impossible because of the height of the dump to put it on at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one waits until the end of the life of the mine to conduct restoration, it may be that the mining company has gone somewhere else and there is no-one responsible to carry out the work immediately. This Bill allows for partial on-going restoration of the mine site and tax deductibility will be available along the line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides some relief in respect of substantiation and fringe benefits tax. This arose out of the famous case involving a Minister. I do not think he signed the logbook every day of the week or every time he moved his car, and though the Commissioner did not disbelieve him, it was considered that the person concerned had not taken full recognition of the law. I think it is worthy of comment that the Commissioner, or whoever helped to draft this Bill, has seen some light. Time and time again we have said in this place that substantiation will get harder and harder, especially under self-assessment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My next note on this Bill, a note that I wrote some time ago, had to do with provisional tax. No relief is being given in that area. We dealt with this matter on another Bill last night. I am glad Senator McMullan is in the chamber to hear what I am about to tell him. I have always believed that there should be no uplift factor when we are at the bottom of the worst recession we have had for 60 years. But we have a 10 per cent uplift. It has been included, and taxpayers have the right to vary provisional tax. Of course, taxpayers have to be within 10 per cent correct or they will cop a penalty under section 221YDB of the tax Act. Those penalties have been dished out in Western Australia left, right and centre because of what happened last year in the variations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday Senator McMullan told the Senate how Treasury got the examination of the Fightback package right. Yet it could not get its figures right on any other Estimates, so last night the Senate had before it the Appropriation Bill (No. 5). The Minister then went on to tell me&mdash;and I will give him a chance to apologise&mdash;that we have a 10 per cent uplift factor because the Opposition and the Democrats got together&mdash;and Senator Kernot may remember this&mdash;and forced a 10 per cent uplift. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to remind honourable senators that the amendment the Opposition moved, aided by the Democrats, was that the figure be 10 per cent rather than 12 per cent. If Senator McMullan reads the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> he will see it for himself. The argument was whether the regulation showed between 10 per cent to 12 per cent or 10 per cent. We amended that to fix a ceiling of 10 per cent. The Government wants 10 to 12 per cent. Minister McMullan may like to explain why he misled the Senate on that point last night. If he reads the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and the regulations, he will find that that is so. I repeat that the Opposition set it at 10 per cent, whereas the Government wanted it to stay at a figure of 10 to 12 per cent. I am sure the Democrats will have a bit to say about that later. I am inviting Senator McMullan who is now at the table to tell us why, to take the heat off the Government, he made a misleading statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Treasury is believed to be right when it comes to examining the Fightback package, but is not expected to be right when it gives us Forward Estimates before appropriations. Taxpayers in calculating provisional tax are expected to be within the category of 10 per cent accuracy. I was also told by the Minister that the power was in the hands of the Commissioner of Taxation. Therefore, I suggest that perhaps the Commissioner be responsible for running Treasury. We might then get some sense injected into this field and be provided with the right sorts of forecasts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, I believe that this Bill was far too late for the reasons I have already pointed out, especially in bringing into being the measures on the new depreciation schedule. That schedule was not announced in the One Nation package, it was not announced last November, but was announced in the March 1991 statement. Here we are getting the schedule 13 months later. Any plant bought after March 1991 will attract three lots of depreciation. The Government originally said that the depreciation schedules announced in March 1991 would come into action on 1 July 1991. But after pressure was applied by industry and machinery dealers, the Government agreed to go back to 12 March 1991. Any machinery bought at that time will attract three lots of depreciation by the time we are finished. This Bill was very late and parts of it were necessary to fix up sloppy drafting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not got the time to go into much further detail about the depreciation schedules. They will be in operation for only a matter of six months before the new ones come into action. At Question Time Senator Button tells us time and time again how this new depreciation schedule will help industry. As I said last night on another Bill, the only thing the new schedule has done is to cut down the 30-year write-off to seven years. A 30-year write-off was hardly ever felt because, after the first three or four years, inflation took away any benefit one may have enjoyed. With shorter periods of two, three, five and seven years, depreciation remains very much the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the Government had to bring this Bill in to fix up its mistakes. There is one more Bill in line and one more around the corner to fix up further mistakes. If the Government wants to start pinching parts of our Fightback package, it should take the whole lot and put it into action. With that, it might be able to turn Australia around. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1991 was the last omnibus taxation Bill to be introduced during 1991. As is the usual practice, this piece of legislation has been held over until the beginning of the Autumn sittings. When enacted, it will become the Tax Laws Amendment Act 1992. The issues in this Bill are numerous and extremely wide-ranging, and it will take me quite a while to deal with them. The legislation is to be referred to a legislative committee after the second reading, so I guess we can expect some amendments to arise from the more detailed consideration that the Bill will receive by that committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before considering what we regard to be the major aspects of the Bill, I would like to mention the fringe benefit tax amendments which are proposed. We should commend the Government for proposing these amendments which flow directly from the previous work of this chamber and that of Senator Watson in particular. The question of totally unfair and inflexible substantiation rules&mdash;that is, the rules which prescribe the types of records and documentation which must be kept by taxpayers&mdash;was thrust into the public debate after the correct, but what was seen as the manifestly unfair, decision in the Evangelist's case. A private senator's Bill was prepared by Senator Watson and was passed with Democrat support. The Government acted quickly to remedy the situation. The Government is now proposing a similar discretion to disregard technical breaches of the fringe benefits tax substantiation provisions. These amendments have the full support of the Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major issue to be dealt with in this Bill is the issue of depreciation. The former Prime Minister's industry statement of March 1991 announced proposed changes to the business depreciation regime, and it has taken a year for this matter to finally come before the Senate. The absurdity of this is now compounded by the fact that these rules have already been superseded by the recent economic statement of the new Prime Minister (Mr Keating), but still we press on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The original announcement proposed to legislate to clarify the meaning of the `effective life of plant'; to permit taxpayers to self-assess the rate of depreciation; to reduce the number of rate classes for depreciation from 18 to seven broad-banded rate classes; to allow taxpayers to pool items within a rate class to simplify the administrative burden of the existing system; and to permit items with a value of less than $300, or with a life of three years or less, to be deductible immediately to reduce the accounting costs for these small items. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new depreciation arrangements, other than the pooling and broad banding, were to have applied to assets acquired or first held ready for use after 1 July 1991. Broad banding and pooling commenced on 1 July 1991 for all assets except those which are eligible for the previous accelerated depreciation which was axed by Mr Keating whilst he was Treasurer. Perhaps the best summary of these measures was provided in Tim Dodd's article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> the next day when he stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More flexibility and simplicity was introduced into tax depreciation in yesterday's Industry Statement, but the significantly accelerated depreciation rates sought by business were not delivered.</PARA>
<PARA>Subsequently, industry negotiated with the Tax Office and the Treasury on the details of the proposals. There were some unclear matters, in particular, the question of whether the effective life of a piece of equipment should be determined according to the intentions of the original purchaser or by some more objective criteria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, where a company proposes to purchase a photocopier for intensive use over, say, two years and then sell it, the industry interpreted the Government's original statement and the Tax Office's initial explanatory pamphlet on the matter, to be unequivocal. The company could have depreciated the item, using an effective life of two years, and then disposed of it, with any sale proceeds being included in assessable income or used as a balancing charge on a new item of equipment. But the Tax Office decided to delete the reference to the taxpayer, thereby arguing that the objective effective life should be used, thus spreading the depreciation deductions allowable over a longer period and then allowing a balancing claim only at the time the item was sold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This led to the claim that government officials were undermining the intention of the Government's announcement. Indeed, Senator Watson raised this matter in Estimates committee hearings last year.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, in this saga, on 26 September 1991, the then Treasurer, Mr Kerin, released the final details of the effective life arrangements. Business was generally happy with the revised arrangements as they included the option for a taxpayer to depreciate an item of plant on the basis of the taxpayer's circumstance of use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, when the legislation was finally released, it was still deficient. The current Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, the fourth to have been involved in the preparation of this Bill&mdash;maybe that is some sort of record&mdash;had to issue a press release on 25 February 1992 announcing two further amendments, which Senator McMullan will presumably speak to. The purposes of these amendments were, firstly, to clarify that taxpayers may use the Commissioner's advisory rates if they so decide; and, secondly, to clarify a technical change relating to the treatment of second-hand goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Kerin also announced that because of representations from the business community the new rates would apply to assets purchased after the industry statement was made&mdash;that is, 12 March 1991&mdash;but before 1 July 1991, but only in respect of depreciation claims from 1 July 1991. The original announcement also specified that taxpayers who elected to apply self-assessed rates which differed from the Commissioner's advisory rates would have to indicate this choice on the front of their tax return. This requirement was criticised and was reversed by the Government on the condition that relevant documentation as to why a particular depreciation rate was adopted is kept by taxpayers for a possible future audit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The broad banding arrangements were also modified by allowing a 20 per cent loading on all assets which were not eligible for the former 5 : 3 depreciation regime, and by making the adoption of the broad banding optional, as there were some circumstances where taxpayers could have been disadvantaged because of the administrative effort required for them to comply. Furthermore, the Government also agreed that the $300 immediate expensing limit is to be annually reviewed by government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this stage I would like to flag an amendment which I will be moving in the committee stage of this Bill. We see that there is an anomaly in the immediate expensing regime which this amendment of ours is designed to remedy. The decision to grant a legislative basis for all taxpayers regarding immediate expensing is a positive step. We support that initiative. But we think that the Government's proposals fail to take into account the effect of income tax ruling IT 2264 which has been in effect since early 1986. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This ruling, which does not have the force of law but which does govern the practice of the Commissioner, provides a $500, not a $300, limit for immediate expensing of items used by companies, excluding leasing companies, but not by individuals. We see this as an anomaly. We will be moving an amendment to increase the $300 proposed limit to $500. Why should tax law benefit corporate taxpayers relative to individual small business people? Why should big business be additionally favoured over small business? I hope that the Opposition, which always professes concern about the burden of paperwork on small business, will agree to this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Mr Kerin announced these measures, it was reported that they were going to cost $100m in 1992-93. Since then, I think he said something to the effect that the new rules could cost far more than the nominal $100m now estimated as the cost to revenue. But we still find the cost depreciation provisions in the financial impact statement in the explanatory memorandum to be $100m. So I ask for clarification. Does there need to be an adjustment of those figures, or did Mr Kerin get it wrong?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time these measures were announced, the Government was concerned about their cost. The then Treasurer, Mr Keating, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government does not believe that assets should be written off faster at an even higher budgetary cost.</PARA>
<PARA>But less than 12 months later we have the same man completely reversing his position and introducing a further modification to the depreciation regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the bias against long term productive investment is to be removed, with a further acceleration of the depreciation of assets with an effective life in excess of five</PARA>
<PARA>years that are acquired on or after 27 February 1992. This reconsideration of the issue arises from the persistent efforts of Senator Button, who established a business taxation review within government last year. This new regime will allow assets with effective lives of 10 and 20 years to be fully depreciated after six and 7 1/2 years respectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just to keep the Government's record intact, after the One Nation statement the Treasurer announced further changes to the newly announced regime by way of press release No. 42. Taxpayers will be able to continue to depreciate plant and equipment on a prime cost basis. The rate will be two-thirds the declining balance rate for each of the six effective life asset classes. This will be rounded to the nearest whole number. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new legislation will allow taxpayers to depreciate assets at rates which are lower than those now allowed, if the taxpayers so choose. So, after all that, let us hope that the Government has finally got it right. But we still think we can point to some long standing problems which need to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An anomaly has been drawn to my attention concerning the scope of the depreciation provisions. Only plant or articles, as defined by section 54 of the assessment Act, qualify for depreciation, although other deductions are allowed for other capital expenses, such as tourist accommodation, buildings and some primary production expenditure. The One Nation statement also proposes to extend the types of tourist related structural improvements that can be written off. I mention these just to illustrate that, in our opinion, the existing capital allowances are still deficient in some respects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The anomaly that I am referring to is the treatment of the expenses of planting fruit trees. Currently, the expenses of planting new orchards are not tax deductible to primary producers. Neither is the expense&mdash;which I agree is a capital expense&mdash;allowed under any of the capital allowance provisions. So the only tax relief available to an orchardist is a capital loss when the trees have reached the end of their useful life. Even then, no relief from income tax is allowed&mdash;only relief from the capital gains tax liability, if one exists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further anomaly arises when an existing orchard is purchased by a primary producer. Even though the trees may be fully mature and have a finite production life&mdash;that is, their value depreciates&mdash;no depreciation is allowable for income tax purposes. Under some circumstances, a capital loss may be allowable when the trees have reached the end of their useful life, but this is only where a separate value can be put on the trees. Again, it is only allowable to offset against a capital gain liability. So, clearly, some anti-avoidance provisions will be necessary to stop the generation of unwarranted deductions by the transfer of legal ownership of a mature orchard whilst the beneficial ownership is unchanged. But we do not think this affects the validity of the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should ask why a distinction is made between machines, which have a finite useful life, and trees, which also have a finite useful life. The products produced by both are important to this nation. Most people would agree that a competitive taxation regime assists in keeping Australian industries world competitive, be they primary or secondary industries. Currently, fruit tree growers are clearly at a disadvantage. We should do something to redress that. I intend to write to farming bodies about this issue. I expect the National Party to give some interest to this issue when the amendments come before the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are constantly told that simplification in the taxation area is high on the Government's agenda. This is a classic example of a much greater complexity being introduced because of inadequate and fragmented policy. I just hope that this new regime will be left to operate without further changes once the additional measures, just announced by the Prime Minister, and maybe the suggestions I have made, come into force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Various other matters are contained in this Bill. There is the belated enactment of some balancing adjustment roll-over relief provisions which were supposedly announced on 8 December 1990. Senator Watson has already pointed out that this was not the case. I am aware that an extraordinary and tragic event caused the confusion but, when announcing prospective legislative intent, the Government must be as flawless as possible. In this case it was not. These provisions ensure that the depreciation system and the capital gains tax regime are complementary. Obviously, the Democrats do not oppose that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Still in the area of depreciation, there are also some anti-avoidance measures which correct a technical deficiency in the existing law. Ordinarily, where assets are sold for an amount in excess of their written down value, that excess is taxable as income. However, assets can be disposed of to a related company and then sold off, thereby realising the gain and not having to pay capital gains tax, nor having the proceeds treated as a recoupment of prior depreciation claims. This anomaly is addressed in the legislation before us. It appears that this is the provision which Senator Panizza, in his speech, claimed is redundant because of the capital gains tax. I am sure that Senator McMullan will clarify that as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised that there is a loophole because a related company is not liable to pay any tax on depreciation recoupment where an asset is sold for more than its depreciated value. It is not liable to capital gains tax because, for the purposes of the capital gains tax, the asset is deemed to have been acquired by the related company at market price. So when this is then sold, no capital gains tax liability arises. This is the loophole which is addressed by the amendment. I submit that such an arrangement should constitute a scheme for the purposes of part 4A of the assessment Act. Perhaps Senator McMullan could explain why, instead of more legislation being introduced, the Commissioner could not have pursued that line to deal with these arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also two proposals to amend capital gains tax provisions. Firstly, an anti-avoidance measure is contained in clause 51 of the Bill. This provision is aimed at ensuring that the legislation operates as originally intended. Unwarranted benefits will accrue to some taxpayers if this anomaly is allowed to continue, so the Democrats will support this measure. The second capital gains tax measure is a simple administrative one which substitutes the responsibility for publishing the indexation factors from the Treasurer to the Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter covered by the Bill is deductibility of mine site rehabilitation expenses. The industry has raised some technical questions which the Government is clarifying with these amendments. The Democrats do not oppose the alteration of the law to allow a deduction for rehabilitation expenses which are incurred by the mining company whilst mining operations are still proceeding. Indeed, this would tend to indicate an immediate rehabilitation plan is being implemented by the mine operator, which would generally be a good thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there is ambiguity in the policy proposal in the Bill with respect to the allowance of deductions for expenses for partial site restoration. The Democrats believe that any mine site must be fully restored after it is exploited. Consequently, any proposal which grants tax relief to partial or inadequate rehabilitation is bad public policy and should be opposed. That is not to say that we are opposed to allowing a deduction for partial rehabilitation as it occurs as long as the total plan is to completely rehabilitate the site. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the proposed amendment&mdash;clause 43 of the Bill&mdash;specifically states that a deduction is to be granted even if the taxpayer has no intention of completing the restoration. What sort of policy is this for a Government which is supposed to be committed to sustainable development? The Government is saying, `Well, you go ahead and mine an area and if you don't want to return it to the same condition, or even a reasonable approximation of the original condition, then that's fine&mdash;you do what you want and we'll give you a tax deduction for it'. The Democrats oppose this approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ESD working group on mining issued its final report in November 1991. The Government has still not responded to any of these reports.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are numerous other matters in this Bill. There are some technical changes to the foreign source income provisions and to the Australia-Fiji double tax treaty. Perhaps the most alarming measure is another anti-avoidance amendment which concerns the tax treatment of foreign exchange gains and losses. The explanatory memorandum summarises the proposal as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will ensure that a deduction for a foreign exchange loss of a capital nature on a contract will be reduced by a gain on an underlying, hedging of other contract if that gain is not included in assessable income.</PARA>
<PARA>We should ask why this obvious loophole was not specifically dealt with at the time the Government decided to extend the concession of allowing exchange rate losses on capital account to be treated in the same manner as exchange rate losses on revenue account. How much money has this particular oversight cost the Australian community?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also provides some technical and anti-avoidance amendments to the research and development deduction provisions and further modifications to the tax file number system. But I will not go into those because I want to comment on two remaining areas covered by the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, the issue of tax avoidance and trading stock has arisen again. The trading stock provisions were enormously abused during the golden age of tax avoidance, the sixties and seventies. The judgments by the Barwick High Court in the Curran and Wesfarmers cases, to name but two, were both legendary and, I would argue, disgraceful. Although those and other decisions could also be attributed to the philosophy of the judiciary at the time, the recent decision in the Raymor case shows that there are still problems in the income tax legislation in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An income tax deduction is properly allowable when a taxpayer purchases trading stock. However, there must be a reversal of this deduction in respect of unsold stock at the end of the year, otherwise businesses could definitely defer paying any income tax by purchasing large amounts of trading stock at the end of every financial year. The tax law has long recognised this necessity to match income and expenses, and section 28 of the assessment Act attempts to do this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, section 28 refers to stock on hand at the close of the year. It is possible, in certain circumstances, to circumvent the intention of section 28. Examples are forward purchase contracts of goods and, in some circumstances, goods in transit. This Bill proposes to remedy this anomaly by altering the general deduction provision to bring it into line with the wording in section 28. It is such a pity that people seek to find these loopholes and avoid them. Nevertheless, that is the way people operate and, consequently, we are always catching up. The Australian Democrats support this overdue reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter is the question of the availability of dividend rebates. The Bill provides a retrospective amendment back to 1976 to overcome the decision in the Patcorp case. This is a very strange situation because the Commission adopted as practice the allowing of dividend rebates as contemplated in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter was forgotten until the Commissioner decided to apply the law, not his usual practice, to the Adelaide Steamship group of companies. We then had the ironic role reversal of very sophisticated taxpayers arguing that the Commissioner should not apply the law and the Commissioner reversing his usual practice. The amendment is retrospective but does not apply to assessments already made. Therefore, this decision does not aid any taxpayer against whom the Commissioner has already applied the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to finish this lengthy explanation by paying credit to the Taxation Office officials for producing an excellent, user-friendly explanatory memorandum.

However, the Poultry Levy Collection Act and the principal Act continue to operate to allow the collection of late payments and the recovery of outstanding debts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal Act established the Poultry Industry Trust Fund, known as `the Fund', into which an appropriation of Commonwealth funding equates the amount collected by way of levy under the Poultry Industry Levy Collection Act of 1965.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While indicating support for the meat inspection and poultry aspects of the legislation&mdash;and in particular, for that part of the legislation which deals with our natural water resources and the National Water Resources (Financial Assistance) Act 1978&mdash;I would like to take the opportunity to skirt the issue of our water resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are told that the amendments to the National Water Resources (Financial Assistance) Act 1978 are designed to improve the efficiency of its administration in three respects. Quite understandably, there is general support for simplifying the administration by placing the requirements of the Act under the responsibility of one Minister. This seems eminently logical. It also seems logical to make the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory eligible to receive assistance under the Act. But that leads me to what seems to be one of the fundamental problems in the administration of our inland waters in particular. It seems to me that a huge component of our water problems is the very fact that our States and Territories are self-governing and have different policies, attitudes and strategies for properly managing our water resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That situation is extremely well illustrated by the recent problems we have had with the Murray-Darling catchment and the algal bloom. The responsibility to act on that problem was a matter of some discussion and some inertia in terms of dealing with the problem. Any government really, whether State, Territory or Federal, which recognises the urgency of correctly managing our water resources, might well do a little more than dissipate the legislative opportunity or at least the Executive opportunity to deal with water problems. It would probably come up with strategies to recognise the need&mdash;as was expressed by Dr Mike Synnot of Curtin University&mdash;to establish a national water quality standard to ensure the quality of our water supply as well as the quantity. Such a strategy would at least recognise the different requirements of our water users. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Immediately apparent to anybody who has ever been involved with local government&mdash;I just recently finished my involvement with it&mdash;is that, in most of our cities, as those who are responsible for administering the supply of reticulated water would be well aware, usually less than 5 per cent of the water which is supplied for domestic use needs to be of potable water quality. That which is used for flushing toilets, watering gardens, washing cars and myriad other uses has no requirement to be of a potable, drinking, cooking standard. The immense cost to our community of supplying that reticulated water to such a standard is really something we should be addressing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will accept Senator Panizza's interjection. No, not necessarily double reticulation. But Senator Panizza would surely be familiar with the situation that obtains in many of our country towns in Australia whereby water that is used for drinking is, in fact, either tank water or provided from another source, even carted water; whereas the reticulated water is seldom fit for drinking&mdash;and perhaps that is a blessing because it is then not wasted. I would not suggest that the situation is one which we should repeat in our capital cities, but the alternatives are there and should be considered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To supply 95 per cent of our water at a potable standard to be flushed down the toilet or to be flung at the prized possessions of people in their driveways is a pretty inefficient way to run the water resources of the country. As a quick example, one with which I am familiar, in our second driest capital city&mdash;that is Hobart&mdash;out of a budget of something less than $50m, the Hobart City Council spends up to $5m on the supply of reticulated water. That is the cost involved in just purchasing it from the Hobart Metropolitan Water Board; it does not cover the cost of repairs, maintenance and new extensions. So it is a matter of some considerable importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any government which recognised the need to become involved in formulating a strategy to consider properly our water supply in Australia, would also recognise the characteristics of water supply in Australia, including the fact that much of our inland rural land depends upon using water which has already been used upstream. Consequently, the ecological interrelationship of water, soil, flora and fauna would be recognised. Because of that, we would need to encourage State and local governments to undertake the necessary capital works for the standardisation of quality regulation and any other measures that are necessary to complement the national strategies. I am not suggesting that nobody has ever thought of this. I am not suggesting for one moment that this is being ignored by the Federal Government or our State and regional governments. But what I am suggesting is that we need to bring on that debate a little more quickly in this national forum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was disappointed with the contribution that Mr Lloyd made when this Bill was receiving its second reading in the lower House. A considerable part of Mr Lloyd's contribution was to gloss over&mdash;and I say that advisedly, not in the pejorative sense; I think it is an accurate description of what was being done&mdash;the problems associated with water supply in the Murray-Darling Basin. I quote in part from his speech. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One has to note that at the time of the outbreak&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>speaking of the algal bloom outbreak last summer&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">there was a drought and dry weather exacerbates the likelihood of algal outbreaks because the river drops to lower level . . .</PARA>
<PARA>True. That does not remove in any way the alarm experienced by those who rely for their livelihood on that river upon seeing that they had absolutely no capacity to deal with the problem themselves. When they turned to any authority that may have been able to do something about it, they found a confusion of authorities and, as I indicated before, a paralysis which discouraged effective and efficient reaction&mdash;not that there was anything much that any of the authorities could do in the immediate sense. It was the advent of well-timed rains which actually resolved the problem. The release of water to encourage flow from dams upstream was an opportunity which had been reduced by the very fact that there was a drought. So it is a problem which should not be glossed over. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also in Mr Lloyd's contribution in the lower House was a suggestion that agricultural producers on the Darling really did not use a lot of fertiliser; that the towns located on the Darling, which had sewerage plants releasing their product into the Murray or the Darling, were not really to blame and that industries also had outputs into this area. I think it was a sort of collection of apologies and excuses rather than an encouragement&mdash;as it should be and as I would like my contribution today to be seen as&mdash;for people, for authorities and for anybody who has any capacity to make any decisions at all with regard to our Murray-Darling Basin, to find a reason to treat this matter seriously and to recognise the importance of this huge natural Australian resource. </PARA>

It will try to find a process which considers all points of view, minimises conflict and is as fair as possible. That at least is a recognition of the fact that in Australia, water&mdash;its use and allocation&mdash;is particularly important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to think that because of the small step the Government is taking in this legislation, it may take the opportunity to recognise how important it is to deal properly with our water and take into consideration the efforts of many Australians who have for decades taken pains to illustrate how important it is. A wonderful contributor to our water management skills has been mentioned in this place before, the famous Australian Ernest Jackson, who is known as Ernest `Watershed' Jackson. He is typical of a number of Australian pioneers in the proper management of our ecological resources, and someone whose contribution should be given much more credibility than the contributions made by so many people which gloss over the urgency of this problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that this legislation at least takes a small step along the way towards recognising what a significant problem we have. The Australian Democrats will be supporting the other components of the legislation.

It amends the Meat Inspection Act 1983, the National Water Resources (Financial Assistance) Act 1978, the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967 and the Wheat Marketing Act 1989.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Act allows the Australian Wheat Board to delay the submission of its corporate plan to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy until 1 September, which is closer to the Australian Wheat Board's financial year, which commences on 1 October and finishes on 30 September of each year. This is a very sensible financial year for the Australian wheat industry. The amendment will also allow for the Australian Wheat Board's operational plan to be in the hands of the Minister until 1 October and will line up with that financial year. These measures are necessary and will not generate much debate in this place. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I come to that, I wish to remind everyone that next Thursday is Wool Day in Australia. This has been ably put together by my colleague Mr Wilson Tuckey, the honourable member for O'Connor in the other place, assisted by the honourable member for Stirling and Deputy Speaker, Mr Ronald Edwards. I am sure that the Australian wool industry is coming out of its downturn. I know there is a long way to go in the wool industry, but I can see light at the end of the tunnel. The wool display and auction taking place in the Great Hall is a good exhibition and will certainly show to Canberra and the rest of Australia the importance of wool to this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, that is right. It is a pity that when this Parliament House was opened in 1988 the Australian Wool Corporation did not take up the invitation to put on a fashion parade. It does this very well throughout Australia&mdash;working in shearing sheds and all over the place&mdash;but ignored this opportunity. It shows what the Wool Corporation's priorities were at the time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Primary industry is going through a tough period. The prices are bad enough without this Government's economic mismanagement. During the last planting year wheat attracted low prices, but fortunately they have improved out of sight. We were expecting $120 a tonne when we planted the latest crop in 1991-92, but we finished up with approximately $180 a tonne. That has turned around the wheat industry very successfully. The price of wool is starting to creep up, even though it has a long way to go. Although the market indicator has reduced by some 75 cents a kilo in the last six weeks, hopefully the price is holding, judging by the trend shown at the end of last week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last couple of days we have heard a lot about tariff reform and reforms in different industries. Unfortunately, the Government looked firstly at primary industries, then at secondary industries and thirdly at the transport industries to match those reforms. These reforms are not forthcoming, although every day Senator Collins espouses waterfront reforms in the Senate. There may have been reforms on the waterfront, but any savings are certainly not flowing through to the people who use the waterfront, that is, the importers and exporters. Ask them. In the last 12 months the cost of getting containers or other produce across the wharves in Sydney and Melbourne has increased by 20 per cent. There have been none of the savings on the waterfront that there have been in primary industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During Question Time we got a lecture from Senator Button on the lack of tariff reform by the Fraser Government. He outlined what this Government has been doing, until three days ago, concerning tariff reform. That was until the Wills by-election and Prime Minister Keating has certainly changed his direction on tariffs. Senator Button said that the Government was cutting tariff protection down and down. Yet, last December he chose to agree without any debate in this place&mdash;and it will be debated before very long&mdash;to slap a $12,000 tariff on imported used cars, even though a company to import second-hand Mazda 626 motor vehicles is ready to be set up in order to meet the ADR. There will be quite a lot of debate on that $12,000 tariff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet the Government has always said&mdash;and I agree&mdash;that the pineapple growers of Queensland, the banana growers, the pea growers, et cetera cannot have tariffs and must compete with the rest of the world. It said that the dairy industry also had to stand on its own feet and compete. We have had to put up with strong competition from New Zealand under the closer economic relations guidelines. Primary industries have accepted that the world of tariffs has passed them by, but it is certainly not extending to the rest of the industries. I am very disappointed that Senator Button has agreed to that $12,000 tariff. If there is to be reform, it should be for all Australians so that primary industries can compete with other industries in Australia and the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must move towards a better economic climate for primary industry. We have been told that interest rates have come down considerably in the last 12 months. That may have happened in certain areas, but when it comes to farmers borrowing money, lower interest rates have not been quite so forthcoming. As we are to adjourn at 6 p.m., I will conclude my remarks at this point. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Due to important domestic commitments I will not be attending the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development to be held in Brazil in June 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Australian delegation to the Conference will be led by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories, the Hon Ros Kelly MP. The Minister for Resources, the Hon Alan Griffiths MP, and the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, the Hon John Kerin MP, are also likely to attend. The size and composition of the full delegation will be subject to finalisation closer to the event. It has not been decided at this stage exactly how many staff members or officials will be included in the delegation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been initial discussions about arrangements for other organisations, environment or business, to attend the Conference, but no final decisions have been made. An important factor in deciding the size of the Australian delegation will be the facilities made available to governments by the Brazilian authorities and by the UN Conference organisers. The Brazilian Government has made it clear that space will be limited for each delegation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been no discussions held or commitments given concerning possible government funding for other organisations in relations to the Conference. It is not normal practice for the Government to fund the attendance of representatives of non-government organisations who are included in Australian delegations to international conferences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) It is not possible at this time to determine the full costs of attending the Conference.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Department's policy is to follow the information privacy principles in the Privacy Act 1988 and to ensure that staff know about and comply with them and the confidentiality provisions in the Social Security Act 1991, the secrecy provisions in the Crimes Act 1914 and relevant Public Service Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) A training package has been developed for privacy training for all staff. Privacy issues are also covered in other training modules and are an important element of many other technical training programs for regional office staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Privacy is an integral part of induction training for all recruits and training for public contact staff. The Privacy Contact officers in the Department also carry out some on-going training and information sessions on privacy issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The integration of privacy issues within many training modules means precise identification of the staff time involved is not possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) 82,221 payments were cancelled in the last twelve months as a result of departmentally initiated review activity. Some people may have been subject to more than one cancellation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The main reasons for cancellation of various payments were:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">failure to lodge a review or continuation form</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">fit for work</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) Since the Department does not know the names of most of the AIDEX protesters it is not possible to answer the question. Of those known to have participated in the protest, 37 have been interviewed or interviews have been attempted. At this stage it is intended to interview one other person. Some protesters who were social security recipients voluntarily relinquished payments. This seems to have occurred as part of the ordinary course of events where people on Job Search Allowance obtain work or undertake studies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) The Secretary of the Department asked the Privacy, Fraud and Control Division if names and addresses of those arrested could be obtained. This was against the background that one of the AIDEX protesters publicly suggested that he, and, by implication, other protesters were engaged regularly in protest activities rather than seeking employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An approach to the Australian Federal Police (AFP) in writing was made by the AFP liaison officer in the Area South-West Office in NSW, asking if names and addresses could be provided. This followed discussions between the Privacy, Fraud and Control Division in the Department's National Administration and the AFP liaison officer. The approach was made as an initial step in reviewing the continuing eligibility for Social Security payments. Information Privacy Principle 11 permits disclosure of information where it is reasonably necessary for the protection of the public revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) There is no regular liaison because the Department is not concerned with involvement in protest action per se. However, involvement in some protest actions or other activities can be of a duration or type which is incompatible with continuing eligibility for social security payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) The Department has information about Australia's obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). The key obligation for Departmental staff concerns the right to privacy. Relevant information is disseminated in staff training as outlined in (2) above.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) The reviews were conducted following allegations that AIDEX demonstrators might not be eligible for social security payments. It is the Department's general policy to conduct reviews where there are allegations of non-eligibility for social security payments and the policy was applied in this case. The demonstrators were not treated any differently from other persons about whom allegations are made. On this basis the reviews do not contravene Australia's obligations under the ICCPR. This has been confirmed by the Attorney-General's Department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(10) The nature of review depends on the nature of the allegation and the information supplied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It can include verification of information with third parties (eg seeking income details from an employer).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all but unusual cases, there is an interview with the recipient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(11) There is no minimum number of allegations prescribed in the way suggested.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where any allegation has sufficient details to enable follow up and is obviously not ill founded or made in bad faith, a review will be conducted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is necessary to maintain public confidence in the integrity of the Social Security system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As indicated above, in all but unusual cases (eg the person is overseas or major fraud could be involved) the client concerned will be interviewed by Department of Social Security staff and given the opportunity to comment on the matters raised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department is conscious that, while cases must be adequately reviewed, many public denunciations prove to be unfounded and care is needed in undertaking reviews.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If any decision affecting payment is made there are extensive rights of appeal on the merits available (Authorised Review Officers, the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also avenues of complaint about the manner in which the Department has acted (in particular to the Ombudsman and the Privacy Commissioner).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(12) Some reviews are still in progress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this stage payments to four of the people concerned have been stopped.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In cases where the review has concluded that payments should be continued, the recipients are being treated in the same way as other recipients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A final point is that, in a small number of cases, reviews were, or are, being conducted independently of the action referred to in this question and answer.</PARA>
