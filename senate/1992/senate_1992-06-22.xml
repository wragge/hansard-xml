<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. I refer the Minister to Mr Beazley's comments yesterday regarding the Prime Minister's proposed youth summit to be held next month when he said he was not absolutely certain how the summit would operate or whether the teenage jobless would be represented, and not sure whether the summit would be a public forum, despite the fact that the Prime Minister plans to announce details of that summit tomorrow. Has the Minister or Mr Beazley been consulted on the Prime Minister's plans for a youth summit next month or is Mr Beazley's lack of knowledge on Government policy just another example, as today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> says, of a government reduced to the frenetic decision making of one man, the Prime Minister, Mr Keating?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The summit was announced by the Prime Minister on 3 June at the `Lighten the Load' forum on youth unemployment. It has received, I might say, a very positive response from many quarters, the youth sector in particular. The Australian of the Year, Archbishop Hollingworth, gave it a good rap and social workers and others have also praised the initiative. Young people, business, unions, community groups and other leaders in the field will be invited to the summit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Campbell asks whether we have been consulted. The summit has been under consideration within the Government but, as Senator Campbell knows, it is not a fair question to ask a Minister what happens within the processes of Cabinet or of Cabinet committees. Those matters are, of course, fairly confidential; so I do not propose, should Senator Campbell's incubating supplementary question be, `What was discussed?', to go into that matter. These matters have been considered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government does have a number of proposals that it wishes to canvass for the youth summit. We are keen to hear what key groups in the community have to say about long term solutions for youth unemployment. In particular, we are interested in hearing from business about what role it can play in training young people for new jobs and jobs that will come out of the restructuring we have undertaken in the economy when industrial growth takes a stronger hold. We will be concentrating on positive things and constructive measures in dealing with youth unemployment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Contrary to the Minister's implication about the incubation of a supplementary question, my concern is about the lack of incubation of policy on the side of the Government. The Prime Minister seems to be dropping unincubated eggs on the run. My supplementary question relates to Mr Beazley's seemingly total lack of knowledge on how this youth jobless summit will take place. As Mr Beazley is the Minister who is directly responsible for teenage unemployment, the question really is: was Mr Beazley included in talks with the Prime Minister and the ACTU last Friday regarding the youth summit?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have answered the last part of the supplementary question but the first part of the original question as it is now rephrased. I am somewhat taken by surprise by Senator Campbell's statements that he is interested in improving the lot of young people in this country. I am taken by surprise because that marks him down as a Liberal who does not support the Fightback package. The consumption tax package, we all know, involves kicking people off the dole after nine months. That is hardly a constructive measure to deal with people who are in the hardship of unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consumption tax package, we all know, involves the abolition of the CES and the youth access centres.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also know that under the Fightback package&mdash;the consumption tax package as it is more accurately called&mdash;TAFE is to be downgraded. The Opposition will provide $75m in grants to TAFE. In the One Nation statement we provide $720m. So let us mark on the scales of fairness the Opposition's $75m and our $720m.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are some ironies in politics. Were this not a serious matter, one could indulge oneself in the sense of irony that arises when the Housing Industry Association advertises in New South Wales against the independent contractors legislation of the Government when our legislation is in fact a more narrowly drawn version of the existing Greiner Government legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where, for example, are the HIA's advertisements calling on the Greiner Government to do what it more generously does for independent contractors than that which we do? Where is it being fair and even-handed about the so-called and alleged injustice of our legislation when it simply concentrates on us and says nothing whatsoever about where we drew inspiration in the first place&mdash;from the Greiner Government legislation on the statute book in New South Wales now for at least a decade?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is nothing that approaches truth in the Housing Industry Association advertisement. Perhaps the more startling revelation is that it has established a $5m fund to campaign and is soliciting donations for this $5m fund. I say to all Australians: do not be duped; do not fall for the confidence trick; and do not accept the lies and deceit inherent in the HIA's advertisement and contribute to this fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Aulich asks me: who are the other industry groups? The other industry groups are the Confederation of Australian Industry, the Business Council of Australia, the Master Builders Association, the Metal Trades Industry Association and the Chamber of Manufactures. They are the other groups, along with this Government, that are being attacked by the HIA about getting the facts wrong. It could well be&mdash;but it would take an extraordinary leap of imagination to believe it&mdash;that the rest of the world is wrong and the HIA is right. But one has only to have resort to the black letter of the Bill to see that the HIA is wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> today, a letter from Mr John Murray, the Executive Director of the Master Builders Association, was published which makes that point very explicitly. I conclude my answer by quoting from the letter by John Murray. The letter says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill now retains only a limited provision allowing the Industrial Relations Commission to review individual harsh and unconscionable contracts at the request of the contractor involved&mdash;a provision similar to, but narrower than, those which already exist in NSW, SA and Queensland industrial legislation, and which have been operating for some years without any ill effects.</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise `without any ill-effects'. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Master Builders Association&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">do not believe that these provisions will increase housing costs&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>my emphasis&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and it would be most unfortunate if cost increases were imposed on the public using this legislation as an excuse. Master Builders-CHAA will certainly be recommending to its members that they do not need to make any allowance for extra costs on the basis of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>The last sentence reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We remain convinced that this legislation is not needed in the building industry, but after legal advice we are convinced that the amendments we secured will spare home owners a price hike such as we had originally feared.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the Master Builders-Construction and Housing Association Australia&mdash;a reputable organisation&mdash;speaking about what the HIA is lying to the Australian community about.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not seen what Senator Vanstone alleges are the quotes of the New South Wales Young Labor organisation, but if they are accurately quoted and quoted in context in her question I disagree with them. I disagree with them because of the premise upon which it seems this question is predicated and upon which those remarks appear, given reference to the question, to be based; that is, that the youth training wage we are trying to introduce into Australia has nothing to do in the immediate context with trying to alleviate youth unemployment. That will be an effect of it, but that is not its purpose. Its purpose is to skill the Australian community, particularly young workers, so that they not only can take jobs in the future but also can look forward to careers, given that they become parts of a highly skilled Australian work force able to absorb rapid technological change and be one of the key inputs in making this country world competitive by using a highly skilled base in the Australian community to add to the industry changes that we are making.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key purpose of a youth training wage arises from the Carmichael report into youth and training and, in particular, access to trade training.

For these reasons, if the Young Labor organisation did say what Senator Vanstone said it did, I disagree with it.</PARA>

How come it has taken him so long to come to this conclusion in respect of the need for a youth training wage?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The supplementary question related to the competence of the Minister's Government in relation to the youth training wage, and in particular to the competence of the Minister himself and the Minister whom he represents.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also doubled the high school retention rate. The point is that our approach to the labour market is to concentrate on educational opportunity, skill and training, without its being a precondition that people have to be rich to go to university as the Fightback package or the consumption tax package of the Opposition would require them to be. Our approach is to provide access and equity for Australians, not to make the level of wealth and private privilege a basis for access to higher education.</PARA>

Did the Department also realise that one month after the Tiananmen Square massacre the same Zhang Jianmin, in an address to the Beijing municipal government, said that amongst its tasks was to `carry the struggle of ferreting out counter-revolutionary rebels through to the end'? If the Department was aware of that, did it warn the Brisbane City Council about those facts and about the inappropriateness of the action that the Council took?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen some of the press reports of the comments made by the two Premiers. Indeed, I had discussions with Ministers in the Victorian and South Australian governments about some of these issues a week or two ago. Officials have also had discussions about the issues. In terms of Senator Spindler's question, I am aware of the issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current concern of the Premiers in those two States arises from the impact of high unemployment. High unemployment is largely a consequence of the recession, although it is said by some to be a consequence of changes in tariff structures. In relation to the employment issue and the impact of the recession, employment in the year to September 1991 in the textiles industry declined by 10 per cent, the clothing industry by 14 per cent and the footwear industry by 19 per cent. That should be compared with declines in employment in other industries, such as 12 per cent in paper and paper products; metal products, 14 per cent; miscellaneous transport equipment, 20 per cent; miscellaneous manufacturing, 15 per cent; and financial services industries, 25 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The financial services industries are not protected by any tariffs and never have been. The decline in employment in these industries, for a variety of reasons which I do not want or need to go into at this stage, has been much more significant than it has, for example, in the textiles, clothing and footwear industries. This certainly is true in some other areas of what are effectively more straight up and down manufacturing activities. The eye of the storm in relation to this debate has become the textiles, clothing and footwear industries, because they are the industries which have been used to the highest protection and have been used to relying on protection as a solution to their problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I have seen the Premiers' statement on the TCF sector and while I think there are many things that can be done for this sector, I do not agree that one of them is to change the structural adjustment measures which are already in place. The reason for that, simply, is that tariffs as a mechanism of supporting industry are inward looking mechanisms, not outward looking mechanisms. There are plenty of things that I am prepared to look at which might be regarded as outward looking mechanisms and, indeed, I will be making an announcement about this in relation to the textiles, clothing and footwear industries in the not too distant future.</PARA>

As far as Senator Spindler's proposed select committee is concerned, for reasons which I have hinted at in my answer to this question, I am not sure that it is a profitable exercise to tie up senators' time with inward looking measures. As I have said here before, it would be a cruel delusion to think that the competitiveness and employment problems of this economy are pre-eminently related to tariffs. It would be a cruel delusion to pretend that by taking what I would regard as a backward step in relation to tariffs in these industries, we would be arresting what is a difficult and unfortunate decline in employment. That decline is related to a whole range of factors apart from this&mdash;most importantly, the recession, but also lack of investment in the past, lack of management initiatives and a whole range of issues&mdash;which I think are more important issues to address than those implicit in this question.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tourism is already one of our fastest growth industries and has enormous future potential. This industry already employs around 450,000 Australians. All of the recent changes and progressive developments that the Government has made in the aviation area, for example, are planned to enhance this important industry. This Government does recognise the importance of this industry and recently released a national tourism strategy entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tourism: Australia's Passport to Growth</EMPHASIS>.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When launching this strategy, Mr Griffiths outlined six key priority areas for further development in the industry: vigorous promotion of Australia as a tourist destination; creation of a favourable investment climate for the industry, which of course was recently enhanced with the initiatives in the One Nation statement; development of a competitive transport sector, particularly in aviation; improving the statistical base of the industry; developing the skills base of the industry work force; and targeting the growth of key market segments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The strategy will improve the coordination of government policy as it affects the industry and will help the industry to achieve its growth potential. The targets in the strategy are based on annual growth rates of between 8 per cent and 11 per cent in international tourism numbers to Australia. To accommodate the growth in tourist numbers, the strategy points out that 90,000 additional hotel rooms will be needed in Australia by the turn of the century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is confident that the positive framework provided by the national tourism strategy will assist the industry to fulfil this potential.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Quite clearly, the importance of investor confidence in the integrity of the market is a crucial element in Australia's recovery from some of the excesses of the late 1980s. Indeed, I believe that the major impediment and frustration in the reform of companies and securities law undertaken by this Government was the Legislative Council of Western Australia. It was whipped into submission by Senator Campbell and Senator Crichton-Browne and I thank those honourable senators for assisting in that respect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I must say that it has been a first priority of the Government to put in place a regulatory framework for the Australian companies and securities regime which will, as I say, restore integrity to the marketplace and, therefore, enhance investor confidence, which is so important for the creation of wealth in the Australian community. One of the first measures introduced by this Government after the new national scheme came into place on 1 January 1991 was a complete overhaul of the insider trading regulations and provisions. Those provisions, which took effect from 1 August 1991, contain much greater clarity with respect to what will count as insider trading and, thereby, we hope this will facilitate prosecutions for the offence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Maximum penalties for breach of the provisions have also been increased tenfold, which I think indicates the serious way in which Parliament looks at this matter. In fact, fines of up to $200,000 can be levied on individuals and up to $1m on bodies corporate. Individuals also face a maximum of five years imprisonment for breach of the insider trading provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of whether insider trading has occurred in the instance raised by Senator Maguire is a matter entirely for the Australian Securities Commission, which is an independent statutory body charged with responsibility for the administration and enforcement of company law. As such, not only would it be inappropriate for the Attorney-General to intervene or to try to influence that particular investigation but, indeed, under the Act he is expressly prohibited from giving a direction to the Securities Commission with respect to a particular case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think Senator Maguire also raised the question of the linking of Carlton and United Breweries and Power Brewing for a 20-year strategic alliance. I understand that that matter is being examined by the Trade Practices Commission. Professor Fels indicated that it was a matter of some concern and that an investigation was required. However, he did not indicate in his press release any particular prejudice concerning an outcome of that investigation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, it would not be appropriate to offer legal advice in relation to any individual cases, but some general comments can be made about the matter. The fact is that, at common law, members of the Australian defence forces hold their appointments and perform their duties under the pleasure of the Crown. That means that members of the Defence Force can be discharged or have their appointments terminated by the Governor-General at any time for any reason or for no reason at all, and no right of action would result from such termination or discharge.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, though, the legislation does provide that the relevant chief of staff is given a power to discharge soldiers and sailors for a prescribed reason and airmen for such reason as the chief of staff thinks fit. A breach of the ADF's policy in relation to homosexuality would constitute a prescribed reason under the Australian military regulations and the naval defence regulations. In that situation, if a soldier, sailor or airman were discharged by a chief of staff, he or she could seek to have the discharge set aside by a court on narrow grounds available for judicial review; that is, as to whether the dismissal or termination of appointment was lawfully undertaken, but certainly not as to the merits of the policy. No court can overturn the policy itself and, provided the policy is lawfully implemented, an aggrieved individual cannot ask the court to substitute its idea of public policy for that of the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has functions under its Act based on International Labour Organisation Convention 111. It can inquire into acts or practices which may constitute discrimination in employment.

It can also, under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, inquire into acts or practices of the Commonwealth which are inconsistent with or contrary to any human right, including the rights recognised in the covenant. Of course, the covenant protects the individual's right to privacy and equality before the law.</PARA>

The Act does not make discrimination unlawful, nor does it provide for enforcement mechanisms where the Commission finds discrimination to be established.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Powell also asked about the international recourse that might be had. Under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Australia is under an obligation not to arbitrarily or unlawfully interfere with a person's privacy. That is under article 17 of the covenant. Under the first optional protocol, complaint can be made to the United Nations Human Rights Committee if an individual's rights under the covenant are violated, provided the individual has exhausted all domestic remedies. All the Committee can do is deliver a view; it cannot enforce any particular point of view.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security. Is the Minister aware of concern about Australian pensioners at present in the former Yugoslavia who have been prevented by United Nations sanctions from receiving their pensions which they desperately need? Is the Australian Government seeking ways of enabling these payments to be made, including persuading the United Nations that money needed for food and medicine is humanitarian aid?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4160" SPEAKER="Bolkus Sen The Hon N." NAMEID="XE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am advised by the Minister that he is aware of the effect of the UN sanctions and the fact that because of them the paying of Australian pensions to some 1,561 eligible pensioners in those republics has in fact been suspended. The genesis of the problem is that those payments were made in US dollar cheques drawn on a US bank and airmailed to their destinations. Of course, in the last month the US has blocked the honouring of US cheques paid into Serbian and Montenegron banks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to this part of the problem, mail deliveries in the republics have been severely curtailed and alternative methods of payment cannot be guaranteed. The Australian Government did in fact approach the UN sanctions committee on 12 June and was given a response to its request. The response was that our request was rejected. Basically, our request was for special consideration to be given for pensions to be paid on humanitarian grounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The DSS does have staff in Belgrade and, in the light of this, they have made efforts to advise pensioners of options. These options include having payments made to Australian bank accounts, which many of those people still maintain; making payments to nominated addresses outside Serbia and Montenegro; or, of course, keeping pensions suspended until sanctions are lifted. Those who cannot get their pensions now have been assured that they will be entitled to full back payment when those sanctions are in fact lifted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department continues to explore ways of continuing to pay pensions. There are severe practical problems affecting banking, transport and postal services and those problems remain. I am advised that the majority of the affected pensioners have been contacted by those locally employed staff in Belgrade and have chosen not to have their pensions paid into Australian bank accounts, although some have nominated addresses elsewhere in Europe. I can only say at this stage that the situation is being kept under review.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister for Defence to explain why Australian Colonel John Wilson, the Chief Military Observer for the United Nations Protective Force in Yugoslavia, was not paid his allowances for six months&mdash;until just the other day. Does the Minister acknowledge that this posting is a dangerous one, that the allowances are in recognition of this and that Colonel Wilson has twice been mortared and sniped at? Is it correct that last week he was joined by three more Australians? Can the Minister advise the Senate whether their allowances are being paid and, if not, when they might confidently expect to receive their proper entitlements for hazardous duty? What does the Minister regard as acceptable delays in paying soldiers their entitlements?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Colonel Wilson is a specialist case, of course. We were able to settle those issues in terms of the Gulf and Cambodia relatively quickly, whereas, as Senator Newman would realise, Colonel Wilson transferred directly from New York&mdash;well, partly New York and partly UNTSO in the Middle East&mdash;to this position. Therefore, negotiations as to what exactly the entitlements were probably were not given the highest priority, and that is quite justifiable, given the need to get Cambodia and others out of the road. The entitlements are now settled and they are also settled for the other three Australians, as I understand it. Therefore, payments can and should be made on time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do acknowledge the quite serious circumstances under which people in Yugoslavia have to operate. I would not try to mislead anyone as to the high threat assessment that exists in trying to serve there basically for humanitarian reasons, et cetera, as the honourable senator would know. I do not think it got the same priority as the Gulf and Cambodia simply because fewer people were involved. I understand the situation has now been rectified and will be rectified for the three people who have transferred from UNTSO to Yugoslavia in the last week.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As this question suggests, Mr Pat Brazil did accept the chairmanship role on this review but withdrew after we had announced he was the chairman because he found later, in conference with his legal firm, that there were potential conflicts of interest. I should say that that was the whole and sole reason not, as some newspapers have reported today, because of a potential conflict of interest and a disagreement with the terms of reference for the inquiry. The latter part was never mentioned by Mr Brazil in any way, shape or form. In fact, as I understand the circumstances, he agreed with the terms of reference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday I announced that Mr Ian Macphee, a former Liberal Party Minister in the House of Representatives and now a partner in a prominent Australian law firm, will chair the independent review of the Australian air traffic transport system. I believe that Mr Macphee will bring to this inquiry the degree of integrity and expertise that is required, and will ensure that all issues are thoroughly addressed in a completely independent and satisfactory way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a first step, Mr Macphee will satisfy himself that the terms of reference which have been drawn up are comprehensive enough to enable the review to address all of the concerns that have been raised about this particular project. Mr Macphee will also choose the specialist advisers with the necessary technical and financial skills, and draw on whatever advice he considers appropriate as an aid to his making that selection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that the chairman be satisfied that the review has been given the necessary time to carry out its duties and finalise its report. I will be discussing these issues with Mr Macphee and with the Acting Chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority, Mr Henry Bosch, later this week. However, it will be a matter for the review alone to determine the procedures under which it will operate and to ensure that arrangements are in place which will respect the necessary confidentiality of individuals and organisations making submissions during the review's proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review will be impartial and fair; it will report to me and the Civil Aviation Authority concurrently; and the report will be released publicly. I reiterate my concern to ensure that a fair and proper procedure is followed in the naming of the preferred contractor. I believe that the review is the right mechanism for achieving this.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. The Minister would be aware of the devastating drought that has affected western New South Wales for most of the past three years. He would know of the three million sheep that have been lost and the serious impact that this has had on the national wool clip and the viability of the people in that area. Given that the Minister for Primary Industries has at last acknowledged the seriousness of the situation and made a belated and short&mdash;four-hour&mdash;trip to Bourke and Louth last week, can the Minister advise when those people might expect some sort of response from the Federal Government as to what assistance it is prepared to give?

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1992 No.58, considered by the Committee at its meeting of 30 April 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Explanatory Statement advises that recent advice had been received that an existing regulation to similar effect was invalidly made. No details of the reasons for the invalidity are given. We assume that it was because the repealed regulation was made in 1985 and lacked the authority which was expressly inserted (s.76(4)(aa)) in the parent Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981 in 1987. However, we would be grateful for your advice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On a more important matter, the present Regulations provide for the standard of proof required in proceedings before the Federal Police Disciplinary Tribunal to be beyond reasonable doubt, which is the same standard required for criminal cases. The Committee would appreciate your detailed advice on the reasons for this standard, rather than the civil standard of the balance of probabilities. Given the nature of the relevant proceedings, the personal rights and liberties of the public may be better protected by the civil standard of proof.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On another matter, r.3.1 provides that the amendment "extends to proceedings commenced, or concerning a matter that arose, before the date of commencement of these Regulations". If the previous regulation was invalid, the fact that the new regulation extends to these proceedings and matters raises the possibility that the present regulation could operate prejudicially. This may not be the case if, in the absence of the present regulations, the less strict balance of probabilities was to apply. The Committee would appreciate your assurance that the regulations do not have prejudicial retrospectivity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yours sincerely</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Patricia Giles</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Chair</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">26 May 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Giles</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 30 April 1992 concerning the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1992 No.58.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You ask my advice on three matters in relation to this Amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, you ask what were the reasons for the invalidity of the previous r.9 which is replaced by the Amendment. Your Committee is right in its assumption that the reason is that the repealed r.9 was made in 1985 and that it now appears that no authority for such a regulation was provided by the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981 until the enactment of s.76(4)(aa) in 1987.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, you ask why the regulation adopts the criminal rather than the civil standard of proof in proceedings before the Federal Police Disciplinary Tribunal. In practice, this standard has been in use since 1985, when the repealed r.9 was made following prolonged consultation between relevant Departments and the Australian Federal Police Association (the AFPA). When the invalidity of that regulation came to light late last year I did not consider it appropriate to make use of this technicality to overturn the existing arrangement. The purpose of the Amendment is to rectify the invalidity of r.9 rather than to implement a new policy decision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That said, I believe the considerations which led to the original decision on this matter are still valid. The penalties which can be imposed as a result of disciplinary proceedings, while differing in their legal character from criminal penalties, can have practical consequences as severe as any criminal sentence short of imprisonment. Moreover, many acts constituting a breach of discipline in the Australian Federal Police would also be crimes. (While this is not unique to policing, it is more significant than it would be for most other groups subject to disciplinary regimes, particularly because of the confrontational character of much police interaction with the public. One other area where disciplinary offences are often also criminal offences is the Defence Force, whose discipline code also prescribes the criminal standard of proof.) In my view it is not desirable to encourage the handling of such matters otherwise than by criminal prosecution. That view is already reflected in the requirement of the Australian Federal Police (Discipline) Regulations that where a prosecution is initiated any disciplinary proceeding in relation to the same matter should be suspended for the duration of the prosecution and in the practice of investigating a complaint as a crime rather than a breach of discipline in the first instance if there is any reason to suspect criminality. The prospect of being able to satisfy a lesser standard of proof before the Disciplinary Tribunal would inevitably tend to discourage rigorous pursuit of criminal investigations in such circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In any case, the AFP's Internal Investigation Division has the power to require a member under investigation for a breach of discipline to answer its questions even where an answer may tend to incriminate the member, an advantage not enjoyed by most disciplinary investigators and which does not have the potential to harm an honest member in the way that a lower standard of proof could do in ambiguous circumstances. In this regard it must be remembered that the complaints procedure provides not only an avenue of redress for the genuinely aggrieved but also a means for rightly accused persons to raise doubts about police evidence or avenge themselves on a member. Accusations against the police should therefore not be too lightly accepted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Lastly, you ask for my assurance that the regulations do not have prejudicial retrospectivity by reason of the provisions of r.3.1. This provision was included in order to eliminate any doubt about the standard of proof applicable in subsequent hearings of cases which had in some sense begun before the commencement of the new r.9, so its operation is not strictly retrospective. In any case, no question of prejudice arises. The only people who could be prejudiced in a legal sense by a change in the standard of proof are AFP members facing charges. Technically, the effect of the Amendment is to provide a higher standard of proof in future, which would be to the advantage of such members if it affected them at all. In practice the standard of proof applied has not changed. (Even after it was realised that the regulation was technically invalid, it would have been quite inappropriate for the Commonwealth to have pleaded the invalidity of its own legislation.) Accordingly, I can assure you that no one will have suffered retrospective prejudice as a result of this provision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I thank your Committee for its interest in these matters and hope that the above comments satisfactorily address its concerns.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 26 May 1992 on aspects raised by the Committee of the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1992 No. 58.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee dealt with this matter over several meetings, which indicates the importance of the issues involved. The Committee was also briefed by the Commonwealth Ombudsman and other officials from the Ombudsman's office. In addition, we gave a notice of motion of disallowance of the regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee eventually decided to accept the advice in your letter. In this case, the basic issue appeared to be that, on the one hand, while the criminal standard of proof in disciplinary proceedings gave a high standard of protection to the individual police officers involved, this standard gave a lesser protection to broader interests. On the other hand, the civil standard of proof would reduce the safeguards for individual officers although ensuring considerable protection for the broader public interest. In this situation, where reasonable people may differ on sensitive issues of personal and other rights, the Committee decided to accept the regulations as they exist and agreed to remove its notice of disallowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nevertheless, the Committee draws to your attention the attached document presented to us by the Ombudsman, "The standard of proof in police disciplinary matters". The Committee considers that its quality is such that it should be taken into account during any future review of this aspect of the regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Incidentally, the Ombudsman has informed us that Western Australia has now adopted the civil standard of proof in police disciplinary proceedings, so that five States now have the floating civil standard.</PARA>

<PARA>I congratulate the Auditor-General on this excellent report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Project Audit&mdash;Department of Administrative Services&mdash;Debt Management</EMPHASIS>. In the main, the responses from both the Department of Administrative Services and the Department of Finance have been very positive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I consider the recommendations of the Auditor-General, as pointed out in the summary, to be applicable for all public sector agencies adopting private sector practices. I make that point because the Auditor-General has used DAS, which has a lot of corporatised operations, as an example and said, `Let's apply this across the board', where the Government has corporatised or commercialised various operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me touch on a few aspects of the report. The Auditor-General recommends that all business units develop and implement comprehensive debt management procedures. One worrying aspect of the Government's commercialisation, or corporatisation, is that debt collection is a key factor in any commercial operation, whether it be in the private or the public sector. This fact seems to have slipped by the Government and the various commercial departments in DAS. Failure to collect bad debts can result in liquidity problems, which can put a normal operation out of business. But the public sector, of course, has the Linus blanket&mdash;it can always go back to the Budget if it finds itself in difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another recommendation in the Auditor-General's report is that business units develop and use memorandums of understanding or a similar arrangement in clarifying and formalising terms and conditions of trade. The Department has responded by saying that it will go in that direction by encouraging a clear delineation of provider procurer responsibilities through the greater use of memorandums of understanding, exchanging of correspondence and pre-engagement negotiations to avoid misunderstandings, including any relating to building and payment arrangements. These measures are critical in any commercial operation for the continued viability of a normal operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not go through all the recommendations of the Auditor-General. However, he recommends that greater emphasis be placed on debt performance indicators to assist in monitoring debt management performance. Again, this relates back to the importance that one sector of the community, the private sector, puts on debt management and the collection of debts and the real lack of interest that is shown by the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Audit Office also recommends improvements by introducing techniques such as invoices with detachable remittance advice to facilitate the accurate and timely matching of payments with client accounts and associated debtor records. DAS, I believe quite correctly, points out that the proposed upgrade of the Department of Finance account payment system will address the referencing deficiency. So the Department is saying that it has flicked it back to the Department of Finance, and it deserves a little flick over the knuckles with the feather duster too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Audit Office recommends that public sector agencies improve their payment procedures to ensure the payment of correctly rendered invoices by the due date. Two points are made by the Auditor-General: one is that there is some doubt about the correct rendering of invoices; and the other one is that it seems that other public sector agencies tend to put their own brother organisations, if I can call them that, at the bottom of the pile. I see that the Minister responsible, the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus), is sitting at the table. It might be useful if one day he sends the debt collectors to one of his other government agencies. It would be interesting to see the result. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister says that it will not be long before that happens. The Audit Office also recommended&mdash;I was pleased to see that the Department actually took a guarded approach to this&mdash;that changes be made to the existing administrative and legislative frameworks through amendments to the finance regulations and directions to provide for debt management options, including the use of memoranda of understanding, the use of incentives and penalties, and debt factoring. I believe that the Department has quite correctly said that it is not really impressed with debt factoring&mdash;and neither, might I say, would I be. It has always been a sign of bankruptcy when a company starts to factor its own debts. From what I have seen in my career, companies pass the point of no return once they start factoring debt. I think it would be an interesting reflection on the government of the day, whatever colour it may be, if suddenly it was made known in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> that that government was out factoring its debts, particularly to itself. I can see the problems associated with that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final recommendation is that DAS continue to examine service delivery arrangements which involve the payment for goods and services at the time of delivery. That has a lot of things going for it. It puts other departments, particularly recalcitrant departments, on notice that, if they want the goods that are provided quite efficiently by certain areas of DAS, they should pay up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one reads the DAS response, which I will not do in the interests of time because we have a lot of legislation to get through, one can see that it does have all the hallmarks of a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yes, Minister</EMPHASIS> reply. So I draw the Minister's attention to the Department's response to recommendation No. 12 because it contains all the gobbledegook associated with a typical <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yes, Minister</EMPHASIS> reply. And as everyone knows, Jim Hacker was the Minister for Administrative Services in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yes, Minister</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having dealt with the recommendations and responses, I would now like to refer to the key findings. The Audit Office found that the debt management programs of the business units of DAS have continued to be affected by a legacy of outstanding debts, inadequate debt collection procedures and systems, and inexperienced staff. The time for excuses of inexperienced staff has well passed. This has been going on for something like three years now. If one looks at the chart provided by the Auditor-General, one notices that the total outstanding debts have changed from just over $200m in September 1990 to $160m-odd in December 1991. So the improvement is pretty poor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commented earlier that the longstanding practice of public sector agencies giving low priority to payment of intra-Commonwealth debts has to be addressed. It seems to me that a debt is a debt by a government organisation, whether that debt is owed to DAS or whether it is owed to a private sector organisation. All debts should be given equal priority. I am not talking about DAS being a monopoly supplier. I am referring to other government departments being in a very strong buying position, almost a monopoly buying position, which can be used to their advantage. This is really to the disadvantage of the commercial operations because not only can it put them at risk but also it can put them out of business. The Audit Office also found that Commonwealth departments and agencies need to review account payment mechanisms to ensure that correctly rendered invoices are paid by the `due date'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, it seems that the Auditor-General is saying that more attention must be given, not only by DAS but by other commercial operations of government, to the collection of debts and that government departments themselves must give due diligence to the payment of debts owed, whether it be to DAS or any other government organisation or, for that matter, to anyone in the private sector. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amending Bills strengthen the law, give appropriate greater powers to the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs with regard to refugees and set up the Migration Agents Registration Board to attempt to overcome&mdash;and I am confident the Migration Amendment Bill (No. 3) will go some way towards doing so&mdash;abuses which have developed around the practice of charging fees for immigration advice that some Australians have taken up. There are appropriate exemptions and a reasonable structure has now emerged after careful consultation between the Minister and the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will begin with the Migration Amendment Bill (No. 2). Because there is a guillotine in operation&mdash;that is, there is a deadline for debate on these Bills&mdash;introduced by the Government and the Australian Democrats, we must restrain ourselves, keep to the point and leave out a number of matters that we would have liked to have raised, especially in terms of this Government's failures in immigration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal change in the Migration Amendment Bill (No. 2) relates to refugees.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We have in this country a compassionate history of welcoming to Australia bona fide refugees from what is now almost every part of the world. The two categories that are most in our minds are those refugees who fled from eastern Europe at the end of the Second World War and who have, in many thousands of cases, made excellent citizens of this country. The second is the wave of refugee immigrants to this country from Indo-China again following the events of oppressive communist governments. Again, thousands of these refugees have made excellent citizens of this country. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill strengthens the hand of the Minister in a way which is entirely acceptable to the Opposition. It gives the Minister authority to deal with applications for refugee status in such order as the Minister considers appropriate. In addition, the Minister's obligation to decide refugee claims where the applicant holds a permanent entry permit, entry visa or even a PRC temporary entry permit is removed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another feature of this Migration Amendment Bill (No. 2) is that a conditional entry procedure for business migration is being made available for the first time. Unfortunately, we have found that a number of business migrants to Australia have not lived up to their stated intentions of investing the capital that they brought with them to generate employment and additional prosperity for themselves and for other Australians. A particular advantage is given to a small number of immigrants who bring more than half a million dollars and who otherwise meet the requirements to live in Australia. They are required to put that half a million dollars or more into an investment in Australia to the better interests of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where this has not actually happened in practice, the Opposition believes that there is a need to tighten the requirement, monitor what happens and revoke the entry permit if the undertakings which were given are not lived up to. For the first time we will have a conditional entry: you can enter, we will monitor and if you live up to your undertakings given in the application, your permit to remain in Australia will be confirmed; if not, it will not be confirmed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to illegal fishermen, we welcome moves to make it less financially attractive for overseas persons to come into Australian waters. Where Australian law is broken, where there is trespass by an overseas fishing vessel into Australian waters, the costs involved in their apprehension, detention, transport back to their home country and any legal expenses may now be billed to those fishermen or to those companies and persons who are associated with the fishermen being in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other matters relating to review authorities being able to remit their decisions to the decision maker without having to wait for the Department. There are minor amendments relating to when the Minister sets aside a decision within his Department, and the requirement in those cases for the Minister to report to the Parliament. There are also a number of technical amendments, all of which have been carefully discussed by the Minister and the Opposition. We thank him for that consultation. We support all elements of the Bill. However, on behalf of the Opposition, I move:</PARA>

<PARA>On 25 February I asked a question in the Senate about some 56 illegal immigrants who landed in Western Australia on the last day of last year and were discovered early in January, in the heat of the summer. What has happened to them? They are still here. There is still a failure by this Government to deal not only with these illegal immigrants, according to law and due process in an expeditious manner, but also with the other boatloads who have been here 2 1/2 years now. They arrived here illegally, jumping the queue on the other one million persons around the world who want to migrate to Australia by lawful application, without discrimination and on the basis of our declared law. These queue jumpers have arrived here, no doubt desperate because they were in poverty and wanted to better their lives by coming to a happy and lucky country&mdash;Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Relative to Cambodia at the moment, I think Senator Button would concede that even under the present Government, which has led to this country having one million unemployed and a Prime Minister (Mr Keating) who was not elected by the people and who lacks their confidence, for these poor people who braved the sea to come here, perhaps with the glimmer in their eye that there will be a Liberal and National government by May 1993, Australia is a better and safer place for them to get on with their lives. No-one contests that. We do not even contest that many illegal immigrants in this country will make hardworking, prosperous, good Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the point is that we have by this Parliament a defined immigration program that gives fairness and equality, with no discrimination and no queue jumping. It is administered according to law, fairly and with compassion. I hope Senator Coulter will concede that those of us who do require immigration according to law are not lacking in compassion. We have heart. We want an immigration program. Often the Democrats do not want any immigration at all. If anyone is lacking in compassion in the debate on immigration in this country, it would have to be the Democrats, who do not want cousins, brothers and sisters reunited with members of their family who have already migrated to this country from wherever in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those people who look through the barbed wire fence of the Port Hedland detention centre&mdash;I do not think it actually is barbed wire, but it is at least a cyclone fence&mdash;will see the faces of those illegal immigrants imploring Australians that they be able to remain here, even if they are illegal immigrants. We ought not to be moved only by our emotions; we ought to give a proper confirmation of what is law in this country, what is fair in this country and what is well managed in this country. If the Democrats were to criticise even Senator Button or even the Government for a lack of compassion in upholding the law of Australia in immigration matters, I think they would need to look at their own conduct with regard to their wanting to have virtually no immigration, or at least minimal immigration, into this country. What is compassionate?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move on quickly to the matter of the abuses that have occurred as a result of persons charging fees&mdash;often exorbitant fees&mdash;on the grounds that they are giving migration advice to some person applying for a migration decision either within Australia or outside Australia. The Opposition supports the concept in this Bill that a migration agents registration board ought to be set up. It ought to have the powers to act quickly, to warn, to suspend, to deregister, to reject applications for registration, to test whether applicants who register as migration agents have the integrity and qualifications to offer to the public what they profess, and, generally, to administer this area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There have been members of the Labor Party who have offended greatly in this way, whilst none come to mind from this side. I notice that this Bill allows members of parliament to register. As a personal aside, I would not allow members of parliament to register as migration agents. That is my personal view. I believe that members of parliament are already elected to represent the people and ought to give their advice entirely free. Woe be it if any senator puts up a billboard on his private office to say that he is a migration agent and charges fees for what he ought to be giving freely to any person who inquires of him. It would be a very brave member of parliament on either side who would go against that kind of moral suasion. I hope that it is effective suasion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the consequences of offending. If someone says that he is a migration agent, without being registered, there is a fine of $5,000. If he charges somebody a fee, he would be liable to 10 years imprisonment or a $60,000 fine, or both. These are very heavy penalties. They are obviously to deter anyone from thinking about doing any of these things improperly once this law is passed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot go over the code of conduct that is to be determined. I know that it is in its draft stage at the moment; we have not seen it in its final form. If it is not acceptable after proper consultation with the Opposition, we would seek to disallow it when it comes before the Parliament. We do expect to be consulted and we hope that a satisfactory code can be determined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also briefly note that the Law Institute of Victoria in particular, the Law Council of Australia and various other lawyers bodies have very much resisted this Bill because they want lawyers to be able to give advice and receive fees for their advice without the constraints of and the regulation flowing from this Bill. It is a happy consequence that in the committee stage the Government will be introducing a late amendment with regard to lawyers and other persons who handle five or less cases per year. Instead of having a registration fee of $1,000 a year, they will have a fee of only $100 a year&mdash;that is 10 per cent&mdash;and they will trip the higher fee when they go to the sixth case. I think that is fair. It is the proposition that my party room was working towards. As a result of consultation between Mr Ruddock, the Opposition spokesman for immigration and ethnic affairs, and the Minister, Mr Hand, this amendment has come forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All consular and diplomatic persons in Australia will also be exempt from this Bill. They will be able to give advice to their own citizens. That is not intended to be made a transgression by this Bill. Regrettably, it is necessary to have these regulations. Liberals go very slowly into new areas of regulation. Because of the offences in this area, the law does need to be tidied up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by repeating that these measures, especially in the Migration Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992, are only part of the measures the Opposition has been calling for. We want an migration program that is well managed and wins the confidence of the public of Australia. That is not the case at the moment. I believe that the Government's failures in immigration will be another noose around its neck when the next election comes along. Because of the failures of the Labor Party in immigration, quite apart from the horrendous failures in the economy, it deserves to lose office. The sort of management that can win the confidence of the Australian people will be gained only when there is a Liberal-National Party government. </PARA>

I wish to speak to the Migration Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1992 and in the process will pick up the related Bills. The Bills give effect to a registration scheme for migration agents and establish the Migration Agents Registration Board and a code of conduct for such agents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats support this legislation in the interests of improving the standards of professional conduct and quality of service. We recognise that there have been complaints against incompetent or unscrupulous agents and the situation needs to be addressed. I note that Australia is the first country with a major migration program to introduce regulatory arrangements of this kind. Given the extent to which legal and illegal immigration appears to be almost out of control in some countries, notably in the USA, I hope that this legislation can be a model for other immigration host countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats welcome the introduction of a code of conduct, although, as Senator Baden Teague has said, we have not yet seen the code of conduct. We look forward to the opportunity to look at the draft code of conduct. Hopefully, this will provide appropriate guidelines for actual or intending migration agents and provide the basis for an improvement in professional standards. Just as important, it will provide a guide for consumers as well as for agents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we understand the opposition of the legal profession to the concept of an independent body&mdash;namely, the Migration Agents Registration Board&mdash;disciplining its members in cases of incompetence or misconduct, we recognise that there is a high level of fragmentation amongst migration agents with professions organised into their own distinct associations and a large number of people acting alone. It is hoped, however, that the Government will maintain a close dialogue with the legal profession as the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) stated that he hoped to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We welcome the most recent amendments which have the effect, as Senator Baden Teague has already indicated, of lowering the registration fee for migration agents from $1,000 to $100 where they deal with fewer than five cases per year. This takes into account the few hundred agents who, for various reasons, such as being based in rural towns, handle only a few cases each year. The amendments which exclude members of diplomatic missions, consular posts or certain international organisations, such as the United Nations High Commission on Refugees, are also welcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to pick up on some of the things that Senator Baden Teague said about the Democrats. It is simply untrue that the Democrats are opposed on humanitarian grounds to immigration. We recognise several aspects. We recognise that we have a duty not only to the people who are living today but also to future generations of Australians. This inter-generational equity was well developed in the ESD process committees. It is a matter of fact that if we double the population in an area, all other things being equal, the environmental impact will be doubled. Consequently, we need to look at the ultimate carrying capacity of this country in terms of the ecological ability of Australia to carry that number of people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a matter of demographic fact that with a net migration program of 50,000 per year, which is roughly where it is now, the population of Australia would gradually grow in an asymptote pattern to about 25 million and do it in a way which would not produce hiccups and difficulties in its age structure. So we have a commitment to stabilise the population over the long term, which will take about 60 years to achieve, and relate it to the actual carrying capacity of the country. We have made it abundantly clear that within that 50,000 we would put a very heavy emphasis on those most in need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is where I would take issue with Senator Teague and perhaps contrast briefly the difference between business migrants and refugees. Business migrants, by definition, are those who have made half a million dollars in their own country. If they have half a million dollars, it is very likely that in terms of wealth they exceed the amount of personal wealth of perhaps 95 per cent of Australians. They have made that money in a foreign country and they seek to move it to Australia for their own personal benefit. It seems to me naive for Australians to consider that people who have made an amount of money that large in a foreign country and who have simply moved it to Australia for further economic or financial benefit will necessarily have any loyalty to Australia and that when conditions here are not as good as in some third country they will simply not up sticks and take their money elsewhere. We have always had some difficulty with, as I say, the naivety of government that believes business migration will necessarily benefit the country, and benefit the country in the long term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, when one looks at refugees, by definition, these are people who for a variety of reasons simply cannot continue in their own country. Not only would it seem to us that those people are far more likely to make better long term citizens but also we would be exercising our responsibility as international citizens if we were to substantially increase the refugee component of our migration program. But, having said that, one has to recognise that the number of refugees in the world is so large and growing so rapidly that it is simply physically impossible for Australia to make a significant dent in the refugee problem by bringing any reasonable number of people into this country. For argument's sake, if we were to roughly double the refugee program and bring in 20,000 people each year, that would make but a very small dent in the 17 million refugees around the world, which number, as I say, is growing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have made quite clear on a number of occasions that we believe it is appropriate for Australia to increase very substantially its foreign aid program and target that increased foreign aid specifically towards the causes of people becoming refugees. Any honourable senators who saw the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Couchman</EMPHASIS> program last week on ABC television could not help but have been impressed by the fact that all those people in the program, irrespective of their country of origin, made the very strong point that in coming to Australia as refugees they had lost their identity; they had moved into a foreign culture; they had lost their birth certificate or marriage certificate. Just about everything which made them a person was lost upon being moved to a foreign country, and they had great difficulty in establishing a new identity in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Far from being uncaring, as Senator Teague tried to indicate, the Democrats, as I say, would substantially address this problem, firstly, by increasing the number of refugees coming to Australia and, secondly, by substantially increasing Australian foreign aid to other countries and directing it to those factors which cause people to become refugees so that, hopefully, more people will not become refugees and will be able to remain satisfactorily in their own home countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats applaud this legislation, which leads to a tightening up of our immigration procedures. In 1987-88, the proposed 140,000 annual intake blew out to an actual 171,000. We are facing a world where there is increasing pressure on our shores and more and more people deeming Australia a relatively desirable place to live. Some seek genuine political asylum, others just a better life. However, those who request to stay here have a right to proper advice and to be protected from the unscrupulous.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to briefly support the Migration Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992, the Migration Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1992, the Migration Agents Registration (Application) Levy Bill 1992 and the Migration Agents Registration (Renewal) Levy Bill 1992 and the amendment moved by my colleague Senator Teague. Unfortunately, this is another situation where a set of very important Bills has to be rushed through this Parliament because the Australian Democrats have done a deal with the Government yet again. They have caved in and allowed these sorts of things to be done without proper scrutiny. It is of some regret that the comments I wish to make on the Bills generally are curtailed because of the Democrats and the Government getting together again to curtail free speech and to prevent proper scrutiny of the Bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Teague has very skilfully and capably mentioned the reason for the amendment and I will not, because of the shortness of time, say anything more about that. There were other matters in relation to the other Bills which I would have liked to have spoken on, but again I can only rely on the broad outline that my colleague was able to give, ever so capably, on the general thrust of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to confine my remarks generally to the Migration Agents Registration (Application) Levy Bill 1992 and the associated Migration Agents Registration (Renewal) Levy Bill 1992. At this stage I should indicate that I am a lawyer; I have not practised for the last two years since I have been in parliament but, if that requires me to disclose an interest, I hereby do so. It is of some general concern to me and to the legal profession that lawyers will be required to register with a government agency before they can provide services normally provided by lawyers to clients. In fact, it seems quite silly to me that lawyers who are trained very well and who have a feeling for legislation and the law are now going to be required to register with some government body before they can give the advice and do the interpretations that they are, by their profession, required to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legal profession is one of the very few professions or occupations that do have some self-regulatory mechanism. The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) and even, I regret to say, some of my colleagues have mentioned problems with lawyers in relation to migration matters. If there are problems&mdash;and I suspect they are very few&mdash;as to charging or as to competence, then the legal profession throughout Australia has always had its own very strict regulatory bodies which will investigate any allegations of wrongdoing, overcharging or incompetence. That is what stands lawyers out from the general run of the mill occupations; they are very strictly and honestly policed to ensure that the very highest standards are maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, lawyers are not all immigration experts but they are trained to interpret the law. They are trained to make the right inquiries. They are trained to give general advice and to point people in the right direction if they cannot finally help them. They are very well trained to realise when a problem comes up that is not within their ability to handle, and they will then refer it either to counsel or to a migration expert, if they are aware of one, who can deal with the matter properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lawyers whose work is limited to the provision of legal advice or lawyers acting in a professional capacity in the preparation of proceedings before a court or an administrative tribunal are not to be covered by this scheme. But apparently if they help to fill in some forms they will be covered by this scheme. How the demarcation between those two things will work is something that I will be interested to see in practice, because it will be very difficult to police. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As seems to be popular, the Minister, in his second reading speech, had a crack at lawyers and suggested that there may be some in the profession who need looking at. If that is the case and if there have been abuses by lawyers in the past, they should have been referred to their professional body for attention. This new body that we are setting up will simply duplicate, as far as lawyers are concerned, what has been happening with lawyers since they first became a profession many centuries ago. Lawyers have a self-regulatory mechanism. It seems unnecessary that they now need to be a part of this group yet again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope this move is not a trend that is proceeding generally with this Government's legislation. It is one that should be resisted. It means simply more red tape, more fees, more bureaucracy and more boards and bureaus that the independent profession will have to answer to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apparently under this new scheme there will be some qualifications for persons to be able to give this advice and to qualify for registration. As I understand it&mdash;and the Minister might correct me if I am wrong&mdash;the regulations prescribing the qualifications have not yet been announced. I understand that the barrier is to be a fairly low one and that the qualifications do not have to be particularly high. That seems to be of some concern more generally. Of course, all lawyers who are involved will have to be properly qualified in the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to speak very briefly now about the costs of registration. I point out to the Minister, in case he is not aware or interested, that not many people on the Government side and certainly no-one in the Australian Democrats have any real concept of what it is like living in a small rural community or an area that is not fully serviced. If someone lives in a community where there is a migration agent on every corner, maybe the requirement to register migration agents is a good idea. But in many rural communities, and in suburban areas of the capital and provincial cities, lawyers do assist migrants in filling in forms and giving very general legal advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can only talk from experiences I have had in rural Queensland. I know that many of my former colleagues in the law are in a similar situation where there are groups of migrants. There used to be a lot of Italians and Spaniards, and more recently Chinese and Vietnamese, where I come from. I might add as an aside that it is good to see them coming into those more remote areas. I wish there was some way of encouraging many of the immigrants who get into ghettos in the capital cities to get out into the better parts of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many migrants in rural areas. They do at times require a bit of advice&mdash;nothing terribly technical or substantial&mdash;and so they call upon their local solicitor, accountant or, at times, religious officer to get a little advice because in many cases they cannot speak English, they certainly cannot read English, and they do not understand the government system in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many migrants have come from systems where, to get any government service, one has to fork out a few dollars in bribes to get anywhere. They do not understand the system, so they come along to people they trust. In a small community, the people they trust are their solicitors and accountants. They get advice from them and some help with filling in forms. It is not the sort of work that solicitors and accountants in country areas want to attract&mdash;there is no real profit margin in it&mdash;but solicitors and accountants, as with many things they do, do it simply as a public service and charge a very minimal fee for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation as originally proposed had the ridiculous situation that a firm could register at a cost of $1,000 and any employees could register at a cost of $500. I know from my own experience that I fill in only one or two forms every year, and it would have cost $1,500. The end result would be that one simply would not register. In a small country town when those people came knocking at our door, we would try to help them anyway. But the proper thing to do would be to send them away and say, `We are not going to help you'. The alternative would be for them to get in their car, drive for three hours to a provincial city, find their way around, with no-one to help them because they do not know the people, and see whether they can get the advice. They would return probably more confused than when they left, because they would be dealing with people they do not know, do not understand and do not particularly trust. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased that, following representations made by the Law Council and also by the shadow Minister, Mr Ruddock, the Minister said in the other place that he would consider the matter and see whether some formula could be adopted which would overcome the sorts of problems I have identified and which are real. I am pleased that the Government has at least identified and accepted the problem and is doing something about it. Of course, the Government has simply reduced the fee to $50 and $100 instead of $500 and $1,000 if an agent assists in fewer than five cases. That is another $150 that has to be paid, which is not much. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Minister realises, if a solicitor handles five applications a year and pays $150 to be registered, the solicitor would simply add that on to the five bills, so the cost of justice would go up by yet another $30. From my experience, the bill for helping people to fill in the form, giving them advice or making a couple of phone calls would very seldom reach more than $30 in itself. Yet the bill will be doubled so that the solicitor can recoup the registration fee if he or she decides to go into it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most country lawyers and accountants will probably register just to provide this service. Many rural solicitors go for perhaps a year and do not see anyone, but then they may handle five or six applications in one year. Who knows? These things tend to follow. If a solicitor registers at a cost of $150, he or she will have to add an extra $30 to each bill. We will then find all the Labor Party people jumping up in a few months time berating the legal profession, saying how lawyers charge too much and how some people earn $10,000 a day. Of course, they are talking about the top QCs. They do not talk about the great majority of the legal profession who work for very modest fees, who themselves have very modest incomes and who provide an honest and trustworthy service right throughout their lives. I can guarantee that we will hear members of the Labor Party talking about the cost of justice and how it is all the lawyers' fault. They will conveniently forget that this is just one little example of where another $30 will be added on to the bill because this Government wants to set up a bureaucracy, register some people and somehow have more control and more fingers in the pie. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of engagements I will be unable to wait to hear the Minister's answer, but I will be able to read it in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> if he is able to answer my point. I would rather there be no registration at all but, if a solicitor has to be registered and deals with less than five applications, he or she should be put in a different category. I am not quite sure why the Government is bothering with this $150 fee. It is not a big amount, but it will not be the lawyers who pay it. The cost will simply go on to the immigrants and the people who need help. It is just another add-on. It is not a big thing, but why there needs to be any fee for those sorts of people at all I really do not know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time constrains me from any further pursuance of these matters. I commend the Bills to the Senate with the amendment that my colleague has moved and I ask that the Government give more consideration and a little extra thought to the necessity for lawyers to be registered in this instance. If the Government comes to the conclusion that it is unavoidable, I ask it to consider whether there needs to be any fee at all in those instances where lawyers and accountants are used on only a very small number of occasions. I might also say that, although there is obviously some reason for the $1,000 and $500 fee in the more major cases, the reason again escapes me. Is it just another attempt to balance the Government's $6 billion hole in the Budget? Is the Government trying to make it up in any way it can? Again, it seems to be quite unnecessary to have those sorts of fees simply added to the cost of doing business in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating Migration Amendment Bill (No. 2), Migration Amendment Bill (No. 3), the Migration Agents Registration (Application) Levy Bill 1992 and the Migration Agents Registration (Renewal) Levy Bill 1992. The migration amendment Bills come before the chamber now following a debate on 5 May of this year on amendments to the Migration Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that occasion the amendments presented to this chamber followed the rush of the Bill through the House of Representatives. The purpose of that rush became evident on 5 May when it became clear to a number of us that the Government's intention was to prevent an appeal by certain asylum seekers held in detention and the appeal on their behalf to the Federal Court. I refer the Senate to the debate that took place on 5 May and to the comments that I made during that debate. I indicated a view that I strongly held, and still strongly hold, that the action being taken by the Government in detaining asylum seekers in the manner in which it does is contrary to Australia's obligations under international treaty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know what is being said at times by the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs to its officers on the ground at Port Hedland and elsewhere. Some of those officers have become concerned at the obvious fact that the asylum seekers have come here because they have been forced out of their own country because of persecution and are fearful of return because they have well founded fears that they will suffer persecution on the grounds of race, colour, religion, political opinion, et cetera. Some of those people are in a dreadful state as a result of the fact that they are virtually incarcerated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, their feelings spill over to those in the compliance section of the Department. A number of people in the compliance section get worried about the fact that those asylum seekers are being treated in a manner that is in fact a denial of their human rights. It is no good people from the top telling people in the compliance section on the ground that all of these people are economic crooks from China&mdash;and I challenge the Department to deny that that has ever been said. It is no good making an amorphous statement such as, `There are millions and millions of Chinese and others on the move', somehow thinking that the trade winds from China will send these millions down to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On one occasion Dr John Eddy said that trade winds have been blowing for thousands of years&mdash;and how many have arrived on the soil of Australia? When the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) took certain action in respect of Port Hedland and stated quite deliberately that we wanted to send a message to others, Dr John Eddy observed that human beings should not be used as post boxes or as parcels and that human beings should be treated in accordance with their dignity as individuals whose human rights must be upheld. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not stand here bagging the Department. Overwhelmingly in that Department, in my view, there are officers who have a professional and clear understanding of the need to uphold human rights. They are, however, acting on the basis of messages that they are getting from the Minister's office and, indeed, from official statements by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the officers of the Minister's Department, Harriet Swift, was quoted, I think, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bangkok Post</EMPHASIS> as saying that if the Government were to facilitate the applications for refugee status of certain of the Cambodian asylum seekers at this stage this would imply that the Government believed that it was not safe to go back to Cambodia. That would affect the Government's foreign affairs policy in Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not got the paper with me, but I can get it. If I am wrong in saying that, the Minister will be able to get his Department to show him what, in fact, was reported. She may well have been misreported, but if that is the attitude that is being taken, then clearly the whole of the refugee question has been mixed up in foreign policy considerations. Under its various titles&mdash;the Department of Labour and Immigration, as it was; I will not go through all of the changes&mdash;the Department has done a mighty job over many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should not confuse the criteria or the numbers that are necessary or desirable to be accepted as immigrants in the migration area with the criteria or the numbers to be accepted in the refugee area. In the latter case, the numbers are not the question: the question is, where we have persons arriving in Australia or seeking asylum in Australia, whether those persons are refugees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They know whether or not they are refugees. They are the ones who will go through all of the trauma of dislocation from their own countries. Surely, they are the ones who should, in some way, be allowed to determine at what stage the actual application is made. As I will be asking in the Committee of the Whole, why impose upon certain asylum seekers a requirement to apply for refugee status within a certain time? That ignores the fact that the circumstances in the country from which they have been excluded by virtue of their race, colour, creed, political opinion and so on may change. Some people who come here may not wish to make application for refugee status, hoping that the situation in their country may change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I sincerely believe that the migration program should continue apace. The picture being painted should not affect the migration program at all. I differ strongly from the view expressed by Senator Coulter. I believe it is totally naive to suggest that we ought to stabilise our population. This country needs more people. The fact remains that if it does not get more people we will never have a self-generating economy in this country. Of course, we may not achieve that even so, but one of the biggest problems in this country so far as employment is concerned is the fact that we do not have the population base for a self-generating economy. How can we compete with, for example, the manufacturing industries in some of the industrialised countries and, in future, with some of the less developed countries which are rapidly developing their manufacturing industries? How can we compete with them when, within their own countries, they have the population which enables them to produce in a massively cheaper way because of their economies of scale?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue is resources. This country is blessed with great resources. What we need in this country&mdash;and, unfortunately, the Democrats very often oppose it&mdash;is value added industry. </PARA>

Julian Simon said, `I will bet you that that will not be the case', so they agreed upon the test of the scarcity or otherwise of resource material being its price. Of course, if it is scarce, the price will be sky high; if it is not, the price will be lower. Come 1990, on every single one of the resources the two had agreed upon, the price was lower. I think we ought to have a look at some of the outrageous and outlandish claims upon which important decisions are made. I know DILGEA and its predecessors have done a good job in many of these areas and have argued the question and put forward the viewpoint quite objectively as to how immigration affects the economic status of a particular country. There has been quite good work done by the Department in that area over a number of years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this question of the migration Bills, I fear that we are in danger of being deceived by the painting of a drastic picture, then applying strictures, and using refugees to send messages to others. I refer to the second reading speech which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the past three years the number of applications for refugee status from persons wishing to remain in Australia has grown dramatically from below 500 applications per year to a current case load of 22,500.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that was not really an appropriate way to describe the situation. The Minister is comparing apples with oranges. The Minister refers to 500 applications per year growing to a current case load of 22,500. What the Minister does not say is that, of that 22,500, there are some 18,000 PRC (temporary) entry permit holders as a result of the Tiananmen Square massacre. I will be asking the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) a number of questions during the Committee of the Whole discussion as to whether in fact the number of applications is levelling off. Whether it is or is not levelling off, each individual applicant, each individual asylum seeker, deserves to be treated in accordance with the fundamental principles of human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I refer to the `Welcome Stranger' conference that was held in Sydney from 19 to 21 June&mdash;yesterday, the day before and the evening before.

Senator Robert Hill, the Leader of the Opposition, and Senator Jim McKiernan attended the conference on Friday evening.

It also said that the major issues of concern that the churches were urged to raise with the Government include: the infringement of human rights of asylum seekers held in detention for long periods; the recent legislation that takes away the power of courts to test the legality of detention; the lack of adequate family and counselling support services for those in detention centres; and the inordinate delays in the processing of entry applications. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not delay the Senate very long in my short contribution to this debate on a number of migration Bills that are before the chamber. Senator Harradine was kind enough to acknowledge my presence at the `Welcome Stranger' conference in Sydney at the weekend. I represented the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and gave a speech on Friday evening. An essential part of that speech was an appeal that I made to the assembled audience for honesty and truth in the migration debate, and particularly the refugee issue. This is a huge issue: there are some 17 million displaced people around the world, not all of whom are, in the correct sense of the word, `refugees' as defined by the United Nations. Nonetheless, many millions of people are suffering right around the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also made the point in that speech that Australia on its own could not solve all the problems but that we certainly could make a contribution. The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) announced recently that, as part of our migration intake program, next year Australia will take some 10,000 people under the humanitarian category. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, my appeal on Friday night on behalf of the Prime Minister was not heard by one of my State colleagues in Western Australia. I note in an article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>, under the headline `Free boat people', that the State Minister for Multicultural and Ethnic Affairs, Judyth Watson, has entered this debate. Unfortunately, Dr Watson is not particularly well informed on this refugee issue. It is a matter that I hopefully will take up with Dr Watson at a later time.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motivation for me to rise to my feet in this debate this afternoon came from some comments that Senator Harradine made in his contribution.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was my understanding. If that is the case, I have taken Senator Harradine's interjection and the matter has been corrected. I want to go through the criteria very briefly for the purpose of the record. Every application for refugee status in Australia is examined on an individual, case by case basis. It is given extensive scrutiny. For an application for refugee status to be successful, it must comply with the United Nations convention in respect of refugees. Australia is a signatory to that convention and its guidelines are the ones that we, as a nation, use in determining whether or not a person is a refugee. We do not move away from that convention in any shape or form; nor should we move away from it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If individuals choose not to put in applications for 12 months or more&mdash;and some boat people have&mdash;that might say something about their democratic rights. If such a delay does occur, of course it will in turn mean a delay in a decision being given on that individual's application. But every person coming to Australia, in a boat or by whatever other means, has the opportunity of lodging an application for refugees status. That application is given detailed scrutiny. If the person is unsuccessful with that application, if it is deemed not to comply with the United Nations convention, the application will be refused. The individual then has a right to apply for a review, and can provide a lot of additional information to the refugee review council. If the individual is not successful at this stage, then he or she will have to leave Australia, and only then. But the application may indeed be successful, as some 15 out of the many hundreds of applications with the Department and the review council were last week. The applicant will either win or lose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the matter of whether or not Australia is sending messages overseas is one for other countries to determine. I think that one very strong message that should be sent to every part of the world is that in Australia individuals will not be allowed to select themselves for refugee status. The mere physical presence in Australia of a person seeking refugee status will not in itself be a criterion for approval of his or her application.

It has a responsibility to each and every one of the people who are in the unfortunate circumstance of being displaced persons, and that responsibility is fulfilled by giving them the right to make an application and, if the application is rejected, the right to a review. It has cost the taxpayers of Australia a good deal of money to fulfil those obligations, particularly with the boat people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My great concern in this refugee debate is not so much for the few hundred people who are held in detention in Australia or, indeed, for the 23,000 outstanding applications from people who are sitting out there in the community. My concern is for those millions of others, some of whom are truly refugees and have been determined to be refugees by the United Nations; for example, some 250,000 people who are sitting in camps on the border of Thailand and Cambodia. If we expressed more concern for those people and gave them more help, rather than expressing the concerns that were raised about the boat people, like Dr Watson did on the weekend, I think it would serve Australia's immigration program and our international obligations a great deal better. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I thank those honourable senators who have contributed to the debate on the Migration Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992 and related Bills. The Bills are a very important part of the Government's expression, or the nub of the Australian people's desire, that we cope with increasing pressures on our migration program, whether in relation to normal entrants or, in particular, those who claim refugee status. In that regard the provision to make it impossible for applicants for refugee status to continue to delay assessment of whether they need to depart from Australia by simply deferring lodgment of an application for refugee status is very well timed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is important as a matter of humanitarian concern that the status of those who claim to be refugees be determined in a reasonable time frame. That might be two to three months, but it certainly should not be extended for over two years, as has been the case in some instances. It is important to provide a processing regime which produces a better and more timely resolution and determination of the various claims that are made for refugee status. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the amendments in these Bills will also allow the Minister to determine processing priorities so that the processing of new applications for refugee status is not impeded by the existence of a backlog of unprocessed applications. Quite clearly, the Government wishes to eliminate any incentive for persons with no claim to refugee status to lodge ill-founded applications simply to achieve continued residence in Australia whilst awaiting processing of any other application. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Provisions have also been included to deter persons, primarily Indonesian nationals, from fishing illegally in Australian waters. I believe it is very important so far as our fishing industry, our quarantine laws and our maritime environment generally, is concerned&mdash;quite apart from illegal immigration&mdash;that we have a better regime applying to the incursions by foreign fishing vessels into Australian waters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know it has been a matter of some comment by various people that when these fishermen are put into detention or imprisoned, or put into custody of some sort, and are paid what to an Australian would be a very small weekly amount&mdash;that is, what would be a prisoner's entitlement in, say, Western Australia&mdash;the small gratuities paid can be a significant amount of money to the Indonesian fishermen who rather regard the whole matter, it is said, as something of a paid holiday in that respect. These people are then sent back to Indonesia and, as individuals, they have not suffered any great adverse economic impact as a result of the experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments will render any crew member of an apprehended fishing vessel liable for the cost of his custody and removal from Australia. That seems to be a very sensible arrangement. The small amount that could be payable during imprisonment will be offset against the debt incurred for custody and removal from Australia. The capacity to confiscate fishing vessels, which affects the owner or the master of the vessel more than the crew members, and the imposition of gaol sentences will be increased disincentives for fishermen to fish illegally in Australian waters, and that must be to our benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as business migration is concerned, there is a very real need to have a mandatory system of monitoring the real contribution to business activities of those who arrive in Australia under the business migration scheme, so the provision is very welcome. It is also linked to the fact that the Minister will be able to cancel permanent entry permits and entry visas of business skills migrants after their arrival in Australia if they do not enter into business activities which meet the objectives of the category or make a genuine effort to do so. I think that is over a period of three years. In that situation, I believe that Australians would expect that those who abuse this program would be politely shown the door after the situation has been identified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also some provisions in the Bill which provide for people who make false or misleading statements or produce bogus documents or those with highly dangerous and communicable diseases or criminal records. Entry into Australia of all those sorts of persons is undesirable and the present section 20 of the Act defines those categories. People who fall into those categories are defined as illegal entrants unless they are excused for some reason or another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The intention of the Government was always&mdash;and it has been asserted that this was the intention of the legislation originally&mdash;to bring about a situation in which a person who has committed a series of unrelated crimes but who has been sentenced in total to a period of 12 months or more imprisonment overseas should be categorised as a person whose entry into Australia is undesirable. That is a person to whom section 20 should apply. The amendment which has been put forward this afternoon will make this longstanding policy of the Government clear and overcome the narrow interpretation of the Federal Court without retrospectively trying to undo that decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other important Bill that we are dealing with this afternoon, the Migration Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1992, gives effect to the scheme for the registration of migration agents. It is designed to improve the professionalism and the standard of service of those who help and assist, as many do in a genuine way, those who require some assistance in filling out their forms and applications. It is a fact that amongst such agents are those who prey on certain ethnic communities and who are unscrupulous, at worst, or perhaps merely incompetent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The complaints that many of us in this chamber are familiar with are now recognised in this Bill. It attempts to protect those in our society who are most vulnerable, who very often have a poor grasp of English, a fear of authority because of unfortunate experiences or the cultural or social situation in their homeland, and meagre financial resources. Even those meagre financial resources can be the object of greed of those with predatory instincts in some of those communities which prey on the vulnerability of such persons. We know of many cases in which applications have been lodged in a very tardy way, which adversely affects the application. There have been instances of these so-called migration agents holding passports as security and then demanding extra payment before they will return the passport. That is not an uncommon experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In considering this situation, the Government carried out very extensive consultation with ethnic community organisations, community based migration advice agencies and the legal profession, resulting in the scheme being developed. The central feature of the scheme is the establishment of the Migration Agents Registration Board, which will have the power to issue warnings, to suspend, to deregister, and to refuse applications for registration. It will comprise ministerially appointed representatives from industry, the legal profession, the ethnic community and the Immigration Review Tribunal. It will be chaired by the Secretary to the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs or a nominee of the Secretary. Such things as investigations and application assessments will be conducted in the strictest confidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The code of conduct&mdash;a critical element of the scheme&mdash;is still being refined but it will be prescribed by regulation and, therefore, will be a disallowable instrument and will come before this chamber if honourable senators wish to examine it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These migration agents are defined in a way which makes it clear&mdash;Senator Macdonald was not entirely happy with the distinction&mdash;that there is a distinction between such persons and lawyers who simply offer legal advice which is unrelated to the completion and lodgment of applications. If lawyers assist in the making of a visa or entry application under the Migration Act, they should register as migration agents. Despite Senator Macdonald's misgivings about this, it is interesting to note that in the House of Representatives on Tuesday, 2 June the Opposition spokesman on immigration and ethnic affairs, Mr Ruddock, put it beyond any doubt that the Opposition shared the understanding of the Minister in relation to the need for lawyers in certain situations to be registered and, therefore, the Opposition supported this particular provision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it was important that the Government should reduce the levy payable in those instances where, as Senator Macdonald said, a lawyer, as a small part of his or her practice, deals with three or four matters a year where people come in and ask for assistance. The levy of $1,000 would be too high in relation to the fees generated and the service provided to those few applicants who were assisted. Therefore, there are two different scales: those migration agents who deal with five cases or fewer will pay only a $100 fee; and the levy for those who deal with six cases or more will be $1,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had representations from lawyers in Hobart who might do two or three cases a year. For them to pay a $1,000 registration fee would have meant that they would have declined to assist a person who came to them for advice in relation to the making of an application and help in filling out particular forms. That would have forced the work into the hands of those larger firms or migration agents who are prepared to deal with dozens, perhaps even hundreds, of cases and for whom the $1,000 registration fee would only be a small part of the costs of providing that service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that these Bills are very important as part of Australia's response to the need to regulate in a proper way the entry of those who come to this nation. I commend the Bills to the Senate. </PARA>

We now have only 10 minutes left for the whole of the committee stage. That does not enable us to consider amendments to ensure that that circumstance is taken into account.

I do not know whether it was as of 5 May or as of now that Senator Harradine was speaking, so it may well be that `as soon as practicable' should take into account the advanced stage of the pregnancy and the need to ensure that the child en ventre sa mere be given every consideration rather than the mother be forced to travel back in that situation. One would hope that that phraseology about practicability would permit consideration and due weight and significance to be attached to the advanced stage of the pregnancy of the woman concerned rather than sending her back at the stage where the dire consequences to which Senator Harradine points might be visited upon the advanced stage of the child in the womb.</PARA></TALK.START>

Some Africans have arrived in Australia with bogus documents and that was the only reason they were able to escape from where they were coming from. How is the Department to assess that situation? Is there any discretion in regard to bogus documents and false statements, or is it a fact that anyone who produces a bogus document or makes a false statement will suffer the inherent penalty as provided for in clause 5?</PARA></TALK.START>

It prevents applications for a determination of refugee status being made by a person who is outside Australia. What is the practical effect of that? Senator McKiernan talked about the people in refugee camps who are considered by the UNHCR as being refugees. I agree that that is a great problem, but this provision appears to limit the opportunity of those people to make an application for refugee status. Therefore, presumably it goes against what Senator McKiernan was suggesting we ought to be concerned with. The point is that, if these applications can be made only by persons who are inside Australia, what effect does this have?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President, and my parliamentary colleagues. I can best express why I am here today, what I want to see accomplished for Australia and what I personally want to realise as a senator by simply telling honourable senators something of my past. I live near a small township called Weetulta. I am sure no-one here has ever heard of it, except perhaps for some of my South Australian colleagues. It is a two-hour drive from Adelaide and even most South Australians do not know it exists. In fact, it is home to just 10 people&mdash;forgotten people in many respects, certainly forgotten in terms of geographic equality.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The residents of many small rural towns to reach home have to drive over many kilometres of dirt road, their main road. If we need a doctor or a chemist for a sick child, the closest is 16 kilometres away, and we are more fortunate than most. As a parent, to ensure that child then has access to the necessary school curriculum and further education has become almost an impossibility without crippling financial outlays. For many rural families, it is an impossibility, and they watch the frustration of teenagers as they are unable to reach their education potential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In today's highly technological age, it is a fallacy to believe that rural communities can survive without a higher degree of learning than has been necessary in the past. These children have as much right to access education as their peers in the city. The rural communities need in turn to access the knowledge for the future that their children acquire. But it is a sad fact that in 1992, in a country whose Government has christened it the clever country, we practise blatant geographic discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember my primary education at the Weetulta rural school, a one-teacher school with seven grades and no ancillary staff. There were between 15 and 19 students there attending at any one time. During the middle stages of my years at that school, there were only three students in year 7. One of those students was my elder brother, now a senior partner in an Adelaide law firm; the second student is now the head of the psychology department at Melbourne University; and the third became a triple certificated sister who topped the State in her final year. In another year was my younger sister who later studied at the Conservatorium, and as a Bachelor of Music is now head of the music department in an Adelaide school. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could list many similar examples of such career successes from my fellow pupils during my years at Weetulta. But in the early 1970s that school closed. One of the spurious reasons given was that students of small rural schools were being deprived of opportunities to compete and succeed. Compare the successes from the many small schools such as Weetulta with the plight of rural students today where in rural South Australia only one in 20 is able to access tertiary education or training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government may talk long about equal opportunity but it falls far short of this when it comes to reality. Just two hours out of Adelaide there is another Australia&mdash;an Australia which blatantly, through government policies, is denied equal opportunity for its citizens. That discrimination has increased significantly since I was a boy&mdash;not decreased. I think politicians, being pragmatic, have described it as a rationalisation of expenditure. But that is not what it is. It is actually the systematic devaluation of the rural communities of Australia. And what hypocrisy from a Labor Government embarking on overseas tourism promotions which describe rural and outback Australia as the `real Australia', while at home it does its best to make life difficult for those who live and work there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a farmer from a long line of farmers, as a father who has watched three talented daughters make sacrifices in the name of further education, and as a committed Liberal, I was no longer prepared to sit back and let others fight the rural battle for me. So I say: here I am, the first rural South Australian senator for many years. I am here principally because I want to halt what is happening to rural Australia and I want to help turn policy around. I want recognition, especially in Canberra, that families outside the major cities are not second-class citizens. They have the same right for their basic needs to be met as do city dwellers. The cities need rural communities for what we produce as much as we need them for what they manufacture and assemble, and therefore we should be treated as equals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely there is not a senator in this chamber today who can condone a situation like one I heard of recently in South Australia. The principal of a rural high school broke down in tears. He had a son who was clever, a son who wanted to access a university education. But this father, with other children to support, with no family in Adelaide for his son to live with, could not afford the large outlay that his son would need to rent accommodation and study away from home. The amount of Austudy available just did not provide for even the basic necessities. So another rural teenager does not reach his potential, either for himself or for what he could have contributed back to our society. Who knows what we are losing for Australia because of this geographical discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am a religious person, and I am proud of the values that religion has instilled in me. But nowhere have I come across anything to suggest that God has signified that the educated should be congregated in the cities. Yet here we have a government playing God with people's lives and making just that assumption. I do not believe that government has that right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other assumption that the present Government especially has embraced is that rural communities are not really poor: they are just pretend poor, or so temporarily poor that they are not worthy of understanding or more than token levels of help. Let me tell honourable senators from hard and at times heartbreaking personal experience that the sporadic good times no longer make up for the many bad. They did at one time&mdash;of course they did; that is, before the constant low commodity prices, before the long run of high interest rate years, before vastly increased government taxes and charges, and before the unfair trading practices of the United States and the European Community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose that, keeping a very essential sense of humour, I can sum up life on the Australian farm with the story of a farmer who won $1m in X lotto. When asked, `What are you going to do with all the money?', he replied, `I guess I'll probably just keep on farming until it's all gone'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For all of those reasons, my commitment to redefining the place of the rural community in the formulation of policy in Canberra is total, as is my commitment to Liberal philosophies. To me, Liberal philosophies are about the kind of Australia we want for our families to live in and for individuals to achieve in. It is vitally important that we encourage the individual at every level, that we reward exceptional performance and that we support and encourage those who want to work harder in order to produce more and earn more in whatever field they work in, from the factory floor to the executive suite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Being Liberal is not about winning for the sake of winning. It is about winning to deliver an industrial lifestyle conducive to individuals having the freedom from government and union shackles to succeed in their place of work. It is about winning to deliver taxation reforms&mdash;bold and controversial&mdash;so that families take home more of what they earn, with the choice of whether to spend or save. It is about winning so that our society can be economically restructured with fairness, right away from the excesses of the 1980s where so many suffered because of the actions of a few; where evil did, for a time, triumph over good; and greed triumphed over commonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two words which drew me into the Liberal Party in the first place&mdash;`freedom' and `family'&mdash;are still the core of Liberal policy development. To me, as I determined to seek preselection for the Senate, it seemed they were, unfortunately, also at the very core of Labor Government policy, but that it was bent on their destruction. The freedom of choice to exercise one's rights is surely so fundamental in a Western democracy that I cannot come to terms with a government which supports and encourages compulsory unionism; destroys the basic right of freedom of speech by banning political advertising; and now intends to conscript by legislation the payment of wage increases through increased superannuation contributions by employers. That is not government in the best interests of the people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have not seen government in the best interests of the family unit either. I am prepared to wear the hat of `old fashioned' if that is what it takes to fight for what I sincerely believe is the soul of any community&mdash;the family. My family is here today. They mean a lot to me, and their support and encouragement are vital to me. I do know how fortunate I am to be part of a happy family unit. But I also know that I am delivering this speech against a backdrop of family unit disintegration right across Australia. Every welfare organisation in the country is indicating that marriage has been one of the most catastrophic casualties of the present recession. A lost job, the colossal stress that goes with it and, in many cases, also the loss of the family home have created tensions many previously happy marriages have just not been able to survive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we know from the horrific youth unemployment statistics, many families are trying to cope with a double blow as their children leave school, often to join their parents in the lengthening dole queues. I looked at the bankruptcy statistics in the light of the welfare agencies' comments and I wondered how many of the 13,556 bankruptcies in the first nine months of the 1991-92 financial year will translate also into broken marriages and how many more distressed children there will be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of the blame for such disintegration of the family unit lies at the feet of Labor economic policy. I strongly believe in, and will fight for, a taxation system which recognises and even displays a preference towards the family unit. I have long admired John Howard's stance on this issue and agree totally with him that a taxation system which is neutral when it comes to family dependence is economic purity gone mad. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who support members of their family should get taxation help for doing so. If we believe in the value of the family unit in our society, it is not enough just to say so. We have to act to help to preserve it in policy formulation across all areas of government. That has been totally ignored. The subsequent erosion of that unit during a decade of Labor has been substantial. It will not, unfortunately, be able to be redressed quickly but it is important to me, what I believe in and what I was brought up to believe in, to ensure that it is redressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite obvious to me that the breakdown of the discipline of family life has been a contributing factor to the many social problems confronting society today. It is only too obvious in South Australia. As everyone in this chamber knows, unemployment in my home State is at 12.4 per cent, the worst of any State and the worst State figures on record&mdash;all this from the joint efforts of a Federal and a State government which claim a policy of social justice. In the past decade of Labor rule in South Australia, all social justice has meant is the delivering of more overwhelming poverty to a greater number of families, destroying many in the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Forty-five per cent of our youth in South Australia are unemployed. The rural youth unemployment statistics are often hidden because of those young people who have, frequently in desperation, left the area to try their luck in Adelaide. But most do not have the luck to find work there either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many other factors of Federal and State Labor rule in South Australia which indicate the destruction by poverty of the family structure. Housing Trust waiting lists have almost doubled to more than 43,000 since John Bannon became Premier. Rent relief recipients have increased by a massive 72 per cent&mdash;many of those are single parent families. South Australian child-care centres say they receive between one and 10 cases each day of children who are either malnourished, inadequately clothed or otherwise neglected. I have been told that child poverty in South Australia would now exceed some 30,000, courtesy of a party which promised us no child poverty by 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our electricity is the second most expensive after Western Australia. A national report indicated that our public transport system was the worst of any State. Our State taxes and fees under Labor have increased at a rate 34 per cent faster than Australia as a whole. Is it any wonder that so many South Australian families are just not surviving as a unit with all those pressures and abysmal and expensive government charges and services? As well, Labor policies&mdash;or perhaps I should say a decade of lack of policy&mdash;for our manufacturing structure have left us the most economically vulnerable State. Economic research indicates that we are the State least likely to weather any further economic downturn and the State least likely to be able to recover significantly as the economy picks up. We have both Federal and State Labor governments to thank for this mess. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me, as I have watched from the political sidelines for a number of years, that Labor governments have quite forgotten or deliberately ignored the fact that their policy formulation is affecting lives, children and families. I want in my time in the Senate to make a significant contribution to try to aid those families across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank honourable senators on both sides of the chamber for the warmth of their welcome to Canberra. It certainly makes up for some of the sub-zero mornings that I am not quite used to. As a new senator, I would hope to live by a saying that has stayed in my mind for many years: `The service we give to others is the rent we pay for our place on earth'.

Why did the Government not say that in its explanatory memorandum? It did not say that. The Government ought to come clean and be very clear in the explanatory memorandum.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Health, Housing and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill is an omnibus Bill that includes provisions that relate to all aspects of the health, housing and community services portfolio. It amends the First Home Owners Act by correcting an anomaly in the Act whereby the failure of a person to supply a tax file number resulted in the suspension and cancellation of all future benefits irrespective of whether the tax file number was supplied at a later date. The amendment will allow for the resumption of payments immediately upon the tax file number being made available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also contains a number of measures to improve the administration of nursing homes. Nursing home residents will now be able to use up to two days of their 28 non-hospital leave days immediately prior to entering the home. I have been arguing for this amendment for some time, for the sake of both the incoming residents and the staff. On too many occasions I have been told by directors of nursing, especially in small rural nursing homes and in rural areas, that they have had to fill empty beds almost before they were cold from the previous residents; otherwise the nursing home would lose money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see you smile, Madam Acting Deputy President. I will give one example of a small rural nursing home which was so strapped for cash that a brother passed away and his sister was admitted to the nursing home that same afternoon because the nursing home is only paid for the day people go in, not the day they go out. I asked whether money could be paid for the day on which the person died so that at least his sister did not have to go into his bed that night, and so that the staff could accommodate the fact that somebody they had been looking after for years was no longer with them when they changed shifts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thank heavens the Government has found a way, without cost, of allowing residents two days notice in which they can fix up their affairs before they go into the nursing home, and so that at least the staff have time to accommodate the fact that one of their residents has passed away. The amendment introduces the kind of flexibility we have been asking for for a long time. I commend the Government for getting around to it at this stage in a way that is acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also allows the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services to provide prospective purchasers of nursing homes with information about the Commonwealth benefits advanced to that home. Previously, information was not able to be divulged and the proprietor was able to underspend the benefit and sell the nursing home before the overpayment could be identified. This amendment allows the purchaser to be fully informed about the sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The secrecy provision amendments enable the Department to divulge key information to receivers or liquidators. The Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) has claimed that the current secrecy provisions have limited the Department's ability to deal effectively and cooperatively with receivers or liquidators, making it difficult to act in the interests of nursing home residents. Given the appalling number of nursing homes&mdash;and we are led to believe it is as many as 50 per cent&mdash;in or nearing receivership in Victoria, it is no wonder the Minister has introduced this amendment, but the Minister still refuses to acknowledge that there is a problem, particularly in private nursing homes in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has a responsibility to ensure that sufficient funding is available. If it restricts the funds available to nursing homes from other sources, it is up to this Government to provide greater funding so that the financial stability of the nursing homes is ensured. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last Budget the Government announced a new personal care assessment instrument, the PCAI, for hostel funding. Earlier this year when the restructure of the personal care subsidy was passed by the Parliament, I recall expressing my concern about it. The Minister said that the restructured personal care subsidy would provide clear incentives for hostels to provide care for more highly dependent and confused people, consistent with the objectives of the aged care strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new arrangements have only been in place for six weeks and, unfortunately, already they are causing considerable anxiety in the industry. There are concerns about the increased administration involved; about the fact that hostel residents who have good ADL skills&mdash;activities and daily living skills&mdash;but behavioural problems will often not qualify even for the lower subsidy; and about the fact that the hostels that were receiving dementia grants believe that the cut-back in those grants will not be offset by any increase in the personal care subsidy.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That issue was being raised with me a long time before the PCAI was introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real concern is that reduced subsidies will lead to inadequate care for those who need it and those whom the Government supposedly targeted with this change. I call on the Minister and his Department to examine the recently introduced changes and ensure that they do not inadvertently lead to a lower standard of care in hostels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of changes related to the health portfolio are also included in this Bill. These include changes in payments and penalties related to pathology services and the investigation of overservicing in radiology. They extend the pharmaceutical benefits safety net scheme to include medications dispensed from State hospitals. I might just add that this is well overdue. They also make a number of technical amendments to acknowledge that health funds are now known as registered health benefit organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also removes the obligation for details of the borrowings by the Hearing Services Authority to be laid before both Houses of the Parliament. The only reason advanced for this change is that the borrowings of the Authority are small and that the paperwork involved in tabling the details is not warranted. The coalition thinks differently and feels that, unless a more substantive reason is given, the right of the Parliament should be upheld. Consequently, we will be opposing this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also makes a number of amendments to the Therapeutic Goods Act, including the widening of the definition of `therapeutic device' to include devices such as breast implants. Unfortunately, I do not have time to go into these other amendments. However, they are sensible and are supported by both the therapeutic goods and devices industry bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot let this opportunity pass without raising another issue in the therapeutic goods area which I have been following for some time&mdash;the issue of the grandfathering of imported therapeutic goods products. A company in the heart of the Hotham electorate in which my office is situated has had to put off workers. This company has had long running problems with therapeutic goods administration. Headway seems to have been made in respect of export certification, but there are still problems with imported products. The parent company wants to put a large sum of money into capital investment in Australia. However, it is reluctant to do so because of the tardiness in dealings with therapeutic goods administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The grandfathering of imported goods has been an issue of great concern. The original promise was that grandfathered products would have to face the same stringent tests as therapeutic goods produced in Australia. I think the first promise was made in August 1991. The Minister then promised that it would be done by 15 February this year. I have been advised that those importers were written letters in April and told that this would be done in the next six months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the interim, firms which produce in Australia are competing with therapeutic goods that may not reach the good manufacturing practice standards. That is not good enough. Can the Department and the Minister explain why, almost a year after their first promise, we are still waiting for this to happen? I urge the Minister and the Department to ensure that everything is done to speed up the process of considering these grandfathered products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other major amendments in this Bill relates to the reversal of the co-payment. In the Budget last year the Government announced the introduction of a $3.50 co-payment for general practitioner consultations. Following an outcry from the left wing of the Labor Party, the introduction of the co-payment was delayed until 1 December and the co-payment for bulkbilled GP consultations was reduced to $2.50. The co-payment was a sensible way to prevent overuse and over-servicing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Co-payments increase the incentive for patients to use services judiciously and to monitor potential over-servicing by medical practitioners. However, the co-payment lasted only three months before it became a victim in the Labor leadership battle between Hawke and Keating. Keating promised that, as leader, the co-payment would be dropped. His targets were those left wing members of the Party who had vigorously opposed the co-payment. Senator Crowley was used as the Keating messenger in the leadership struggle to deliver the vote grabbing promise. The promise had nothing to do with the effect that the co-payment was having on access, equity or cost; it was politics all the way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I feel sorry&mdash;if I can feel sorry&mdash;for Minister Howe who had worn all the odium of introducing a co-payment. He was sold down the tube for a couple of votes&mdash;talk about a few shekels of silver! As he promised, Keating scrapped the GP co-payment to pay back a couple of supporters for the few votes he needed to scrape into the leadership. I bet there are some people on the other side who maybe wished they had never done that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a joint statement issued by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services, Brian Howe, it was claimed that the reversal would remove the uncertainty about the health system and address concerns about a decline in bulkbilling. However, Minister Howe knew this not to be true. When asked at a doorstep interview whether the co-payment was a burden on the health system, Minister Howe refused to acknowledge that it was because he knew it was not. His Department had figures showing that the co-payment was not a burden and that there was clear support for the Medicare change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Four surveys commissioned by the Department and conducted by AGB Australia were dragged out of the Department and supplied to me during Estimates committee hearings. The total cost of these four reports was $87,000 and the findings make very interesting reading. Of those surveyed, 82 per cent thought it was important or very important to restrain the costs of Medicare. Of the three options open to people to keep down the increasing costs of Medicare, 23 per cent preferred an increase in the Medicare levy; 6 per cent preferred an increase in personal income tax; 59 per cent preferred a $3.50 co-payment; and 13 per cent did not know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, 53 per cent thought the co-payment would be effective or very effective in keeping the costs of Medicare down and 27 per cent thought it would be ineffective or very ineffective. Further, 66 per cent of people said they would not go to another practice in their area if their present GP introduced the $3.50 fee and another did not; 31 per cent said they would change. Seventy-three per cent of those interviewed said that a co-payment would be more acceptable to them if it were used to cover the costs of improvements to health services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Few doctors reported discontinuing bulkbilling for pensioners or other card holders. Also, 28 per cent of consumers thought that an extra charge would make them consider more carefully about going to a doctor; 25 per cent of people said that they were likely to review their decision to visit a GP for minor needs but were unlikely to do so for major medical needs; and only 5 per cent said that they may review their decision to visit a doctor for major medical needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The survey also revealed that despite some concern expressed about recent changes to Medicare, support for specific changes made to Medicare remained high, with a large majority judging the co-payment as reasonable to encourage more careful use of medical services. It found that the co-payment was in line with community attitudes. Seventy-two per cent of people said that patients should make some payment themselves towards the cost of a visit to a GP. Poor Mr Howe! He was on a winner&mdash;people agreed that they should be charged. But he has to give it up for a couple of votes because Mr Keating did a deal. I would like to have heard his comments behind the scene. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is only limited information available on the effect of co-payment on the billing practices of GPs. But on the information available, there was an initial decline in the number of GPs bulkbilling of 3 to 4 per cent. Over the three months that the co-payment was operating, this decline in bulkbilling was reversed. When the co-payment was dropped at the end of February 1992, the proportion of claims bulkbilled was back to the figure prior to implementation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All those screaming left wing Labor members could not wait to see the effect of the co-payment on the health system. Not only was there significant support for the co-payment, but the effect on bulkbilling was almost negligible. Scrapping it cost Australians hundreds of millions of dollars. The loss of savings in 1991-92 will be in the order of $71.6m; in 1992-93, $277.4m; in 1993-94, $480.4m; and in 1994-95, $666.6m. Ask all those medical researchers, all those people who want equipment and all those hospitals which would like some of that money&mdash;they will tell us that the public agreed with the co-payment. The price of $71m this financial year will go up through the years to $666m in 1994. That is what those votes for Mr Keating cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to figures supplied in Estimates, the co-payment had saved $70.1m in the three months that it was in operation. All Australians are paying for this decision and for the votes of a couple of left wing Labor members. Even the Industry Commission in its report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Exports of Health Services</EMPHASIS>, which was completed in December 1991 but not released until after Prime Minister Keating and Caucus dropped the co-payment, supported the use of co-payments for health services. So another interesting point is that the report was not released until after the co-payment was dropped. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has a long term commitment to achieving a better deal for people with disabilities, having begun the process of expanding opportunities in 1983 with a comprehensive review of programs and services&mdash;the handicapped programs review. The outcomes of this review culminated in the implementation of the Disability Services Act, which is recognised as being at the forefront of disability reform worldwide. Many of us took part in those consultations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember with some pleasure the first occasion on which I saw a plane travelling from Melbourne to Perth with six or eight quite severely disabled people occupying a good half of the first-class seats. The people with disabilities coped with the trip perfectly well but, this being 1983, the flight attendants were quite unused to such an environment and reached Perth quite stressed, to my amusement. That would not happen today. It is perfectly normal, natural and acceptable, and quite common, to see people in wheelchairs and those with other disabilities making use of public and other transport. It is no longer a matter for amazement or even comment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of the Disability Services Act was a historic first step in providing a framework for developing a range of support services, setting the scene for the achievement of increased independence, greater employment opportunities and fuller integration into community activities for people with disabilities. Since the introduction of the Disability Services Act in 1987, significant progress has been made in many areas. The national attendant care scheme has enabled about 300 people with severe physical disabilities to return home to the community after a lifetime of institutional care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Competitive employment training and placement services represent a successful approach to assisting people with disabilities to find, gain and hold jobs in the open labour market. This scheme has been expanded recently to cater for people with psychiatric disabilities. Individual supported jobs is a similar employment venture which assists people to undertake jobs in the open labour market. I am reminded here of a project, small in scope but very effective, which commenced in Geraldton about 12 months ago and has a splendid record of placing people with intellectual disabilities in employment in Geraldton and the surrounding area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have not focused on bricks and mortar and total support such as hostel accommodation. DSA funded services are concentrating on providing personal and in-home care to maintain people with disabilities where they are or where they would prefer to be. The availability of respite care is crucial. There has been a considerable development of advocacy and consumer rights under the DSA. These successes show us that people with disabilities can live and work in the community. They demonstrate that the objects of the Act are achievable and that the principles and objectives remain vitally important in guiding appropriate service options. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a number of extremely interesting examples. One concerns a young man whom we will call Ben. Before the introduction of the Act, he lived in a residential institution and worked in a sheltered workshop on the same site as the institution. He had little choice about his life. The staff made all his decisions for him. Most of the time he just watched television. His work in the workshop was very repetitive. He spent all day putting serviettes and plastic spoons into airline bags. He was paid less than $40 a week and the conditions were poor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the introduction of the Disability Services Act in 1987, which set out the principles and objectives that I referred to before, Ben was faced with a number of important changes in his life. The first was the relocation of the workshop to another site. For the first time, his home life and his working life were separate from each other, just as they are for everybody else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The residential service was also required to provide support in community houses rather than in large, segregated institutions. Ben received help from officers of the then Department of Community Services and Health who helped to progressively change the service which was caring for him to meet the principles of the Act. With extra transition funding provided by the Department, one of the project officers who visited the institution was able to help Ben carry out his desire to live on his own in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was told about and helped to gain access to the new attendant care scheme, which is funded by the Department. Although he took some time to adjust to living in the community after spending so long in an institution with everything done for him every day, it brought forth new challenges and, for the first time, he was making his own decisions. It was a very exciting state of affairs for him. At the same time, he had the opportunity to try, to fail and to learn by his experiences like everybody else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ben was still in the sheltered workshop, but beginning to think that he should be able to get a better and more demanding job. The project officer who had been close to him throughout his transition to more independent living encouraged Ben to contact the service operated by Competitive Employment Training and Placement. He was provided by CETP with some clerical training, eventually finding a job in a lawyer's office. The service provided regular training to Ben to help him stay on top of the job and also help his co-workers to accept Ben for what he was&mdash;a person first and disabled second. His co-workers also realised that they would have to be on their toes to keep up with Ben because, like many people in similar circumstances, he was revelling in being able to finally show what he could really do. He now has a wide group of friends and has the financial independence and confidence to truly have control over all aspects of his life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many other people like Ben who are still working in sheltered workshops in poor conditions for little pay who also want to have the opportunity to get real jobs and real wages and live a real life.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government recognises that for some people with high support needs, neither employment in the open labour market nor supported employment may be the most appropriate options at this time and a range of supports will be required. For people for whom employment is not an option, we fund community access and support programs under the independent living training class of eligible services. Experience has shown that people who are considered at one stage to have no employment options at all, in the long term, given the opportunity to make decisions for themselves, given the benefit of improved technology and given the benefit of individual support and encouragement, may develop the capacity to be employed either in the open market or certainly with some support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Western Australia has a splendid example of people who have high support needs in Nulsen Haven, a facility for profoundly intellectually disabled people, some also with physical disabilities. I saw this facility over the years during the time I was a trade union official covering the workers in the facility. Ten or 12 years ago the only option for many of the people in this particular place was  confinement, which was traditional and acceptable at that stage and the only way of protecting the individuals from the self-injuries to which, in many cases, they were prone. </PARA>

This was unthinkable before the Disabilities Services Act and the provisions under the Act subsequently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The change of course has been a grave challenge to many families who had never thought of their disabled children, who are now adults, as being able to be independent to any degree. They were often convinced that such a change was impossible. Their children now have a new found dignity and are learning new skills. Some are attending classes and creating all sorts of things. They are also expanding their social skills. In many cases they are changing their behaviour quite dramatically simply as a result of being taken out of an institution and given some responsibility for their own lives and behaviour, with the support that they need. This process needs considerable resources, highly skilled staff and sincere commitment on the part of the authority concerned. I congratulate, not for the first time, the staff and management of Nulsen Haven and officers of the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services for the way in which this process has been carried out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have friends with severe physical impairments and who are wheelchair bound for a variety of reasons, including progressive neurone disease. Some have been in institutions for most of their lives, their disabilities being so severe as to have been previously considered as manageable only in such an environment. They have grown to adulthood with other people making all of the important decisions about their lives. Their needs are principally for help with showering and dressing, some needing more attention, some less. Two were the client representatives on the council of the institution in which they lived when it moved towards transition and democratisation with a special grant for this purpose, including the services of a full time officer of the Department attuned to the potential abilities of these clients. </PARA>

Some groups are self-sufficient to the point where an occasional visit from the community nurse is all that is required. At the other extreme, 24-hour care is required, and this has been shown to be feasible. The enhancement of self-reliance, morale and psychological well-being is immeasurable. Once again, it is a great credit to the authority, which has moved with the times, with the encouragement of the Department and the goodwill and very hard work of a number of officers along the way. Once again, to the departmental officers and, most of all, the clients, some of whom are more than capable of income generating activities, congratulations are due. </PARA>

For the first time in their lives they have had the opportunity to choose the people who care for them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Health, Housing and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 contains some very significant measures, most of which are supported by the Australian Democrats.

We are also very pleased to see the extension of the safety net arrangements for the pharmaceutical benefits scheme to include medication supplied through the outpatient departments of State public hospitals.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in my time tonight I wish to speak mainly about the provisions in the Bill which amend the Disability Services Act. I want to make it clear at the outset that the Democrats have generally been supporters of the Disability Services Act and its underlying philosophy, although we have repeatedly called on this Government to adequately fund this whole Act. On several occasions we have resisted Opposition amendments similar to some of those which are before us tonight. However, I wish to flag at this point in time that, presuming agreement will be reached between now and when we get into the committee stage on the precise wording of the amendment, we think it is now even more important that we support the first amendment moved by the Opposition, as the Opposition has now indicated after due consideration that it will not be considering our amendment. We will deal with that in greater detail in the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps this matter also can be dealt with in committee, but I note that we will not be supporting those Opposition amendments which actually relate to the inclusion of sheltered workshops in the Disability Services Act. We have stated that position consistently and will not be changing our minds at this stage. It is regrettable that we still have problems here. Obviously, the transition phase is difficult, but we do not believe what the Opposition is suggesting is the way that we solve these difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the main issue I wish to discuss tonight is the proposed changes to the objects of the Disability Services Act. The Bill proposes to alter the wording of the objects of the Act away from `ensuring' that people with disabilities have access to services towards `assisting' them to receive services. Regardless of whatever slant the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) and his Department might like to put on it, the words being proposed clearly represent a downgrading in the provision of services under the Act. In one swoop, we have gone from `to ensure that persons with disabilities receive the services necessary to enable them to achieve their maximum potential as members of the community' to `to assist persons with disabilities to receive the services necessary to enable them to work towards full participation as members of the community'. There is a very big difference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has been giving us mixed messages about these changes. First of all, when we inquired we were told that they were minor, they were superficial and there was really nothing to worry about. But, as we looked into this more and more, there came the realisation that they certainly were not minor or superficial and there was nothing to worry about. Indeed, in the Standing Committee hearing on this Bill Senator Tate himself conceded that the changes were, in fact, significant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not care how much the Government now wants to play this whole issue down, but if we put those changes together with some of the internal memos we have seen from the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service&mdash;and these were available to us in the Standing Committee on Community Affairs&mdash;it is very clear that the aim of these changes is to allow the Government, and in particular the CRS, to move away from a commitment to `ensure'&mdash;within financial constraints, of course&mdash;and that there will be a downgrading in the provision of services to people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I stress that statement, `within financial constraints' because the line that the Government is running is that it needs these changes because the legislation as it stands could be construed by the Federal Court as conferring an entitlement to service which could have a major budgetary impact. I ask the Minister, in his summary of the second reading debate, to explain to us whether, indeed, there is legal advice and, if there is, could he please table that advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe it is entirely speculative as there has been no such decision by the Federal Court. It is by no means certain that the Court would arrive at such a decision anyway, especially as it is clear from section 35 of the Disability Services Act that there is a limited appropriation available for the Act. It might be wiser to wait for such an occasion to arise and put up a good argument before the Court, rather than change the objects of the Act and risk sending a contentious, unacceptable and very unsettling and upsetting message to the disability community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, it is obvious in any area where the Government provides services that there are finite resources. Decisions are made every day about who gets priority of access and who waits on which list. Indeed, that also goes for the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service, which has a waiting list for service. As Senator Tate acknowledged in the Senate Committee, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal already takes into account the issue of available resources when reaching its decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the disability community understand this. Although, of course, they constantly argue for a greater overall level of funding, they certainly understand that there are finite resources, which means that not everyone who is entitled to a specific service will receive it immediately when it is actually needed. But they do know that the objects of the Act, as they presently stand, recognise a clear commitment from the Government to provide services for people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These changes give a signal to people with disabilities that the Government no longer feels the same level of obligation and that it now wants to offer a lower standard of commitment. I believe that these changes quite clearly do not favour claimants to service under the Act and that they reduce the onus on those administering the Act. It is obvious that claimants will have fewer grounds to appeal. I can only say that the tone of one of the CRS memos presented to the Committee, which spoke of having difficulty with wilful decisions of the AAT, suggests to me that this is precisely what these amendments are intended to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I am also concerned that this change is designed to enable government to move certain services for people with disabilities further away from being public services, more towards being private or business oriented services. I believe this approach is inappropriate, undesirable and certainly unnecessary in this area. Unfortunately, it seems to be a fashionable article of faith among some senior managers in the Public Service that a so-called business oriented approach can apply equally well to the delivery of services such as these as it does, for example, to the supply of electricity. The Democrats do not accept this line of thought. We reject the Government's attempts to advance such a flawed approach by undermining the objects of the Disability Services Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also point out&mdash;and I will be asking the Minister for his opinions on this&mdash;that, as the States are expected to develop their own legislation complementary to the Disability Services Act, what we are doing tonight could have repercussions on the delivery of services within the States. I ask the Minister whether he could respond to this aspect of those changes in the course of this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the changes to the objects of the Act have significance beyond the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service, it was CRS workers, through the Public Sector Union, who brought this issue to the notice of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs. The PSU was concerned that the CRS management was looking for ways of being able to reject those clients who might cost money, and that the changes in the objects of the Act meant there would be no reliable safeguards to protect people with severe disabilities who could not pay for their rehabilitation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Janet Braithwaite, the Executive Director of ACROD, in giving evidence to the Senate Committee, was quite clear that people with severe disabilities were not getting the service from the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service that they used to get. She said in her evidence:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We share the concerns. . . about CRS turning into a business venture concentrating on compensable clients and turning its back on more severely disabled clients. This is not what the mission of the CRS should be.</PARA>
<PARA>Mrs Braithwaite was quite clear that members of her organisation, particularly those dealing with very severely disabled people, were concerned that the CRS was moving towards a more commercial orientation and that this was not the role that the disability community expected or wanted the CRS to fulfil. Indeed, why should the disability community accept that the CRS should become more and more commercially oriented? It is one thing to be efficient&mdash;we have no problems with that. However, it is quite another to become commercial for its own sake, with little concern for the impact on clients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as I am concerned, the CRS does not exist to compete with private rehabilitation services; it exists to provide a service for those people who are not necessarily able to obtain service elsewhere. After all, it is the Commonwealth's rehabilitation service and it has a public responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the Government's desire to change the objects of the DSA reflects a change in attitude about its commitment to people with disabilities. I believe that, to some extent, this attitude is being driven by senior bureaucrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to these very significant changes in the Bill, one could almost be excused for missing them altogether. There was no mention of them in the explanatory memorandum, nor in the Minister's speech. There has certainly been virtually no consultation on these changes&mdash;and that includes not just the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service or its clients but the wider disability community. The implications of these changes have not been spelt out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A senior departmental officer confirmed this lack of consultation to the Senate Committee. In fact, this change has been so low profile that the Government has been, if not secretive about it, certainly not especially interested in talking about the changes until forced to do so. I suggest that, if the Government really was up front and quite happy to face the disability community on these issues, it would at the very least postpone these provisions in the Bill until the Budget session to enable people with disabilities and people within the disability community generally to become aware of it and to comment on it. I also want to place on the record my concerns about the attitude of the management of the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, as it seems that the Opposition is going to support the Government on this legislation tonight, it really is doing a great disservice to people with disabilities. Many disability organisations are still unaware of what is happening. I received a phone call today from someone on another matter. That person was totally unaware that these changes were being proposed and that they would be going through tonight. Once the community becomes aware, it will show its displeasure and anger at what has happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the Opposition supporting the Government, I accept that considerable debate and discussion has occurred. I understand and accept that there has been considerable debate in the Opposition party room. However, I point out to Opposition senators that this is exactly the process that we often use on particular pieces of legislation, such as the superannuation legislation. When is detailed discussion and debate acceptable, and when is detailed discussion and debate called something else? I will not go into that tonight and I certainly will not use any derogatory terms, because I believe that on this occasion there has been a very considered approach by the Opposition. I hope that by us now supporting fully its amendment, which we have been looking at, we will get some redress in this area by making sure that in the guidelines we will still be ensuring a service rather than just possibly assisting somebody to receive a service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that both the Opposition and the Government are sending out the wrong signals to the disability community by introducing significant changes without proper consultation. Neither should be proud of the fact that they are watering down a piece of legislation that many people with disabilities have, until now, seen as an important guarantee of their entitlement to the services that they need. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Health, Housing and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 and particularly on amendments to the Disability Services Act 1986. It is indeed unfortunate that we are faced tonight with debating this matter under the guillotine. The fact is that the Australian Democrats and the Labor Party have seen fit to bring into the Parliament a guillotine which affects such vital legislation as this, and thus many of the issues which have been highlighted by Senator Lees and Senator Patterson, and which will be highlighted by other speakers to follow, have had to take place in such an abbreviated debate and in such a short time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Lees mentioned, this is an issue which has received considerable party room debate by all parties and also has received the attention of a Senate committee in some detail. It is indeed a pity that some of the information that flowed to us after that Senate committee was not made available at the time of the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In turning to the legislation, it would first be useful to run through some of the background to the proposed amendments and to outline the coalition's position on the Act since its implementation in 1987. The Disability Services Act, passed in December 1986 with the support of all parties, replaced the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act 1974. The Act was accompanied by a statement of principles and objectives setting out the right of people with disabilities to individual respect, freedom of choice and fulfilment of their individual potential. A key element was the integration of the disabled into the community through increased independence and greater employment opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was proposed that the Act would be implemented over a five-year period to 30 June 1992, during which time consultations would take place with people concerned with disability services. Then, in 1988, just one year after the Act came into effect, the coalition and the then shadow Minister for community services, Mr Ray Braithwaite, cautioned against too quick a change. He warned that it would take time to adapt. In 1989 Mr Braithwaite spoke about concern and confusion amongst relatives of people with a disability and service providers during the DSA transition period. The implementation of the Act presented considerable difficulties, not least because of the inflexible interpretation of the Act by bureaucrats, their insufficient depth of understanding of the legislation and their lack of skills to implement the requirements in both the government and non-government sectors. Other reasons included the uncertainties of funding during the transition period; fear and confusion among parents as a result of changes to concepts and principles; a lack of sense of community and understanding between governments and the non-government sector; and the almost continuous and massive restructuring of the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services since 1984. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This shake-up has led to considerable tension with the voluntary organisations and a lack of continuity and consistency of departmental decisions. It has also left departmental staff less professional than required. Since 1989 the coalition has attempted to address these problems and improve the Disability Services Act. In November of that year Mr Braithwaite presented to the Parliament a draft Bill proposing amendments to the Disability Services Act. In November 1990 he presented a private  member's Bill proposing similar amendments. In September 1991 he again presented the Bill, proposing the same amendments, but the Government provided no opportunity for fuller debate and acceptance. In April this year he presented the Bill yet again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For almost three years the coalition, on behalf of people with disabilities, parents and service providers, has been pressing the Government to accept the fact that the 1986 Act is not immutable, that change is needed and that a greater degree of certainty and compassion are required in the administration of the Act. It is intolerable that the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) has left carers and people with disabilities so uncertain over the future of their services after June 1992 and what service guidelines will follow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The architect of the Act, the former Senator Don Grimes, said in February of this year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principles and objectives that were set out in the disability services legislation in 1986 are as clear and as sensible as can be found in most places. But I must remind those involved, as I used to at the time, that they are but standards and guidelines to help in the development of programs to assist people to fill their development in society. They are no more than that.</PARA>
<PARA>But the Government, the Minister and the bureaucracy have set their own agenda, creating uncertainty and risking the lifestyles of so many disabled Australians. The coalition has continually urged the Government to amend the Act to provide more flexibility and more certainty to people with disabilities, their families and their service providers. We proposed that the guidelines be formulated and brought before the Parliament for debate, and amended if necessary, so that the criteria for funding of services would be clearly laid down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also proposed that the transition date&mdash;the period in which financial assistance for prescribed services and for upgrading prescribed services is payable&mdash;be extended to give existing services more time to adapt to the requirement of the DSA. Our amendments also provided for security of contracts between the Government and the service provider, and an appeals procedure. We also proposed that the service-type supported employment services be amended to include specifically work crews, small businesses, enclaves, individual supported jobs and sheltered workshops. </PARA>

Until an alternative service is in place, we strongly believe that, if sheltered workshops were not an option, it would be denying many people with disabilities the right to work, the right to training, the right to gain living skills and the right to a choice. They would be sentenced to an existence of boredom and frustration at home, with the consequent stresses on their families and carers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last November the Minister outlined his blueprint for action, saying that he would amend the Disability Services Act. He told the ACROD conference that the transition date of 1992 would be removed but that he would require all types of services&mdash;including sheltered workshops, activity therapy centres and large accommodation services&mdash;to meet certain standards by 1995 in order to continue eligibility for funding. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister also stated that he would formulate and table the section 5 guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major amendments proposed in this Bill recognises that the five-year transition period was not long enough to deal with the complexity of change required. The Bill removes the transition date and provides ongoing funding to prescribed services&mdash;that is, services in existence pre-1987, such as sheltered workshops, accommodation services and activity therapy centres&mdash;provided they meet minimum standards. Parents and disability service providers welcomed this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proposed new section 14A(1) in the Bill provides a safeguard for those who believe that this amendment will take away any inducement on the part of services to progress and offer greater educational and training opportunities to people with disabilities. This section provides that the Minister may terminate funding to a prescribed service, presumably if it is not meeting required standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill removes the restriction on funding for profit organisations. This allows the Minister to fund, on a case by case basis, services that are provided by other than non-profit organisations. Some organisations in the voluntary sector are concerned about this amendment and believe it to be unnecessary. The Minister states that it will assist in the provision of attendant care services. It should be pointed out that under existing legislation there should be no reason why non-profit organisations approved by the Minister should not engage in private for profit attendant care services in meeting service delivery needs in accordance with their contract with the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Voluntary organisations such as the Endeavour Foundation provide immeasurable support to the disabled and their families. The Endeavour Foundation is 76 per cent self-funded; the Government's contribution amounts to 24 per cent. This figure reflects the determination and commitment of the volunteers and representatives of the Foundation who tirelessly coordinate continual fundraising projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill amends the objects of the Disability Services Act to clarify that the disability services program and the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service are assistance programs that operate within budget constraints. For any government there is only so much money available, and there will never be enough to fund all programs to everyone's satisfaction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As much as we would like the disability services program and the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service to be entitlement programs, in reality they are not and they cannot be. The CRS is covered by a separate set of guidelines called administrative procedures. The coalition seeks an assurance that the substantial gains criterion applies also to the CRS, for people with more severe disabilities, and that the proportion of people with severe disabilities receiving a service from the CRS will be maintained. However, we would also request clarification of proposed new subsection 3(2)(b), which states that due regard must be had for `the need to consider equity and merit in accessing those resources'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting to note the consideration by the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs, its report and the dissent in that particular regard. We hope that this applies to the actual services provided and that all people with disabilities requiring a service will receive a service, but that those people with severe and multiple disabilities that may require substantial resources are still able to have access to those resources. I have noted the answers that were provided, with quite detailed statistical information, to the Senate Committee after the various committee hearings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister has stated publicly that he will formulate and table guidelines under section 5 of the Disability Services Act. However, they are not included in this legislation. The coalition believes that these guidelines must not be tabled as disallowable instruments. The coalition is concerned that people with less severe disabilities will be given priority over those with more severe disabilities because of the costs involved. I ask the Minister again to give an assurance, perhaps by way of an inclusion in the guidelines, that new services for people with disabilities will include a significant proportion of people with severe disabilities. The guidelines must be introduced into the Parliament for debate, amended if necessary, and approved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will be moving an amendment to this effect in committee, as well as a number of other amendments proposed in my predecessor's&mdash;that is, the shadow Minister's&mdash;private member's Bill in the House of Representatives. Finally, I would like to acknowledge the contribution made by Ray Braithwaite and his staff in the area of community services and aged care prior to his recent resignation from the shadow ministry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are debating the Health, Housing and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill. I rise to speak briefly on a very basic aspect of health care. My colleagues Senator Patterson and Senator Tambling have certainly covered some of the other areas germane to the Bill, but I wish to speak mainly about the right of Australians to exercise free choice in providing for their own health care. This right is being threatened by the proposal of the honourable member for Canning, Mr Gear, to take away the right to private health insurance and to create a Medicare monopoly. To achieve this he proposes a one per cent rise in the Medicare levy. I suppose that sounds gorgeous, but what Mr Gear does not state is that an extra one per cent on top of the 1 1/4 per cent that we currently pay is actually an increase of 80 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) may state that there are no plans for the nationalisation of private health insurance along the lines that Mr Gear proposes, yet last Friday morning, I think it was, I was listening to Mr Gear on ABC radio and he was quite emphatic when he stated that the Government is seriously looking at his proposals and that he has sympathy for them from both the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and Mr Howe. Of course, Mr Gear is a key supporter of the Prime Minister, and it would be very wrong for us to dismiss the possibility that his objectives would come to pass, because he did say that the Prime Minister and Mr Howe had both PM&amp;C&mdash;for whatever reason I do not know&mdash;and the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services looking at his proposals with great seriousness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, Mr Gear adopts the same divisive style when he speaks of the need for the medical profession to be properly pulled into line. Who is he to say who needs to be properly pulled into line?  The health profession is doing an excellent job under very trying circumstances which are certainly being made no better by the utterances of Mr Gear and others in the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Gear displayed the same stunning lack of logic when, once again, on radio on 27 May he had the temerity to blame private health cover for hospital queues when the continuation of a besieged and eroded private sector was keeping Medicare from collapse and saving some Medicare patients from even longer queues. How absurd it is for the honourable member for Canning to be blaming private hospital insurance for people waiting and dying on the queues. He should ask the State Minister for Health in Western Australia how public hospitals would get along without the 20 per cent funding that comes from private health premiums. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment, the public hospitals are aching to have private patients because they get more money for them and they charge over the top. It is not the fault of the public hospitals. The administrators in the public hospitals are doing their best under extremely trying circumstances. But Mr Gear is simply proposing to make them more trying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Neither is there fairness nor logic in stating that private funds are unpopular because Australians are leaving them. I have never heard anything closer to blaming the victim in my life. It is not surprising that younger and healthier Australians give away private insurance in the midst of a recession when they are given no incentive to maintain their private cover. Many people today are losing their jobs and Mr Gear seems totally and utterly unaware of that. But the reality is that they are losing their jobs, they are struggling to maintain their mortgages, and they are struggling to feed and clothe their families. Of course they will look at ways in which they can cut their family budget and, sadly, private health insurance happens to be one of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, under this Labor Government, a privately insured Australian pays four times for his or her health care: through insurance; through the Medicare levy; through the gap; and also through the general taxation that meets 80 per cent of the totality of Federal Government health spending. It must be remembered that the current levy is paying only about 20 per cent of the total cost of health. So people are having to pay more and more tax in order to cover the cost of health to any degree. Of course, the degree we are seeing today is in the form of queues, queues and more queues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, Mr Gear's solution for shortening the queues is to have people die at the end of them. That is what is happening today. We are seeing it time and time again. We are also seeing families having to take out personal loans to ensure that their loved ones get treatment in a private hospital. If that is the ideal Medicare system for this country, not too many people are enthused about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a real concern that the nationalisation of private health funds and all of the doctor bashing that goes with it will appeal to the Prime Minister, who is absolutely desperate to prove his traditional Labor credentials&mdash;I might add, without thought to the long term social damage that may result from such a move. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can only hope that this Government will pay some attention to the results of a survey undertaken for the Australian Health Insurance Association. Of those surveyed, 48 per cent only were covered by health funds and 45 per cent by Medicare only. Nonetheless, 73 per cent of those surveyed wanted the choice of health fund and only 13 per cent backed the Gear solution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Perth, the percentage in favour of choice was 77 per cent and the percentage of those backing the nationalisation of funds was down to 8 per cent. Of those with incomes below $10,000 per annum, free choice had 73 per cent support. Sixty-five per cent of Labor voters, as well as 82 per cent of Liberal-National voters, supported free choice. These same people strongly backed the principle behind the health policy of Fightback, where tax rebates will be provided for lower income families and the elderly in order to assist with private health insurance payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over 70 per cent of pensioners in this country are taking out private health insurance because they are in fear of getting caught in a queue. They cannot afford it. They get no assistance whatsoever from this Government, yet this Government is running around the countryside lying about the goods and services tax being added to health costs. That is nothing short of a lie. Health costs under Fightback are zero rated. Therefore, all the input costs that people currently have and will have in the future will be fully free of wholesale sales tax because that will be abolished, and the goods and services tax will be fully refunded. When people get a bill from a doctor, they will have the cost of the bill&mdash;whether it is $30 or whatever it is&mdash;plus zero GST, so the total cost of the health bill will remain at $30. It is an absolute lie to say that a goods and services tax will make health care more expensive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These same people to whom I referred earlier strongly backed the Fightback proposals. Eighty-two per cent of those questioned, including 79 per cent of Labor voters, believe in the principle of the rebate, and nearly 90 per cent consider that this would be a positive incentive for self-provision. These straws in the wind show clearly that the Australian people want to have the choice and opportunity for self-provision, just as 40 per cent of those Australians who have struggled to keep their private insurance have annual incomes under $31,000. These are the very people most of whom this Government does not give any tax benefit to, and does not give any encouragement to, to take out private health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One may just as well ask, I suppose: where is the true conscience of Labor when, in the name of a sterile and unworkable ideology, it is prepared to tolerate and reward the 20 per cent of Australians who earn more than $52,000 each year but are prepared to rely solely on Medicare? It is those higher income earners who choose not to be in the private health insurance system that the Liberal and National parties will ensure pay their contribution because they, if they choose not to take out private health insurance, will be confronted with a tax surcharge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must add that, contrary to the Labor lies, those who are on pensions and welfare will not be forced out of Medicare because Medicare will be retained. As George Bush said a few years ago, `Read my lips'. Medicare will be retained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nationalisation of health funds will not make for better health care but will deprive yet more Australians of the health care they need. It is socialism run mad and there is absolutely no guarantee that it will not become a reality. It is about time the people of Australia expressed to this Government that they are sick and tired&mdash;no pun intended&mdash;of being pushed to the end of queues and not being able to get health services of a high quality when they need them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Health, Housing and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill, which we are debating tonight, covers a number of areas. It has amendments to the Disability Services Act, the First Home Owners Act, the Health Insurance Act, the Hearing Services Act, the National Health Act and the Therapeutic Goods Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Opposition has been forced by the guillotine into curtailing the debate on and consideration of this very large and most important piece of legislation, I am forced by the vote of the Government and the Democrats to curtail my speech to just a few moments so I will only be able to express my concerns in two areas. Those areas are, firstly, the amendments to the Health Insurance Act and, secondly, that part of the Disability Services Act which increases the length of time for accommodation services, sheltered workshops, activity centres and other similar services to continue to be eligible for funding during the transition period while their services fall into line with the requirements set down by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes to the Disability Services Act have taken much longer to come about than the Government expected. It was always pie in the sky stuff that such an extraordinarily enormous change could occur in such a short time as five years. Many of the services for the disabled had been available for many years. It was not only the service providers concerned with their clients' welfare who found the changes disturbing and threatening but also the disabled themselves who feared leaving the protection of either their accommodation or workplace. We have yet to be sure that these changes will be for the better, as so many services have not yet progressed very far. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The five years has now been expanded and the Government has been forced to make available ongoing funding for those services which are moving towards change. Minimum standards, which are a far cry from section 10, were introduced in February 1991. It is those services that meet these standards with a promise for ongoing changes which will receive funding under the new transitional funding services. The Bill assures us that that transitional stage for review will continue perhaps every five years. This will enable these transitional services to slowly but surely move until eventually they go into section 10. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have always complained that when this Government in particular brings in its legislation it does not provide guidelines to the Senate. This is once again the case. As we are all well aware, the guidelines are usually brought in as regulations. Regulations cannot be amended; they can only be accepted or rejected in toto. On this occasion, the Opposition believes that the guidelines should be included in the Bill so that they can be scrutinised, debated and amended, if necessary, in the Senate. We will be moving our amendment in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now move to the repealing of the Government's co-payment legislation in the health insurance area. This is another amendment in this particularly large Bill. As we are all well aware, the need for this change has more to do with the change of Prime Minister than with the equity or the health of the people in Australia. Indeed, it has nothing to do with equity; it has nothing to do with the taxpayers' money being abused; and it has nothing to do with the health of the community. It has to do only with the change of Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the Budget last year, we were informed that because Medicare was going broke there would be a need for a co-payment of $3.50. At the time, Mr Howe put forward a very reasonable argument: the patient should pay an up-front $3.50 for every medical service untaken by a general practitioner. It was to start on 1 November 1991. That amount was to be increased by $1.50 to a co-payment of $5 from November 1992. The estimated savings from the Budget&mdash;and this is in Budget Paper No. 1&mdash;were $163.9m for the year 1991-92 and $306.1m for the year 1992-93. That was quite a saving. When that was announced in the Budget, all hell broke loose in the left wing of the Labor Party. That resulted in the $3.50 charge being reduced to $2.50. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is how the Labor Party works. It was nothing to do with the health of the nation; nothing to do with taxpayers saving their money; and nothing to do with the proper expenditure of the health dollar&mdash;where it should be spent and where the priorities should be. It was purely and simply to do with the votes to change from one Prime Minister to another. We all remember that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) succeeded. As soon as he succeeded, Senator Crowley publicly said that she was going to extract her price. As I say, this is how legislation is dealt with Labor Party style. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The change made a big difference to the Budget. Instead of a saving of $306.1m for 1992-93, the Australian community got a saving of only $33.1m for the three-month period that that co-payment was functioning. However, the original cost of advertising and informing doctors and the community at large of the $3.50 charge, then of the change in that charge to $2.50, and of the next change to no co-payment at all following the change in prime ministership, has been costed at $8.325m. That is nearly $8.4m thoroughly wasted on advertising that should never have needed to take place. In other words, the cost to the taxpayer of the change of Prime Minister was $281m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the three-month period when the $2.50 co-payment was in force, there was a saving through reduced services of $1.7m. We just have to remember that that $2.50 was a co-payment only when bulkbilling took place. We do know that at least $1.7m was saved in reduced services&mdash;obviously unnecessary services&mdash;because patients were not to be bulkbilled, would have had to pay $2.50 and did not see the necessity to go to the doctor to be quite as urgent as would otherwise have been the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, in 1992-93 there could have been a saving of $281m of taxpayers' money. If the Government did not want to give back that money to the people, it could have spent it on the present hospital crisis. We must not forget what is occurring in the hospitals around the States. In a recent newspaper article, Mr Keith Wilson, the Western Australian Minister for Health, said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak but on two matters; the first being the Disability Services Act 1986. On 6 November last year I spoke on this Act and its failure to implement proposals within the five-year timeframe ending 1 July this year. I commend the Act in this regard but report that there has been little progress in the nine months since I last spoke. The one point that I want to emphasise to the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services, if not to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe), is that there is an urgent need to involve the parents and carers in the implementation process or at least listen to their concerns.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that some action has been taken in this regard but their concerns may not be those of organisations such as the Endeavour Foundation. When the Act was introduced into the other place I was appalled to read an extraordinary attack on the Endeavour Foundation by the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford), when she trivialised the whole debate and talked about gold taps in the Endeavour Foundation's headquarters. Subsequently, she has had to backtrack because they were brass taps. She obviously showed her ignorance of the appearance of the two; she probably cannot tell the difference. Her attack on the Endeavour Foundation is no way to get compliance of the people that are delivering services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect that I wish to refer to is the co-payment issue. As my colleague Senator Walters said, it had nothing to do with the delivery of health care. The co-payment was rescinded because the Minister had trodden on the ideological nerve endings of the troglodyte Left and Centre Left of the Australian Labor Party. It was all about power, the position of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and had nothing to do with health care delivery. If those opposite do not believe me, I quote from the second reading speech on the Health Insurance Amendment Bill 1991 made by the Minister, Mr Howe, in the other place on 20 August 1991:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major problem facing Australia's health care system is the growth in use of medical services per person. This growth means that every 20 years the number of medical services per person doubles. That growth is not caused by Medicare. The national health strategy has shown growth has been occurring fairly constantly since at least 1976. The cause is an open-ended fee for service system underwritten by insurance&mdash;whether public or private. The result has been that, as doctors' numbers have grown, so too has the use of medical services.</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cause is an open-ended fee for service system underwritten by insurance&mdash;whether public or private.</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister said that Medicare was not the problem. That was the Minister's argument last year. With this reversal it must be evident, even to the Minister, that Medicare has failed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The starting point to confront the reality of where we are, and then to show how to get where we want to be, is to recognise what the problems are. The reality is that we have an unstable health care delivery system. The Minister would recognise that. The fact that he set up the Macklin inquiry should be enough evidence for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a hopelessly overworked and inefficient public hospital system starved of funds. One can quote the State health Ministers on that; even a Labor health Minister from Western Australia. We have a grossly underutilised private hospital system. We have the demoralised general practitioners, with massive oversupply and lowering standards. We have entrepreneurial exploitation of the Medicare system. I quote the Department. We have a rapidly declining level of private health insurance which is now 41 per cent in Australia. Incidentally, the level is 31 per cent in Queensland, my own State, where we have had a public health system for over 40 years. That is the bottom line. That is where we are going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Medicare is in crisis. The Australian Hospitals Association, representing the over 600 public hospitals&mdash;public hospitals; no axe to grind&mdash;has joined with the Private Hospitals Association in Operation Hospital Survival. We all know there will be a $10 billion Budget deficit federally. All the State Budgets are in trouble. Where will the money come from to fix the public hospital system? Hospital costs are increasing at about 12 per cent per year. Capital expenditure for the public hospitals of Australia is decreasing: it is about 3 per cent, when we need at least 7 per cent just to replace what we have at the moment. The basic problem is Medicare itself. The Medicare levy brings in only 18 per cent of total health expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to see Minister Tate here. He keeps bringing up this comparison with the USA. I commend to him a book called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Health Insurance in Practice</EMPHASIS> by William A. Glaser. It details the various health systems in the world. I commend it to the Department, too. I know that nobody has taken it out from the Library, though admittedly it was published only this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difference between the Australian health system and the American health system is that there is no system in the US. One-third of the financing comes from employers as part of the employment agreement. One-third comes out of private funds. That leaves another third of the cost uninsured. There is an element of Medicare. American Medicare covers all retired persons. Medicaid is public welfare provided through an agreement with the respective states to cover the costs of chronically disabled and socially handicapped people. There is private insurance for individuals from non-profit and for-profit insurance companies. Then there are the unemployed, who are not covered because of their varying employment situations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What there is of a non-integrated system in America has failed because employer provided health insurance automatically goes when the employee shifts his place of employment. Dependants lose automatic coverage in groups run at employer expense. To compare what occurs in America and then say, as Minister Tate did the other day, that the Opposition is trying to sell the American system to Australia is absurd. It shows a total lack of knowledge of the American health care system by Minister Tate and Minister Howe as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no good talking about solutions unless we know where we want to go. Peter Ellyard, from the Commission for the Future, at the Syme Oration at the general scientific meeting of the College of Surgeons a couple of weeks ago in Canberra, said that Australia always approaches problems when what we should be doing is deciding what our vision should be&mdash;what do we want out of something&mdash;and then attaining it. He gave the instance of Korea, where 10 years ago 50 per cent of children did not get to grade 12. It decided that within 10 years it would get the majority into grade 12 level education.

According to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Oxford English Dictionary</EMPHASIS>, `vision' is statesman-like foresight. We need statesman-like foresight from this Government. Better still, we as an opposition are providing it. The vision is that we should have a health system which enables people to choose their own doctor, their own hospital and their own health fund. To do this, we need flexibility between Commonwealth, State and private funding to accommodate change. Change will occur. It is the only constant. Change will occur no matter what we do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Fightback health policy will accommodate change by maintaining community rating, by providing tax credits and tax penalties to encourage private hospital insurance, by preserving a government schedule of medical fees but allowing private medical insurance to cover the gap between refund and fees, and by introducing co-payment as a brake to overusage and overservicing, just as the Minister said in November last year. We agreed. Introducing co-payment will provide a brake to overusage and overservicing. The Fightback health policy will also reform the public hospital system by privatising support services. Of course, this will be done in an environment where a whole range of major taxes will be abolished&mdash;payroll tax, petrol tax, sales tax, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All health related services will be quarantined from the one-off price effect of the goods and services tax. With no GST on health spending and lower infrastructure costs, health costs should actually fall. Added to this will be competition, encouraged by ending the Government monopoly on medical insurance and allowing private health funds and other insurers flexibility in other private health cover, subject to appropriate prudential requirements and basic standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, under Fightback health policy we can expect a challenge to the Australian people to accept responsibility for their own health care while demanding better access and better quality of delivery but keeping a safety net for the disadvantaged. It is a prescription for the future which should be acceptable to all Australians. </PARA>

The fact is that what we have on the part of the Opposition is the development of a scheme which will allow doctors to charge up to the AMA fee without the possibility of bulkbilling which, of course, would be a restraint on that sort of charging practice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Fightback proposal the tax system would be used quite markedly in order to transfer funds from ordinary taxpayers through to the private insurance funds. I will tell the Senate how that will work. By the offering of subsidies, tax credits and so on, the Opposition would effectively be using the tax system to subsidise private health insurance. That is the Opposition's scheme. How would the Opposition pay for it out of the tax system? Of course, the Opposition would cut the payments to the States by 5 per cent which would mean that they would be less able to fund public hospitals. In fact, the Opposition would simply be taking tax funds away from the public hospitals and putting them into the private health insurance funds; taxpayers' funds would be directed into private health insurance funds rather than into the public hospital scheme. That is exactly what would happen under the Opposition's scheme. That point needs to be made. There is no golden pot of money somewhere; it would all come from the taxpayers. The Opposition would subsidise private health insurance; we prefer to see the money going via the States into the public hospital system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In so far as the provision of health care for Australians is concerned, there is no doubt that we have to look at the question of hospital funding. That has to be tackled and is being tackled. That is being looked at by taking account of the obvious fact that much of the need for future hospital services will be brought about as a result of the ageing of the population. That means that there has to be a closer link between acute care and community care, particularly care for the aged within our community; we need to integrate acute care, post-acute care, community care and care for the aged. That is the way in which we need to develop strategies in order to relieve pressure in the hospital system. The next Medicare agreement will not simply be a hospitals agreement&mdash;that would be far too narrow; the next Medicare agreement will provide the framework for relations between governments across the full spectrum of health and aged care strategies. That is a very practical and sensible approach and I am sure honourable senators opposite would agree. </PARA>

There is no need for a doctor to charge anything, nor is there a need for a doctor not to charge what he considers would be a bulkbilling fee if he so chooses. We would not prohibit bulkbilling as Senator Tate has indicated, in so far as a doctor could, if he so chose, charge the fee that those opposite would consider to be a bulkbilling charge.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bills are very different in various respects. The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill deals with a range of matters. Essentially it deals with the extension of the motor vehicle export facilitation scheme to manufactures of vehicle components; it deals with the duty free importation of components for the manufacture and repair of wheelchairs; it deals with developing country tariff preferences being extended to the former Yugoslav republics; it amends the definition of off-road vehicles and it clarifies high clearances for these; it removes duty paid on New Zealand tobacco products in line with the CER; it allows certain technologically more advanced, more efficient or more productive capital equipment which is not available from Australian manufacturers to be imported free of duty. There are other changes concerning steel products as specifically induced materials, duty rates for TCF, new tariff structures for bicycles and minor administrative changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not comment on those in any detail. I simply say that, in relation to the requests that the Government has, I understand, circulated in the chamber to amend schedule 1 of the Customs Tariff Act to take account of `changes in the status of countries and places which qualify for preferential treatment', I should say that the Opposition continues to support the schedule 5 request with regard to the name of Macedonia which the Government has decided to incorporate in its amendments to the Customs Tariff Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow Minister for industry and commerce, Mr McLachlan, moved a similar amendment in the other place on 27 May. The Liberal-National coalition believes that the descriptive name of `former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia' is presently an appropriate name to refer to the former republic in that it does not prejudice present and possibly future negotiations on the name that will eventually be agreed for the former republic. I will not go into any more detail on that aspect either other than to welcome the Government's agreement with the proposition that we put in the other place and the concern that we expressed in the other place about the particular wording in respect of that at the moment very sensitive issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that regard, I noticed today&mdash;and on behalf of the coalition I note with pleasure&mdash;that there appears to have been some forward movement on the question of the naming of the former Yugoslav republic in the last 24 hours or so. Some compromise appears to have been reached&mdash;or is in the process of being reached&mdash;between the European community, Greece and the former republic. The coalition certainly hopes that that will lead to a satisfactory solution to what has been a very tricky problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main issue, though, in relation to the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill is, of course, the introduction of a $12,000 tariff on imported used cars on top of the 35 per cent tariff rate. The coalition has been extremely concerned about this proposition right from the outset. I will explain briefly the reasons for that, and other colleagues of mine will be doing the same in this debate. I will move an amendment in committee in respect of this matter. Indeed, I now also move on behalf of the Opposition a second reading amendment, namely:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At end of motion, add, "but the Senate requests the Government to refer to the Industry Commission for urgent inquiry and report its proposal to impose a punitive $12,000 duty on the importation of second hand vehicles into Australia".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a very important item and a very important issue. It has considerable relevance to the motor vehicle industry as a whole in Australia. It was for that reason that the matter was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology for inquiry and report. Indeed, that Committee reported today with a divided report. A very significant minority report has been submitted by my colleagues Senator Archer and Senator Ferguson. No doubt Senator Archer will refer to that minority report in his own remarks during this debate, and I will not traverse those remarks other than to say in summary that we are extremely concerned that the Government should take such a fundamentally important decision&mdash;namely, the imposition of a totally punitive tariff on used vehicles, a tariff of $12,000&mdash;without any proper inquiry, report and investigation into the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that the matter should have been the subject of urgent inquiry and report before any proposal of this nature was made. That is the basis of the second reading amendment that I have moved. That Industry Commission inquiry should look at a range of issues since we are dealing with an unusual situation. The whole issue arises because of the particular registration requirements that apply to used motor vehicles in Japan where in effect motor vehicles are unable to stay on the roads after something like five years due to the punitive registration and other arrangements applying there. As a result, there is a very large backlog, a very large pool, of used vehicles to find homes for around the world if they can be found. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that that is a matter requiring investigation and report so far as the possible importation of them into Australia is concerned. We believe that the Industry Commission should be asked to assess matters such as whether car registration arrangements in Japan, to which I have just referred, accelerate depreciation of older vehicles, thus depressing their resale value, and the extent to which this may constitute an effective subsidy to Japanese car producers. The inquiry should investigate the potential impact of second-hand imports on the automotive industry in Australia. It should assess the potential impact on car prices, the impact on Australian consumers, and whether imported used cars under current arrangements would meet all design, safety and consumer requirements imposed on local producers and dealers. We are not on our own on this. It is strongly supported by the Australian Automobile Association, which represents more than five million motorists. No evidence has been brought forward to this Senate to indicate that there has been any proper investigation into this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Government is not prepared to have the matter referred to the Industry Commission for inquiry and report, then on behalf of the Opposition I shall be moving in committee that the $12,000 tariff be removed. In the event that that is not carried&mdash;and I understand it will not be carried because the Democrats have indicated that they will not be supporting that amendment&mdash;then on behalf of the coalition I give the assurance that when we win government, whenever that may be in the next few months, we will as a matter of immediacy refer the whole issue to the Industry Commission for urgent inquiry and report. I will not pursue that matter any further at this stage as I know that some of my colleagues wish to speak on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will turn briefly to the other two Bills&mdash;namely, the Customs Legislation (Tariff Concessions and Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill 1992 and the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill 1992. These Bills implement changes broadly in line with Industry Commission recommendations on tariff concessions and they introduce anti-dumping and countervailing measures announced by the Government on 5 December last. Whilst those changes are welcome and are generally an improvement on the current position, they do not go anywhere near meeting the demands of industry; nor do they go anywhere near meeting or matching the coalition's policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main Bill&mdash;namely, the Customs Legislation (Tariff Concessions and Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill includes a number of definitional changes, including replacing the goods serving similar function test with a more appropriate substitutability one and revised procedures and time limits. In contrast, the coalition's policy announced last December&mdash;which was a confirmation of an earlier announced policy, but firmed up some of the additional details&mdash;would go much further than that. We would reduce significantly the inquiry period required in anti-dumping applications. We would reduce the prima facie case hearing to five days and we would reduce the preliminary investigation to 60 days, with provision for an up to 30-day extension in special circumstances. We would also take other measures which would result in a maximum period of 155 days, or 185 days in exceptional cases, rather than the present 225 days for the investigation as a whole to be undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would also make the Australian Customs Service responsible for determining whether or not dumping is occurring, while the Australian Anti-Dumping Authority would be responsible for determining material injury. We would also extend the three-year sunset clause to five years. That is something which I note the Government has adopted belatedly. We welcome the fact that it has done so, despite its belatedness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would also allow for the exchange of confidential information between the parties in order to speed up the process. We would ensure that material injury tests would not require virtual decimation before action was available. We would also ensure that adequate resources are available to the ACS and the ABA to make the system operate as intended. In other words, we would make the anti-dumping provisions quicker, fairer and cheaper. That would of course provide long and short term benefits to industry and, importantly, to consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, we will not be opposing the Bills, but we will be moving amendments, which I will move in the course of my remarks. The main amendment that we will move will reduce the prima facie hearing stage from the Government's proposal of 25 days in this Bill&mdash;which is a reduction on the pre-existing arrangement of 35 days&mdash;to five days. We do not believe there is any necessity at all for the delay to be as long as 25 days. There have been complaints progressively over the years as the number of days for these hearings has been reduced and there has been the frequent claim that all concerned would not be able to meet these new timetables. In all cases they have been met without great difficulty in the long run, and we see no reason why that will not be the case this time as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that respect, the Opposition has a second reading amendment to add to the end of the motion for the second reading on the Customs Legislation (Tariff Concessions and Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill 1992. I move:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the motion add `, but the Senate is of the opinion that, in addition to the amendments to the anti-dumping and countervailing procedures contained in the Bill, the Government should move immediately to make the current inadequate procedures faster and more effective:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) by reducing the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">prima facie</EMPHASIS> hearing stage to 5 working days;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) by reducing the preliminary inquiry stage to 60 days, thus enabling the imposition of provisional measures after 65 days instead of the current 125 days; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) by facilitating much speedier hearings by running parallel inquiries by the Anti-Dumping Authority and the Australian Customs Service into the extent of injury and extent of dumping or subsidisation respectively;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">thus ensuring that Australian industries are not immeasurably disadvantaged by unfair trading practices before remedial action is taken'.</PARA>
<PARA>In addition to that second reading amendment, I foreshadow that I will be moving amendments in the committee stage, in particular to substitute the five days for the 25 days. We will come to the details of that in the committee stage. I understand that the Democrats have in mind a similar amendment to that which we are proposing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point of amendment that I will now deal with briefly relates to the compliance required in respect of applications for hearings. As part of the trade-off, I guess, for shortening the time to establish a prima facie case to 25 days, the Government is amending the legislation to require that dumping or countervailing applications must `strictly' comply with the approved form. Indeed, in the second reading speech the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To keep processing time for anti-dumping relief to a minimum, the Government also considers it appropriate that the applicant for that relief provide sufficient information to enable a prima facie case to be established. The technical requirements of applications have therefore been tightened by clauses 12 and 13 of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA>I must say that we are concerned about the proposition in the Bill to insert the word `strictly'. There is no definition contained anywhere, as far as I am aware, of just what `strictly' means. I understand that there have been problems with the use of the word in tax legislation from time to time because of the lack of definition. The point I make on behalf of the coalition is that it does appear to place a significant additional burden on the Australian producer and it provides at least technically, and I think more than technically, a convenient legal out for the importer on the grounds that the application has not been strictly complied with, whatever that means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some representations have been made to the coalition, and I understand also to the Democrats and the Government, on this matter. For example, we have had representations from imported food processors, or the raw material producers. The particular example I am thinking of involves pig producers, which is an interesting one to be bringing up at this time with the piggery debate that has been going on. There is a section in the form in which processors have to detail the effect on their business of the import. This means, in the case of imported processed food, that processors have to be joined in the action as they are the producers of like goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are concerned about this amendment because if one takes the word `comply' on its own strict meaning, then presumably people either comply with the requirements or they do not. There is no half-way house. The Act, as drafted before this latest amending Bill, just talks about `comply'. We do not understand the reason for inserting the word `strictly'. We certainly accept the proposition that if the number of days for the processing of applications for dumping and countervailing is to be reduced, that material has to be provided to the authorities in the shortest possible time. We do not see that the word `strictly' adds anything to that. In the absence of an adequate explanation as to how the word `strictly' really does change it, and given the concerns that we have about the interpretations that can be put on the word, I foreshadow that I will be moving an amendment at the committee stage&mdash;and I think the Democrats have a similar amendment&mdash;to omit the word `strictly' from the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those are the main points I make in relation to those Bills. I will not go into them at any greater length because I know that there is a long speakers list; we once again have the guillotine applied and we have only two hours to discuss these very important issues. It is an enormous indictment yet again of the Government for its mismanagement in terms of handling the business of the Senate and the disdain with which it treats the proper parliamentary process. I have covered the main points I wished to cover. I hope that we will deal with more of them, if time will permit, at the committee stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak on the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1992, first of all, in my capacity as Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1992 was referred to the Committee by the Senate on 2 June 1992 for examination of that part of the Bill that sought to impose a $12,000 tariff on the importation of used cars in large volume.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The background to the proposal to introduce this tariff is that in 1987-88 large numbers of used cars were being imported from Japan. At the time, the Government sought to restrict such importation by introducing the Motor Vehicle Standards Act 1989, which stipulated that all imported vehicles had to meet Australian design rules. It was expected that by enforcing compliance with Australian design rules it would become uneconomic for importers to seek to import used cars. At the time, that expectation was met and the numbers of such used vehicle imports declined dramatically. I should point out that it is still possible to import used vehicles for personal use or in low volume, that is, less than 100 vehicles per year per importer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last three or four years the automotive industry has been subject to an inquiry by the Industry Commission which reported in December 1990. Based in part on that report, the Government in its March 1991 industry statement announced new arrangements for the car industry essentially reducing levels of assistance. It is significant that, in the Commission's inquiry and in the Government's consideration of the Commission's report, the importation of used vehicles in large volumes was not anticipated, as it had been felt that the requirements of the Motor Vehicle Standards Act had eliminated that possibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, over the last two or three years Taiyo Corporation Pty Ltd has been seeking to import used motor vehicles in large volumes from Japan and was attempting to do so by meeting all requirements of the Motor Vehicle Standards Act and the Australian design rules. Taiyo is almost at the point where compliance could be obtained from the Department of Transport and Communications for the importation of the Mazda 626. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology was concerned about a number of issues raised during the inquiry. However, one point remains fundamental to our consideration of this matter: the Committee agreed that it is necessary for the Government to develop plans, such as the car plan announced as part of the industry statement, and that industry and the community should be able to rely on actions designed to achieve that plan. To the extent that the Government moved to introduce a $12,000 tariff to allow the smooth working of the car plan, the Committee supported the measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This fundamental issue became blurred because, when the Government moved in 1989 to restrict imports of used motor vehicles in large volumes through the use of the Australian design rules, it does not appear to the Committee that the motor industry was told of the Government's real intention in direct enough terms. The Government's real intention was to eliminate the importation of used cars in large volumes. This point became significant because companies such as Taiyo, which were observing the letter of the law, attempted to seek compliance for particular used motor vehicle imports and may well have been misled by the Government's approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Had tariff protection been adopted in 1989, there may have been less confusion over the importation of used vehicles than is currently the case in the car industry. By majority vote, the Committee recommended that the legislation should be passed in its proposed form. However, I point out that several members have expressed reservations about the recommendation contained in the report. I do not wish to canvass those reservations. No doubt they will deal with this in the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To some extent the reservations of committee members centre on confusion expressed by various sectors of the motor industry as to the reasons for the Government imposing this tariff. These include safety issues and concern for protection of consumers. Indeed, the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce canvassed such issues in detail in its response to the Committee. In so doing, it reinforced the confusion of the parties to the debate which attempted to explain, or defend or attack the logic of these issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) made it clear in his evidence to the Committee&mdash;I want to emphasise this&mdash;that the importation of used cars in large volumes would, in his opinion, adversely impact on the car plan as agreed between the Government and the industry. For that reason, action had to be taken. The Committee's majority recommendation to support the legislation was based on that decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make my own support for the legislation abundantly clear. We are talking about an industry with 52,000 people, plus 20,000 people in the supporting industries. We are talking about a $2.5 billion investment between 1992 and 1995. That is a significant part of our manufacturing industry. We also are talking about an export industry worth $1.12 billion in 1990-91. This is probably the premier section of Australian manufacturing industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the Opposition has foreshadowed an amendment to be moved at the committee stage which will frighten people in the industry: first of all, those people I have mentioned who are employees of the industry; and secondly, those in the boardrooms. We know that this is one of the industries in which there is overseas control or ownership. We are giving the wrong message to the owners of the car manufacturing companies. We are indicating a lack of faith in an industry which is, in good faith, restructuring its arrangements, management and techniques. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry is facing a consistent reduction&mdash;probably faster than most other motor companies in the world&mdash;in the protection that it has enjoyed over many years. For that reason, the amendment proposed by the Opposition will tell everybody in Australia&mdash;every motor worker, every person who gains from the motor vehicle building industry&mdash;at least one thing: at the next election there will be a clear choice between this Government, which believes in fostering a modernised vehicle building industry, and the Opposition, which is prepared to play around to score a point by threatening to take away the $12,000 proposal, thus threatening the nature of the motor vehicle building industry as we know it today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the Opposition's folly in doing this, because I believe that all those people who directly and indirectly benefit from the vehicle building industry will support this Government and the continuation of the car plan, or the Button plan as it has been named, to credit the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce who has done so much to encourage the modernisation of this industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to address the three customs tariffs amendment Bills which are being debated cognately by the Senate tonight&mdash;the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1992, the Customs Legislation (Tariff Concessions and Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill 1992 and the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill 1992. I firstly turn to the Customs Tariffs Amendment Bill 1992. This Bill contains a number of measures including provisions to allow motor vehicle component manufacturers to directly use import credits; to allow state-of-the-art capital equipment which is more efficient and more productive than equipment available from Australian manufacturers to be imported duty free; and to allow certain materials to be imported duty free for specific end uses in order to assist the competitiveness of certain Australian industries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other provisions, and the Australian Democrats support them. But I wish to specifically address two issues that are presented in this Bill. The first is the insertion of new tender quotas and tender extension rates for the TCF industries. I cannot help wondering at a government that proceeds on this path of destruction for the TCF industries&mdash;one of the largest employers in our country and, so far, a very active part of our manufacturing industries&mdash;in the same week in which the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) intends to bring down a statement to assist TCF industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 20 June, Tim Colebatch wrote an article headed `Victoria loses 16% of jobs in manufacturing', which quotes the comments of Mr John Paterson, the director of the Australian Chamber of Manufactures, on the number of jobs lost. We now have only 963,900 people working in factories compared with 1,096,800 only two years earlier. To turn specifically to TCF industries, in that time span we have lost 473 clothing factories. I find it absolutely incomprehensible that the Government will continue to proceed along this path of destroying our manufacturing industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to advert to the question that I asked Senator Button at Question Time today in order to emphasise that, when we suggest there should be a pause in tariff cuts, we are not suggesting that we should return to across-the-board high protection levels. We are well aware that in past years they have produced lazy management, featherbedded labour and high costs to consumers. What we are suggesting is that we should have a deliberate, planned and strategically assessed industry policy and that we should use a pause in tariff cuts so that we have some industry left on which we can use some strategic thinking. But that does not seem to be included in the Government's thinking or, for that matter, in the Opposition's thinking, because it wants to proceed to zero tariffs within a number of years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue is the proposed imposition of a $12,000 tariff on second-hand cars. This issue arose because under a plan put forward by the Taiyo Corporation we can now expect to go well beyond the current system which allows 100 units of any one model to be imported by an importer in any one year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1989 a number of companies in Western Australia had begun importing second-hand cars from Japan. These imports stopped when the Motor Vehicle Standards Act required the cars to be modified to meet the safety requirements of the Australian design rules applicable at the time when the cars were manufactured. By April 1989, before the Act came into effect, some 2,000 second-hand Japanese cars a month were coming into Western Australia. In the March 1989 quarter, this represented some 16 per cent of total first registrations. The second-hand car imports are threatening to take off again because one company, Taiyo Corporation, has successfully worked through the process required to get approval under the design rules. Clearly, other companies will follow if the $12,000 tariff is not introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats will be supporting this Government measure. We simply are not prepared to jeopardise local jobs and the currently fairly finely balanced industry plan by introducing yet another competitor from abroad. The second-hand cars are becoming available at low prices because Japanese authorities make re-registration prohibitive&mdash;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0X4">Senator SPINDLER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The car industry plan is based on current levels of imports. The Australian car industry is struggling strenuously and somewhat valiantly, perhaps to the Opposition's regret, to become more competitive but at the same time to preserve jobs and to produce cars in Australia rather than to import second-hand cars which have been made redundant in Japan and for which the Opposition wants to make Australia a dumping place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If these cars were allowed to come onto the market here, the small, medium and upper medium segments of Australian based producers would suffer most. Some 30,000 units would be at risk in the small segment, including brand names such as Laser, Corolla and Nova; some 30,000 in the medium range, including Camry, Apollo and Magna; and up to 25,000 in the upper medium segment, including Commodore, Lexcen, Falcon and Verada. It is clear that such losses in market share would affect the viability of production runs and endanger current jobs, future investment and long term employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some other minor points were raised. I say `minor' because I believe they pale into insignificance against the major argument which juxtaposes the admitted consumer benefits of having yet another source of cars on the market and the task of preserving jobs in the Australian car manufacturing and car parts manufacturing industries. The argument was raised that spare parts would be hard to get. I believe that was answered satisfactorily by Taiyo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Environmental factors were raised that these cars are probably cleaner in environmental terms than some of the second-hand cars which are now on our roads. Of course, that would not be true if they replaced new cars. The influx of the numbers that are forecast clearly would affect new cars&mdash;admittedly, both imported&mdash;and, perhaps to a larger extent, cars that are manufactured or assembled in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is argued by some senators here and by Taiyo that it is spending approximately $2,000 per car more than an importer does. That is true. It is also substantially less than the locally made car. That is what the Australian Democrats are concerned about. We believe, on balance, that the jobs in the factories of Australian car makers and component manufacturers far outweigh the benefits to the consumer and the other concerns that were put forward. The Government's offer to compensate Taiyo Corporation for the initial outlay is a justified offer. I believe that Taiyo Corporation has been led to believe that it would be able to proceed with its plan. I believe that Taiyo is entitled to government compensation. The Australian Democrats will watch carefully the adequacy of that particular compensation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the Customs Legislation (Tariff Concessions and Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill 1992. This Bill makes concessional entry more readily available for certain products without affecting the assistance given to industry. The Government claims it will improve the openness, clarity and consistency of the tariff concession system. The Australian Democrats see no problem with this section of the Bill and, therefore, will not be opposing the relevant clauses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other main area is the changes to current anti-dumping and countervailing arrangements so that Australian producers are better protected with adequate remedies to unfair trading practices. In particular, there is a reduction of the prima facie hearing stage from 35 to 25 working days and an extension of time from three to five years during which anti-dumping measures and undertakings are to remain in force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats are concerned that the proposed changes to current anti-dumping and countervailing arrangements do not go far enough to protect Australian manufacturers from overseas dumping. Consequently, I foreshadow a series of Democrat amendments which aim to level the playing field for Australian manufacturers. I will return to this issue later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, tariff concession orders are made in respect of goods serving similar functions to those produced or capable of being produced by Australian industry in the normal course of business. The objective of the system is to ensure that industry is not taxed by a tariff which serves no protective function. This has the practical effect of lowering input costs so as to improve the international competitiveness of Australian industry. However, since the introduction of the present provisions in this area, there has been growing dissatisfaction with the operation of the system, particularly with the time taken to obtain a concession order and the lack of transparency in the decision making process leading to the grant or refusal of such an order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendments in this Bill aim to make concessional entry more readily available, without affecting the assistance given to industry, and to improve the openness, clarity and consistency of the tariff concession system. As already stated, the Australian Democrats have no real concerns with this area and will not oppose its passage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the amendments that the Australian Democrats will move during the committee stage. Amendments Nos 1 and 4 reduce the prima facie hearing stage from 25 days, as proposed in the Government's amendments, to five days, which is similar to the amendment that the Opposition intends to move. The rationale for this amendment is simply to ensure that Australian industries are assisted with a much faster anti-dumping process so that remedial action can be taken more quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we are following that with a number of amendments which are designed to ensure that these five days are capable of being achieved. Amendments Nos 2 and 5 will delete the proposed heavier burden of proof which the Government is seeking to place on the applicant manufacturer, by inserting the word `strictly' before `complies'. Our amendment will make it easier for Australian manufacturers or producers to obtain anti-dumping relief. I am glad to hear that the Opposition is planning to introduce a similar amendment. These two amendments are, therefore, assured of passage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments Nos 3 and 6 are designed to weaken the burden of proof on the applicant when the comptroller considers an application, so that the comptroller will still be able to make an initial decision within the proposed five days. We believe that this is still in accordance with GATT principles, particularly Article 5(1) of the anti-dumping code. I am somewhat disappointed that the Opposition is not disposed to support us in that. I believe that if we wish&mdash;I think justifiably&mdash;to reduce the time during which a prima facie hearing is conducted to five days, we must also ensure, by weakening the burden of proof that the Australian manufacturer has to discharge, that the five days can be met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendment No. 7 would impose the same evidentiary requirements on the Australian importer and overseas exporter as already exist for the local manufacturer under sections 269TB and 269TC. At present, the importer and exporter need not give the comptroller relevant information until after the comptroller has made a preliminary finding under section 269DT. This means that both the importer and the exporter can be selective in the preliminary information they give to the comptroller, whereas the local manufacturer cannot do so. This amendment, therefore, gives equal weighting to the evidence provided to the comptroller by all. In other words, it levels the playing field for Australian manufacturers. Once again, I am somewhat disappointed that neither the Government nor the Opposition is disposed to support this amendment which, I would have thought, was a matter of utter necessity for Australian manufacturers at this stage of our industry development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to address briefly the concept of the prima facie investigation of a dumping claim lodged by a manufacturer. The Minister claims that the Department needs 25 days to investigate the claim to prove that there has been dumping, that it affects similar products or that there is a similar industry in Australia, that the industry suffers damage and that there is a causal connection. In other words, the Minister and his Department are saying that it is not a prima facie case to initiate an inquiry but that the case must be proven. I believe that that is a rewriting of the concept of prima facie. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should move to a situation&mdash;and I believe it can be met within current GATT guidelines&mdash;where we can accept evidence from the manufacturer that a particular product is being landed and offered on the Australian market below the price at which it is offered in the country in which it is manufactured. I would have thought that written evidence of a price list from the country of origin and similar evidence of what is happening in the Australian market would be acceptable to establish a prima facie claim. I would have thought that if an industry was in a competitive situation but has against it a product well below the cost at which it was able to market its own product, it would be reasonable to infer that that industry would sustain some damage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> All that Australian manufacturers are asking is that an inquiry be initiated. I would have thought that, once these basic elements are provided by way of information from the manufacturer, the Department should not require any more than five days to do whatever checking it needs to justify the initiation of an inquiry. I know the argument has been advanced that the prospect of an inquiry provides something like a trade chill. So be it. What we are dealing with here is a series of defensive measures on behalf of our manufacturing industry, and I believe it is time that our Government took the side of Australian manufacturers rather than the side of importers and producers in other countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn briefly to tender dumping, the final issue I wish to raise, and foreshadow that I will be moving a second reading amendment. The Australian Democrats believe that the Government should institute a system of measures directed against tender dumping. This matter is currently being investigated by the Department. The Australian Democrats wholeheartedly recommend the implementation of a tender dumping process similar to that which exists in Canada. I foreshadow that I will move that the Government should institute a system of measures directed against tender dumping, and I understand that amendment will be circulated shortly. </PARA>

<PARA>The third was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The motor traders wishing to import used vehicles established that they were able to fully comply with all regulations and standards of Government and still develop a satisfactory market.</PARA>
<PARA>We learned of those three fundamental points early in the piece. In his speech, Senator Spindler used words such as `the case being proven', `prima facie' and so on. We were in quite a different position. We never reached that stage because no evidence was provided. I was absolutely staggered to find that we could go through the entire hearing without being provided with any information from all the gathered experts. Whether this was because they did not have the information or because they chose not to provide it is something that they alone will know. But I was very disappointed that over and over again we were getting sweeping generalities on a whole variety of subjects but very little evidence or even educated guesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same could be said of Senator Spindler. The general phrase he used was this one which he has used over and over again tonight&mdash;`large volumes'. I was trying to establish whether large volumes comprised 10 or 1,000 or 300,000, but nobody seemed to be in a position to tell me what a large volume was. That is because, of course, it had never happened. There was no evidence and there were no educated guesses by the officers involved.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These tables show that new car sales in 1991 totalled 393,000, of which 271,000 were locally produced and 122,000 were imported. When we were questioning the imports of these cars, we were trying to find out what the market would bear. The manufacturers could not tell us, the motor traders could not tell us and the motor vehicle authorities could not tell us. Clearly, the Industry Commission had never even considered it. The Department had not considered it. Yet we raced in and made this ridiculous decision with no evidence of any description. As early as April, in Estimates committee hearings, we asked one of the officers about the conditions in New Zealand and got the reply, `We have never considered New Zealand'. Yet the position in New Zealand was cited over and over again and became the basis upon which somebody produced the ridiculous figure of one million cars likely to be imported in three years. It is absolutely ludicrous for anybody to even suggest that such a figure could be possible. That it could be possible to find that many cars in the model that is approved or to wait for other models to be tested on the basis of about $1m a model to get them approved, get them organised, shipped, checked, replaced, distributed and sold, is absolutely ludicrous. We were told, `That is right; that is based on New Zealand figures'. It may be based on some New Zealand figure but it is not based on the conditions that apply in New Zealand.</PARA></TALK.START>

We are required to take this extraordinary step yet nobody could give us any information as to why it had not been dealt with by all the inquiries that had been undertaken, or why it was not even mentioned in the Automotive Industry Authority report, which came out only a month or six weeks ago. We are now taking this extraordinary move to try to clean it up. There must have been some terrible signals from overseas; and there must have been some absolute panic from the Minister's office down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was plenty of time, room and reason for this matter to have had a proper investigation. But there had been no research, back-up or authenticated estimate. There were no records. Witness after witness could not give us anything. With great respect, I believe that the jelly bean industry would have probably been better resourced than this inquiry found the car industry to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New Zealand question provided us with a lot of spasmodic information which turned out to be completely useless when we challenged and investigated it properly. There had never been a study of the New Zealand situation, despite the fact that that was where the panic really started. We were told the figures would show that we would only have to use a multiplier factor. As I say, that was worthless. According to the evidence that was given to us, nobody had been to New Zealand to check out the information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were not told that the average age of Australian cars of about five years has now blown out to eight or nine years, and that 47 per cent of all the cars on the road in Australia are over 10 years old, while New Zealand's cars are getting younger and younger. A whole variety of little matters like that are involved, but I will not go into them now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was clear from the lack of information we were given that the whole subject was not up for debate or discussion. If that was the case, the Government should have moved straight in and declared a ban in the first place, and we would have known where we were. But we were told that we could not do that because that is against GATT. I cannot really see that there is any difference between doing something openly and doing it by subterfuge if one wants to achieve the same result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were also told that there had been no discussion with the automobile association or the importers; that there had never been any question of voluntary restraint with a view to trying to establish whether there was a market for a number of these sorts of cars and, if so, how many and under what conditions. When giving evidence, there is nothing wrong in the manufacturers saying, `Look, we made an arrangement with the Government and we expect it to carry it through'. The dealers should not be ashamed to say, `Our job is to represent the interests of our members'. I would not hold that against them at all. But no, we could not get that sort of admission. All we got from them was, `Oh, no, we are doing this for the good of the customer because these cars are faulty and this and that'. They could not provide evidence for this. The best story we heard was that we might have trouble getting the manuals in English. That was about the most impressive thing we found. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Records are made to be broken and it was easily the most unimpressive Senate committee hearing I have ever sat on, and I now have sat on quite a few. I regret that the hearing became a bit of a farce because of the handling of the issue by the Government and the groups that were supporting the decision that it had made. I do not blame them for supporting it. It is in their own interests to support it, but the matter should at least be dealt with properly if it is to go before a Senate committee as an inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of whether imported second-hand cars would or would not compete with new Australian made cars was never clarified by the Government or its supporters. The information varies, but nobody was prepared to come forward and claim that a reasonable proportion&mdash;and probably a very substantial proportion&mdash;would be competing with second-hand cars. It was intimated to us at one stage, I believe by the manufacturers, that they were expecting approximately 150,000 second-hand cars a year to compete against the new car market. That is just nonsense, particularly as the figure it is based on is quite crazy. There was never any effort made to try to close the difference between the 40,000 cars that the importers believed was possible and the 330,000 cars that somebody dreamt up as a means of frightening the devil out of the industry, the Minister and everybody else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government, the Authority, the industry and the Industry Commission between them provided no information on the total car sales per year that would be involved. We were certainly disappointed that so little information could come forward. We certainly tried to get it. The manufacturing industry certainly is guilty of crying wolf at the time and I think it grossly misled the Government. The Government thought its most inadequate advice had got the better of it, panicked and raced to a conclusion to cover its inadequacies of knowledge and advice. I believe both the manufacturers and the Government will regret this as time goes by. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I fully understand the industry taking advantage of the Government for its own protection. I have no argument against the industry endeavouring to do that any time it likes, but it comes back to the fact that the Committee received grossly inadequate evidence on which it was impossible for a decision to be made. Of course, the issues are very wide and they require more proper research than we had the opportunity to do in the time available to us. Clearly, it has to come back to the Industry Commission, which should produce real evidence and make a recommendation to the Government on which mature and proper decisions can be made. I support the amendment moved by Senator Short. </PARA>

On cross-examination by myself and Senator Bishop on what sort of detailed analysis the Department had done on the situation in New Zealand, we were informed that no officers had bothered to travel to New Zealand, get any evidence from New Zealand or really give anything but a cursory glance at a few newspaper articles about the situation in New Zealand, before assuming from the submissions from the motor vehicle manufacturers in Australia that it would devastate the industry, that there would be all these old bombs driving around the place, that Australians would have to drive the Japanese hand-me-downs and that basically the sky would cave in if we allowed these imports to come in.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no surprise to see that the evidence before the Industry, Science and Technology Committee was less than satisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Button made it very clear during the discussion of the appropriations in the Committee of the Whole that the Government has decided that it does not want any of these imports. The $12,000 tariff is really a brick wall; it is not a tariff. The Government does not want these cars in here. As Senator Button said, if $12,000 did not stop them, the Government would put it up to $24,000. He has made the position quite clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very sad, of course, for the Taiyo Corporation, which has been dealing with this situation for four or five years now. It saw the Government's ADR approach to the problem back in 1988 and was clearly led down the garden path. It spent an enormous amount of money getting its Mazda 626 to comply with the Australian design regulations&mdash;which, we are informed by the Government, were initially designed to stop cars coming in at all, but of course these people diligently abided by the law and imported cars. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter was originally brought to our attention by Senator Panizza, who is interjecting. Senator Panizza has done a lot of work on this and should be congratulated for bringing it to the attention of members and senators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that Senator Panizza brought to our attention a few months ago is that these are hardworking, entrepreneurial people who saw the law and saw an opportunity to provide a product to the people of Australia at a reasonable price&mdash;to charge $11,000 or $12,000 for a very good quality Mazda 626 which totally meets Australian design laws. They appeal to what I think is a significant market. They appeal to low income earners, the sort of people whom the Labor Party used to represent&mdash;people who cannot afford to go out and buy a Commodore or a Falcon at $25,000, $26,000 or $27,000, but who can afford to finance an $11,000 or $12,000 car. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I were one of the vehicle manufacturers, particularly if I were Mazda, I would look at the long term and think about the young university graduates who might buy a second-hand imported Mazda 626, imported by Taiyo Corporation. They could pay $12,000, get the Mazda, enjoy driving it and then when they start earning more money they might decide to upgrade to a Mazda 929. But of course that is probably too far-sighted for some of the managers of the motor vehicle industry in Australia, because they have clearly opted for the short term choice of saying, `No, we don't want any competition. Let's go to our friend Senator Button and get a $12,000 dollar tariff whacked on'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those people who are considering this debate should look at the process by which this $12,000 tariff was arrived at. The Senate has already been informed that the Government tried to keep out these imports by imposing new design rules a few years ago. When that did not work it decided to put on a punitive $12,000 tariff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not read the full report of the Senate Standing Committee, but in all of its considerations no-one ever told the Committee&mdash;and I will stand corrected&mdash;why $12,000 was chosen. It literally doubles the price of these imported cars. I think the same effect would have been achieved with a $10,000 or a $6,000 tariff. I do not think any of the work done by the Department or anyone else really told us why it should be $12,000. That is relatively unimportant, except that it highlights the fact that very little research was done on this matter. Basically, the Government said, `We have got to stop these cars coming in'. If it meant sending a patrol boat and sinking the ships off the West Australian coast as they came down, I guess that would have been just as effective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Panizza said by way of interjection, the matter of compensation really confirms that the Government has admitted its guilt in this entire affair. It is going to spend some more taxpayers' money paying off Taiyo Corporation to compensate it for all the work it has done. But a much higher cost and much higher principles are involved. The cost that is involved, of course, is the cost to business in Australia generally. Here is a group of people who are prepared to find a market niche, who are prepared to meet a consumer demand in Australia, who are prepared to abide by the law, to invest all of their time, all of their money, take risks and undertake entrepreneurial activities. It then comes up against a big friend of the Government in the motor vehicle industry and against a Minister like Senator Button and a government that has no principles whatsoever, only the principle of getting re-elected. It is then told, `Sorry, mate, you have wasted your last three or four years; you can go home; go back to the drawing board; try something else'. That is what is stuffing this country. As the World Economic Forum and the International Institute for Management Development in Lausanne, in a report released last week, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the report singles out Australia's economic insularity, ineffectual management and woeful recent economic performance as the biggest obstacles to national competitiveness.</PARA>
<PARA>The report further said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although government fiscal and monetary policies are generally favourable, the legislative and regulatory environment are a draw-back. . . </PARA>
<PARA>The report quotes `improper practices and government efficiency and transparency' as real areas of concern. If a government keeps changing its policy, making policy on the run, creating a business environment where people will make a decision that is correct one day but find it ruled illegal the next day, we will not get people investing in Australia, we will not get management that is outward looking, we will not get management that is prepared to take risks, and we will not have an Australian economy that becomes internationally competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is, of course, a joke to have a Prime Minister and the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, the Leader of the Government in this place, going around saying that the great achievement of the Hawke-Keating years was to internationalise the Australian economy. In this most authoritative report on international competitiveness, which looks very closely at Australia and similar OECD economies, our great achievement is that in the last 10 years we have achieved a ranking on domestic economic strength of 17th out of 22 nations. Between 1991 and 1992 we have slipped from 20th to 21st out of 22 countries&mdash;a tremendous achievement by Paul Keating, the Prime Minister. It is one of his great claims over the last nine years. If he ruined the economy, if he scorched the earth, if he put a million people out of work, if he put 300,000 young people out of work, if he did one thing, it was to internationalise the economy. Where are we in 1992 in the internationalisation of our economy? After all these tremendous years of the world's greatest Treasurer, his greatest achievement, apart from making himself one of the wealthiest men in Australia and making the rest of us poor, is a ranking of 21 out of 22 on the world league table of internationalisation of our economy. </PARA>

That is exactly what has happened here. It is only a small example. It is only a small, fledgling industry that this Bill is going to knock out.

The Custom Tariff Amendment Bill 1992 relates to many customs tariff changes that have already been made or are about to take place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Custom Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill 1992 and the Customs Legislation (Tariff Concessions and Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill 1992 relate to changes that the Government has made to our anti-dumping and countervailing laws in response to the Senate inquiry which I initiated on behalf of the coalition in November 1990. Senator Button's Department had an inquiry into our anti-dumping and countervailing laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the Government on the changes it has made to our anti-dumping and countervailing laws. They were found necessary by the Senate inquiry in order to make these laws more effective. The Senate inquiry was set up in 1990 to look into our anti-dumping and countervailing laws. Prior to the Senate inquiry's report in June last year, the Government in its March industry statement picked up some of the terms of reference and shortened the time to establish a prima facie case from 55 days to 35 days. I believe that Senator Short will be moving an amendment to reduce that period considerably. The Government extended the period for duties to three years. It extended actions to farmers; it has half done that. In response to the Senate inquiry last December, Senator Button announced further changes which are being introduced in the Bills that are being debated today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of particular importance to any Australian industry suffering from the enormous burden of e growth in dumped products&mdash;a special aspect in these Bills&mdash;is the time limit for a prima facie case, which has been r puced a further 10 days to 25 days. The coalition, supported by the Australian Democrats, will move an amendment to reduce that to five days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These Bills follow up several of the Senate recommendations which were announced by Senator Button in his ministerial statement last December. Senator Button announced that other Senate inquiry recommendations would be implemented, such as Customs assisting applicants with certain information in the application form. The adoption of the recommendation to extend duties to five years is very welcome. The recommendation of a review prior to the expiry of the duties to see whether the duties should be continued will remove the difficult situation that presently exists where, once duties are lifted, Australian industries have to suffer a further period of material injury and then go through the long and expensive process of providing dumping before new duties are imposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, of concern is the matter of whether anti-dumping and countervailing remedies have been extended to primary producers. Before last year's changes, the action could be brought by the producer of light goods. As most imports are in the process form, it was up to the Australian processor of agricultural goods to bring the action. The March industry statement announced that the Government:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . will help our farmers and manufacturers take effective action against foreign producers who seek to dump theirCroducts on the Australian market at unfair prices.</PARA>
<PARA>When the Customs Tariff Act was amended last year, it was generally represented that the effect was to extend anti-dumping remedies to certain primary producers. This was to be done by extending the Act to persons producing raw agricultural goods from which processed goods are produced. However, a lot of uncertainty still remains as to whether anti-dumping actions have been extended to the affected primary producer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In practice, many primary producers are finding themselves in a difficult situation. The application form, as it now stands, requires certain information about the effect of imports on a processor's business. It is information that can only be supplied by a processor. Also, in practice, for any action to be taken, support must be provided for at least 50 of the Australian processors. Yet in reality some processors use dumped imports in their products. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Processors also benefit from an unrealistically cheap domestic price which has been forced down by the dumped import. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a situation that requires a little flexibility on the part of the Australian authorities. For example, a newcomer to the Australian dumping scene, subsidised Canadian pork, is flooding into Australia at the rate of $1.5m a month. Canada traditionally overproduces by 30 per cent and admits to subsidising its producers at 26c a kilo, or 17.5c of the price received by the Australian pig producer. Australian prices are forced down below the cost of raising pigs, despite our producers being internationally competitive in price and quality. Pork producers are having trouble in bringing anti-dumping action because processors must join with them and fill in a certain part of the application form. Some processors stand to gain if the dumping continues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has shown concern and consideration when this kind of conflict of interest has arisen between the primary producer and the processor. So it is surprising that this Bill contains an amendment that states that applications must strictly comply with all the paperwork requirements. This area of compliance is always governed by the general principle that evidence required is that which can be reasonably accessed, and the principle that an applicant can only make his best efforts to get data. Therefore, in view of the Government's intention to extend action so closely related to primary producers, considering how flexible its actions have been and in accordance with the well established principle of compliance, it does seem strange that at this stage the Government is moving to insist on strict compliance. I understand that the Democrats will support an amendment which has been moved by Senator Short to remove the word `strictly' from the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With food imports increasing each year and now being over $2.2 billion a year, and with massive subsidies continuing to distort world prices of agricultural exports leading to dumping, I support the strengthening and quickening of the procedures to enforce anti-dumping and countervailing actions in this <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"> I commend the Government for adopting many of the reforms suggested by the Senate inquiry.

The policies are the same except on those occasions when the car industry comes to town and scratches Senator Button's back and he rolls over, and except when there is a Wills by-election and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) goes down there and makes his own arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill comes at a time when the Government has told every industry&mdash;and I have, too&mdash;that it has to compete with the rest of the world. It comes at a time when the agricultural industry has to compete with that of other countries which produce at a much lower cost, and with those countries which make use of subsidies and quota restrictions. It comes at a time when New Zealand and Canada are dumping horticultural products and pig meat in Australia. As Senator Boswell said, it comes at a time when Canadian pork has nearly ruined the Australian pig industry, and continues to do so. It comes at a time when Queensland sugar growers have had their tariffs reduced from $77 to $55 a tonne. I support all of these measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is different when it comes to the Australian car industry&mdash;Senator Button's sacred cow. In 1986 we saw the beginning of the importation of used Japanese cars. In five years, 29,140 cars came in. The car industry saw this as a threat and so it used the non-tariff barrier instead&mdash;safety. Of course I support safety and I hope everyone else in this chamber supports safety. In 1989, their imports had to meet with the ADR. Most importers went away but Taiyo of Western Australia met the challenge. Mr Bob Brown said it was designed to provide a level playing field for both local and importing manufacturers. What happened to that, Senator Button?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taiyo spent $750,000 to meet the challenge for compliance with the Mazda 626 series. The company did everything that was asked including work on lights, brakes and seat belts. The car industry went to Senator Button and he obliged with $12,000 not even ad valorem. There was no IC inquiry, which is mandatory when any industry asks for help. But Senator Button got away with it by four days under the 12-month rule. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us explode a few myths about this: first, whether cars have been forced off the road in Japan; second, whether the cars comply with ADR&mdash;we have already dealt with that; third, whether in New Zealand the imported cars have decimated its industry; fourth, whether there is a lack of spare parts; and, fifth, what is the number of cars coming into Australia. Let us look at each myth. The first was that the cars were forced off the roads in Japan. In a press release Senator Button said that the Government was not willing to let into Australia cars forced off the road in Japan by tough registration laws which are there to undermine the Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happens in Japan is that, when people buy a new car, they buy a three-year licence for the equivalent of $A650. At the end of that the car is inspected and they pay $800 for two more years, plus new tyres, new brakes and a new battery which cost an extra $600. So it is only an extra $284 a year to license that car in Japan. Can Senator Button and all his advisers who have done nothing tell me how the cars are forced off the road, especially when a new car costs $20,000 to $25,000? It is illogical to say that they have been sent off the road. In the five years they have done only 20,000 kilometres, so what is wrong?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second myth concerns whether the cars comply with ADR. Of course they do; we have already gone into that. In 1989, the Government amended the Motor Vehicle Standards Act. Senator Cook said in his second reading speech on the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments proposed to the Motor Vehicle Standards Act demonstrate the continuing commitment by the Government to maintaining that a high level of safety is met by all road vehicles supplied to the Australian market for the first time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major amendment provides for a proper link between the Act and the Customs Act to ensure that vehicles are not allowed to enter Australia unless they meet the requirements of the Motor Vehicle Standards Act. It ensures that vehicles subject to the Motor Vehicle Standards Act will not be allowed to enter Australia without the specific approval of the Minister administering the Act.</PARA>
<PARA>The Government did not have the guts and determination to come out with the right reason in 1989; it used the non-tariff barrier. That is what happened. When Senator Button was challenged on this matter later on he said that anyone who thought the 1989 amendment on ADR was simply for safety was naive&mdash;it was his hidden agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the New Zealand experience: it is claimed that imported cars ruined the New Zealand car industry and reduced new car sales by 25 per cent. Well, in Australia sales went down by 19.7 per cent anyhow without the help of imported cars. However, the true picture is that locally assembled vehicles have dropped from 51,240 to 33,874&mdash;a drop of 38 per cent, although fully built new cars increased by 30 per cent. Australian distributors are continually advertising fully imported vehicles. I ask Senator Spindler to tell me where these Australian car manufacturers are being dinkum. They have convinced the Democrats to buy that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next myth is the lack of spare parts&mdash;what a joke. Mazda Australia cannot supply parts from the shelf for vehicles that are three years old. One may talk about Taiyo not being able to supply new parts for the vehicles it sells, but Mazda cannot supply parts for the 1988 model. Anyhow, Australian manufacturers only guarantee to have parts available for five years&mdash;but not off the shelf; delivery takes three or four days. Taiyo promises delivery within 48 hours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figure of one million has been bandied about as the number of second-hand cars that will come into Australia in three years&mdash;in other words, 333,000 per year. What a joke! The biggest seller of second-hand cars in Perth sells 4,800 per year. That is a lot of extra cars. The whole show is a fiasco. It makes a mockery of the Government's tariff reform policy. The Government should be consistent; it is guilty on its own admission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the Democrats could still look at where their support lies. Senator Sowada gives us every reason in her minority report why we should vote against this legislation. She has told the newspapers that she is going to vote against it. I give her credit that she is a Democrat with a bit of hope and a bit of sense. All the reasons are in this minority report. So I urge her not to listen to what the Government has to say, to vote with us and bring the rest of the crew with her. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been told that the cost of these cars in Japan is minimal. As I said earlier, in Japan cars such as these are not forced off the road. I think even Senator Short was a bit misguided. It costs only an extra $254 to keep one of these cars on the road in Japan. So there is no way anyone can say that these cars are forced off the road. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have some figures for what Taiyo may be paying for these cars in Japan. The cost of a used Capella or a Mazda 626 f.o.b. Japan is $2,200. The freight is $1,000. Import duty of 35 per cent and wholesale tax of 15 per cent adds $1,300 to the cost of this car. Work carried out in Australia&mdash;for example, on brakes, lights, tyres and whatever is needed&mdash;which puts it in a far better condition than any five-year-old Australian car that comes through the yards, adds up to $3,000. The total is $7,500. I know that Senator Button does not want to listen to this, but that adds up to a selling price of $10,000 to $13,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Button had thought the Australian car industry needed protection, he would have looked, without getting advice from anyone else&mdash;and I presume that he did not ask for advice, otherwise he would have come up with something that was not ad valorem&mdash;</PARA>

If I had spent $1m setting up a business and someone wanted to shut me down and buy me out so that I did not annoy them or provide competition, I would expect to make a profit on what I had put in.

The car manufacturers scratch Senator Button's back every now and then and plug fully imported cars. There is nothing at all wrong with fully imported cars, but why promote them? Mazda had a good run with its 626. This crowd was importing second-hand Mazda 626s. If Mazda or anyone else wanted to be dinkum about it, they would promote Australian manufactured or assembled cars. But no. That is where the whole legislation is a fiasco.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill has come at a very bad time. At the outset, I said that we are telling everyone in Australia that they have to compete internationally. Wheat farmers have been belted about the ears by the United States subsidy scheme and the EC subsidy. They are getting it good and proper. I have already mentioned the Canadian pig meat which is ruining pig producers in Australia. The sugar industry still has some sort of a tariff and it has to compete. But when it comes to the car industry it is vastly different. For all the reasons that I have outlined, this legislation needs to be looked at a second time. I ask Senator Sowada to try to talk some sense into Senator Spindler&mdash;the Volvo driving champion of the downtrodden. I appeal to the Democrats to think again and support us on this matter. We expect everyone else in this country to compete in the world. Jobs are being lost left, right and centre because of the way the Government has run the economy for the past 10 years. Why should the car industry not compete in the same way?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The myths that are being thrown around about second-hand Japanese cars are worthless.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise some important questions tonight in relation to Senator Cook's press release about the TAAATS inquiry mark II. At something after twelve o'clock at night, I do not propose to go through the history of how the Parliament got into the position of demanding an independent inquiry, but at the heart of the matter is the action of the Civil Aviation Authority. It has not followed accepted tendering procedures and, furthermore, it has failed to explain how it arrived at the decisions that it has arrived at when it has been given every opportunity to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter came to a head when the CAA virtually asked for an open cheque from the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works when the Committee was inquiring into a request from the Civil Aviation Authority to underwrite roughly $50m worth of a civil works program in relation to the TAAATS contract. That led the Chairman of the Public Works Committee, Mr Hollis, to say in a report to another place on 3 June that these concerns include the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . whether the Thomson equipment is the best available; whether the selection process conducted by the CAA was doctored to favour the Thomson bid; and why the preference of the technical and operational evaluation teams for Hughes was overturned.</PARA>
<PARA>Instead of doing what the Parliament wanted the Government to do, the Government turned to the Civil Aviation Authority to investigate itself. That was very like saying to a prisoner in the cell, `You can pick the judge, you can pick the jury, you can pick the prosecuting counsel and then you can write the charge you want to be charged with'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CAA did just that: it picked the chairman and it picked the consultants or advisers&mdash;one of whom, in one of the principal technical roles, was a Swedish company called Swedavia. Swedavia was in no sense an arm's length adviser. It has a long and proven history of association with Mr Baldwin, Mr Edwards and Thomson CSF in New Zealand. From there, it went on to write the terms of reference. The terms of reference of the first inquiry stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Was the selection process soundly based&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the answer to that is yes&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Was the process conducted in a fair and unbiased manner including:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Were any changes made to project objectives, Registration of Interest <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(ROI) requirements or evaluation procedures (including evaluation <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> criteria and delivery schedule) to favour or disadvantage any <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Company&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the answer to that would be no&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Was there any disclosure of information by the CAA which had the <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">effect of favouring or disadvantaging any Company or which <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> contravened commercial-in-confidence undertakings given to the <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Companies&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA>again the answer to that would be yes&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) Were the actions of the CAA Board on this matter in accordance with its obligations&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>of course, that would be yes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two things happened after that first inquiry. The first was that the person nominated as chairman, Mr Brazil, declared that he had a conflict of interest and quite properly withdrew as chairman of the selection process. I would like to quote from the relevant part of the letter tabled by Senator Cook in the Senate last week where Mr Brazil withdraws. He says in relation to his withdrawal:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is based both on professional requirements, and a concern that the proposed inquiry be free from any appearance of anything less than being fully fair and impartial. Personally, I was honoured by the request to chair the inquiry, and regret that this is no longer feasible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That was a quite proper action for Mr Brazil to take. The second thing that happened was that there was a public outcry at the CAA sitting in judgment of itself. That led to the mark II inquiry that was the subject of a press release yesterday from Senator Cook setting out slightly modified terms of an inquiry. That is why I seek the time of the Senate tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not here to argue about who the chairman should be. I think it is a great irrelevance to argue who the chairman might or might not be. My concern, and the concern of the Parliament, is that there be an independent inquiry set up. If Senator Cook can achieve an independent inquiry working through the CAA, he has my full support on it. But at the moment the portents for that to come about are not very favourable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is essential that we have an independent inquiry because it is the only way the Civil Aviation Authority can clear its name. It is the only way the board and the management can clear their names. I am surprised that someone like Mr Bosch cannot see that. Mr Bosch, I learned from Senator Cook's press release, is now the acting chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority. This is the same Mr Bosch who has gone around Australia for many years lecturing Australian business on morality and accountability on the boards of companies. We now have the opportunity for Mr Bosch to apply the ethical and correct principles that he has tried to instil in Australian business in the last decade into the actions of the Civil Aviation Authority. Unless we have an independent inquiry, the board of the CAA and the management will not be able to clear their own names of any allegations of impropriety which might or might not have taken place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to deal with the questions that arise from the press release issued by Senator Cook yesterday. I quote from the fourth paragraph first of all. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Macphee&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>who is the nominated chairman&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">as a first step will satisfy himself that the Terms of Reference are comprehensive enough to enable the Review to address all of the concerns which have been raised about the project.</PARA>
<PARA>What Senator Cook is saying, I take it, is that Mr Macphee, or whoever the chairman might be, will satisfy himself that the terms of reference are broad enough to cover anything in relation to the selection of Thomson as the preferred tenderer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first point that becomes apparent is that it will need time. For anyone who is not familiar with the subject, who has not been reading and does not know the tortuous path that has been followed over the last 18 months in relation to this contract, I think it would take at least three to four weeks of solid reading&mdash;there is at least a week in the Public Works Committee <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansards</EMPHASIS> to be got through&mdash;before one could make one's mind up as to what the correct terms of reference should be. That leads me to ask Senator Cook: if the terms of reference can be changed by the chairman, can they be changed once the inquiry gets under way? If they cannot be changed then, why not just give the inquiry open slather to look at all aspects of the selection program? That is exactly what Mr Hollis was saying when he presented the report of the Public Works Committee to the Parliament. The next paragraph of the press release says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Macphee will also choose the specialist advisers with the necessary technical and financial skills. He will draw on whatever advice he considers appropriate in their selection.</PARA>
<PARA>The choosing of the specialist advisers, both in a technical sense and in a legal sense, is absolutely crucial to the workings of this committee. The standard that needs to be applied is the standard laid down by Mr Brazil himself in his letter of resignation as the first nominated chairman that `anything less than being fully fair and impartial' will not be acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is possible to get advisers who are impartial, despite what Senator Cook told the Senate last week. From my own experience, I have been phoned up by several Australian companies in the field appropriate to assess air traffic control systems and they have offered their services to me. I have had phone calls from a number of individual consultants in the air traffic control field and from legal tender evaluation people. I have even had a phone call from someone from Canada. So the people are around, and I know from other sources that there are numerous people in the United States and in the United Kingdom who could act as independent consultants who have the technical and professional skills and the established professional integrity to operate in these fields. So those people are about. It is most important that the inquiry is not saddled with nominees by the Civil Aviation Authority. The third point in Senator Cook's press release relates to time. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important that the Chairman be satisfied that the Review has been given the necessary time to carry out its duties and finalise its report.</PARA>
<PARA>When the first version of this inquiry was brought out, the CAA decided that six weeks would be an adequate period in which to hold the inquiry. Such a proposition is quite ludicrous. I would not think an inquiry into the selection process could be held in much under three months, and it may well run considerably longer. I fully endorse the statement of Senator Cook that the chairman will be the person who makes the determination on the amount of time required for the report. The fourth point is a most important one. Two further paragraphs down, the press release states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, it will be a matter for the Review alone to determine the procedures under which it will operate and to ensure that there are arrangements in place which will respect necessary confidentiality of individuals and organisations making submissions during the Review's proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not think there is another aspect in the press release which is more important than that. Senator Cook is limited in the powers that he can confer on the chairman with respect to the confidentiality of individuals and organisations and, most importantly, with the protection he can offer witnesses. It is absolutely crucial to the findings and the workings of this committee that protection for witnesses is provided. It is the usual practice of this Parliament when we have an inquiry to grant the committee the powers to summon documents, to summon witnesses and to grant privilege to witnesses appearing and giving evidence before that committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cook cannot confer those powers on the chairman of the committee. To do that basically requires some legislation to be passed through this Parliament conferring powers similar to those of a royal commissioner. I do not see any sign at the present time of any legislation being introduced this week to create a committee of inquiry with those powers. If those powers are not conferred, I think the committee is going to get nowhere. The only other way it could be done would be by setting up a parliamentary committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to provide protection for witnesses; the actions of Mr Baldwin and Dr Edwards make it crucial. They make it crucial on two grounds. The first is in respect of the documentation. There is a known history of non-cooperation and evasion by the management of the CAA where evidence is trying to be collected. We have only to look at the long histories of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of the Public Works Committee hearings of the last two months to see that the CAA is simply not prepared to cooperate with the Parliament in providing evidence that the Parliament is properly entitled to collect. We have to look at the Senate Estimates committees, where again we get no cooperation at all from the CAA on the provision of essential evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As recently as a couple of weeks ago when the Appropriation Bills were passed through this chamber we had obdurate non-cooperation from Edwards and Baldwin on essential information in relation to this TAAATS contract. Unless the chairman of the committee has the power to compel the attendance of people and to compel the production of documents, essential information will not be provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another reason, apart from the documentary one, is for the protection of the individuals themselves. Both Dr Edwards and Mr Baldwin have a history of suing for libel. Last week someone in New Zealand telephoned me in my office and, amongst other things, told me that he was the subject of a libel action taken against him by those two people. There are allegations in the press gallery that Mr Tom Burton, a journalist with the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> have been the subject of a heavy writ. Furthermore, it is alleged that the CAA board has agreed to underwrite the costs of any legal action taken by Baldwin and Edwards in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that is true, it is quite extraordinary. It is one thing for an employer to help an employee by providing financial support if that employee is the subject of a legal action, but it is a totally different matter for a public servant to use taxpayers' funds to pursue a private citizen. I made a reference once to the actions of the Civil Aviation Authority being conducted along the lines of a Third World country. To allow an employee of the Civil Aviation Authority to pursue a third party in a libel action with taxpayers' money&mdash;if that is true&mdash;is another Third World practice. The upshot of this is that protection must be provided to the witnesses if people are to stand up and say something. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I am on the subject of New Zealand, I have had sent to me in the mail a cutting from a publication called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aviation News: New Zealand's National Aviation Newspaper</EMPHASIS>. The first paragraph of an article in that publication says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New Zealand and Australian members of Parliament have agreed to swap findings on separate investigations going on in both countries concerning multi million dollar tenders for calibration work and radar installation. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Centre of the investigations are ex-NZ Airways Corporation principles Frank Baldwin and Rob Edwards, both now working for the Australian Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know anything about that, but it is unusual that senior Australian public servants should be the subject of a major inquiry in the Parliament of another country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point I make is that the contract negotiations which are currently taking place between the preferred tenderer, Thomson, and the Civil Aviation Authority should cease while the inquiry is going on. Thomson is blackmailing the CAA by saying, `If you don't proceed with this, the introduction of the new air traffic control systems in Sydney and Brisbane will be deferred for years and you will have a major political issue on your hands, and probably a safety issue as well'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts of the matter are that the equipment at Brisbane and Sydney is old Thomson equipment that has been installed for about 30 years. Thomson has contracted to support that equipment with spare parts until about 1995, so there is a little leeway between 1992 and the expiration of that support program. Most importantly, an emergency kit can be moved in by a whole range of companies if Thomson cannot do it. Companies like Siemens, Hughes, IBM and Raytheon can certainly move in emergency air traffic control procedures to see us through in a short term crisis. There should be no pressure at all to carry on the contract negotiations while the inquiry into the selection of the preferred tenderer is taking place. I would be very grateful if the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, Senator Cook, would answer those questions in the Parliament within the next 24 hours. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to say a few words about the matter that Senator MacGibbon has raised tonight. Firstly, I congratulate Senator Cook, as the Minister responsible for the Civil Aviation Authority, for announcing yesterday the appointment of Mr Ian Macphee to chair the independent inquiry into the letting of the contract for air traffic control, as described by Senator MacGibbon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator MacGibbon is well known in this place for having raised this issue in the Estimates Committee and with other members of parliament over many months. I have been lobbied by the contractors, as I suppose he has. Representatives of AWA, which is a part of the Hughes consortium, and representatives of Thomson-CSF have come to see me in recent times to outline their cases on this issue. I do not believe it is appropriate for members of parliament to try to be technical experts and to pick between Thomson-CSF, one of the major tenderers, and the Hughes Corporation, the other major tenderer. We may be expert amateurs, but we are all amateurs. I think that if we start trying to argue the technical merits we will find ourselves getting into a fair bit of strife. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past five years that I have been a member of this place, I have had briefings from Thomson on other contracts it has bid for, some of which have been based in South Australia. As well, I have received briefings from AWA. My interest is because they have been based in South Australia, and employment opportunities and the development of high-tech industry in South Australia are things I support strongly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of these queries and matters of controversy have been raised in recent times. Several weeks ago I took the trouble to get hold of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansards </EMPHASIS>of this place to see all the questions that have been asked by members opposite. I am not a member of the appropriate Estimates Committee, but I read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansards</EMPHASIS> of the Committee hearings in which many questions were asked on this matter earlier this year. I sat down and laboriously read the transcripts of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works on this contract. After several hours of reading, I became concerned that the processes of the CAA in letting the contract for this large capital expenditure for air traffic control were, to quote Tom Burton from one of his articles in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, `rather odd'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been an observer and have asked questions and been briefed in the Department of Defence where it has let contracts of a measurably larger size than in the air traffic control area. The Defence Department has let the Anzac frigate contract, which was worth $5 billion or $6 billion, and the submarine contract, which was worth $4 billion or $5 billion. In those contracts there were big winners and big losers. In all of those contracts, the losers, despite some initial disappointment and a few comments that they thought they had been hard done by, basically accepted the decision. However, in this case, when the contract was finally let in March this year to Thomson-CSF, there was such an outcry from across the industry about the way the process was conducted that it seemed to me that there was a real reason for a review of the way this contract was let. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think anyone who reads the Public Works Standing Committee transcripts would be other than unimpressed by the performance of the senior officers of the CAA, Mr Baldwin and Dr Edwards, in their inability to answer quite reasonable questions to the statutory authority responsible for approving these sorts of expenditures&mdash;that is, the Public Works Standing Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some time ago there was a debate about whether under commercialisation such authorities as the Civil Aviation Authority should have themselves removed from the surveillance or the overseeing of the Public Works Standing Committee. This recent episode proves a very strong case for why the Public Works Standing Committee of this Parliament should maintain some surveillance of major contracts of bodies such as the CAA, even though it has a commercial obligation and a commercial charter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that, if it had not been for the Public Works Standing Committee's ability to ask the questions and call for evidence, we probably would not have got a review. I think the members of that Committee, particularly Mr Hollis, the Chairman, are to be congratulated for not putting up with some of the obfuscation that had come from senior officers of the CAA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To me, the most fundamental issue about this whole process is to ensure that any government department or authority has an open, transparent set of rules about the way it lets contracts. I understand that in the Defence Department those rules have been rigorously adhered to. There are always winners and there are always losers. But, if one loses in a decent tendering process, one has only oneself to blame for not being good enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that, with the apparent lack of transparency, the clear-cut rules by which this contract was let and the process adopted, we could not have confidence that all reasonableness was adopted and all fairness was applied to all tenderers. As a result, Thomson-CSF, as a major tenderer, has copped a bit of flak that it probably does not deserve. The process the CAA adopted for letting the tender gave rise to suspicions on the part of some people that Thomson-CSF was getting an inside running for its own advantage. That may be the case; it may not be. But I suspect&mdash;and I told this to Thomson-CSF officials when they came to see me&mdash;that its reputation has been unduly affected because of the way in which the CAA went about letting the tender. All of that is on the record in the transcripts of the Public Works Standing Committee. Of course, a couple of those hearings were held in camera, and the transcripts are not available to other members of the Parliament who are not members of the Public Works Standing Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that Mr Ian Macphee, a former senior Minister in a former government of this Parliament, a longstanding member of this Parliament and a representative of an employer organisation in Victoria before he came into the Parliament, is a person who has a good range of commonsense experience. Although he may not have all the technical requirements and expertise that Senator MacGibbon would like, he certainly has the experience in government and parliament to be able to make a proper investigation and ask the decent questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator MacGibbon's concerns are realised in relation to witnesses being afraid of giving evidence or information to him because they do not have parliamentary privilege or protection as in a court, I am sure that Mr Macphee, in carrying out his duties, will report that to the Minister. If he finds that the technical advice that he is getting is inadequate, I am sure he will make the appropriate request to the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the concerns that Senator MacGibbon raises, we ought to see how things develop before we jump to the conclusion that Mr Macphee is not able to conduct a decent inquiry. I am confident that if the obstacles that Senator MacGibbon has outlined tonight arise, Mr Macphee, with all</PARA>
<PARA>his political experience as both a Minister and member of parliament and with his experience in industry, will be making a request to the Minister for an adjustment to his terms of reference to give him the appropriate powers to investigate all aspects of this particular tender. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that at the end of the day we can establish for the CAA a set of rules and procedures for letting major tenders that advantage the CAA but, above all else, advantage the Australian taxpayer, and that we have an open, transparent and firm set of rules which gives confidence to people all around Australia and the world to tender openly for contracts, knowing that they have a reasonable chance in an open competition to win that tender. Once that is established, the CAA will be able to provide to the Australian public a very decent air safety regime in this country that we all want. </PARA>

The Commonwealth's decision to assist with the start-up costs of the MFP reflects the particular nature of the project and the consequent need, in the initial stages, to coordinate its various diffuse elements and to identify and remove any impediments to its further development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The MFP is also intended to act as a catalyst for the further restructuring and internationalisation of Australian industry. The Commonwealth's contribution to the project will therefore help to establish a springboard for concrete private sector business proposals to be brought forward for inclusion in the MFP. The Government's view is that these individual ventures are expected to stand or fall on the basis of their commercial viability&mdash;as is the case with projects such as the VFT and the Cape York spaceport.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Bureau of Air Safety Investigation inquiry phase has been completed, but continuing research is being undertaken and this will delay the publication of the final report. At this stage the Bureau cannot predict when the report will be finalised, but it is expected that the various interested parties will be provided with a draft report during July 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The actual incident appears to have been triggered by a meteorological phenomenon, which resulted in a very unusual temperature variation. Effectively, the outside air temperature rapidly increased and the engines suffered a power decrease, commonly referred to as a "roll-back". It appears that the engines may then have been affected by icing conditions which delayed the recovery process until the aircraft had descended through the icing level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The altitude limitation of 28 000 feet in non-icing conditions was imposed by the CAA on Australian operated BAE 146 aircraft as a precautionary action, pending investigation of the Western Australian incident. The basis of the limitation was that none of the known multiple engine power loss events world-wide, including the Western Australian incident, had occurred below an altitude of 28,000 feet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This limitation has now been relaxed to permit day operations in non-icing conditions up to 31,000 feet, in line with the manufacturer's suggested limitation. The altitude limitation of 28,000 feet in non-icing conditions has been retained for night operations at this time, but will be reviewed as further information is received from manufacturers on the engine power loss problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The 28,000 feet limitation introduced by the Australian CAA applies to operations in non-icing conditions, whereas the altitude limitation of 25,000 feet introduced by the UK CAA, which has also been imposed by the Australian CAA on Australian operated BAE 146 aircraft, applies to operations in known or forecast icing conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The Australian CAA was briefed in Canberra, on 5 May, by a team from the BAE 146 aircraft and engine manufacturers on the current status of their investigations into the engine power loss problem and recommended corrective actions. The team also presented details of their continuing action plan and gave assurance that the Australian Authority would be kept informed as the plan progressed. Dialogue is also continuing between the Australian CAA and the regulatory authorities of the UK, USA and New Zealand, as well as the Australian operators of the BAE 146 aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) Details of modifications to BAE 146 aircraft engines and engine fuel control units, recommended as corrective action for the power loss problem, were given by the manufacturer's team at the Canberra meeting in May.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) The Australian CAA considers the BAE 146 aircraft to be safe and that the altitude limitations currently imposed on Australian operated BAE 146 aircraft, in particular the limitation of 25 000 feet in known or forecast icing conditions, will prevent the occurrence of an engine power loss incident similar to the Western Australian event.</PARA>
