<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I ask: is it still the view of the Minister that the Khmer Rouge are cooperating in the peace process in Cambodia?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1267" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is the case that the Khmer Rouge have not been especially cooperative in recent times, at least some elements of them, and quite specifically in the Kompong Thom Province where questions do arise about their commitment to the cease-fire agreed last year and about their commitment to the process. Nonetheless, the latest reporting from our mission in Phnom Penh indicates that slow but steady progress is being made in re-establishing the cease-fire and in bringing about a disengagement of the forces.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a series of cease-fire violations since February this year. It has involved troops of both the state of Cambodia and the Khmer Rouge. It seems to represent something of a last-ditch effort by both of those factions to extend their territory and influence before the UN troops move in. I do not think it should be seen as any full-scale effort to undermine the settlement. I remain firmly of the view, as I have been from the outset, that the Khmer Rouge lack the capacity to do that in the absence of support, externally, from China, that that support is not now forthcoming and, on the best judgments I and the international community can make, will not be forthcoming in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Chinese Government, on the face of it and from all available evidence, remains wholly committed to the cease-fire process and indeed the whole settlement process. Against that background, it would be very difficult indeed for the Khmer Rouge to seriously undermine that process. Nonetheless, we do not indicate any degree of complacency about the situation. Obviously it is not without risks. We knew that there would be such risks in the whole development of the peace process. We knew there would be difficulties along the way. We are seeing some of those difficulties at the moment, but I do not believe that they are in any way destructive of the peace process; they are just exactly the kinds of things that we might expect at this stage.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Has the Minister also addressed reports of intimidation by the Khmer Rouge within the camps of those who have volunteered to return under the auspices of the United Nations? What degree of bad faith and failure to cooperate in this plan do the Khmer Rouge need to demonstrate to the Minister before the Minister will realise that this is putting the peace process in jeopardy?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1267" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There have been some such reports of bad faith on the part of the Khmer Rouge in the camp situation. They are not unexpected, given the track record of the Khmer Rouge over a long period. It does not mean that we are in any way happy about them. Again, to make the judgment that this is somehow putting the whole peace process at risk is fundamentally to misconceive the nature of that process and the dynamics that are at work behind it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the Opposition&mdash;and Senator Hill, in particular&mdash;have made it their business to misconceive the notion of the peace process all along. Senator Hill has been utterly unable to contemplate with good grace that we might conceivably be doing something that will bring about a lasting peace and lasting justice to the Cambodian community. He has been carping about this in a negative fashion throughout the entire history of this process. He has been doing everything he possibly can to undermine the credibility of that process, to undermine the morale of the people on the ground and to undermine the capacity of the Cambodian people to effectively deal with the problem they are dealing with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Hill was put very comprehensively in his place by Malcolm Fraser over the weekend. He was put even more comprehensively in his place this morning by Ian Harris, the Executive Director of CARE, who made the point on a number of occasions in a radio interview that what Senator Hill and the Opposition are doing is destructive of the peace process, destructive of the situation on the ground and utterly at odds with what needs to happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a very important sense in which we all ought to appreciate and ask ourselves just what the alternatives are to this particular peace process working itself out in the way in which it is laboriously doing it at the moment. The alternatives are simply dreadful. I will leave out all the whacking around the ears Mr Harris gave the Opposition; I will focus simply on one very positive point that he made at the end of his comments this morning, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is our last chance for peace in Cambodia and unless everyone gives it their best shot then Cambodia's just going to disintegrate and we're going to have this fermenting sore in Indo-China for goodness knows how many years.</PARA>
<PARA>He made the point&mdash;as I have made the point on innumerable occasions&mdash;that the Opposition is just not interested in giving this issue its best shot. I believe&mdash;and I think the overwhelming majority of Australians believe&mdash;that it should be doing just that. It should stop its carping, stop its misery, stop its grandstanding, stop its political opportunism and stop its attempts to try to build itself some political space on which it can stand and crow `I told you so' in the unhappy event that something may go wrong. Of course there are risks associated with this process, but the crucial thing is that we work together to minimise those risks, not talk down a process which is the only chance the Cambodian people have of a lasting peace.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce seen comments at the weekend on the future of the passenger motor vehicle industry by the President of Ford Australia, Mr Jac Nasser? In the light of those comments, can the Minister advise the Senate of the importance to the car industry of a stable certain policy framework? Has the Minister had examined the impact on the car industry of a policy based on zero tariffs?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1268" SPEAKER="Button Sen The Hon J.N." NAMEID="4F4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, TECHNOLOGY AND COMMERCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen Mr Nasser's comments and I have heard Senator Alston's interjection, which is that Mr Nasser went on to say that if nothing else changes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Newman" NAMEID="BE4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was my interjection.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I apologise to Senator Newman, but Senator Alston got in first. It should have been a case of ladies first. The fact is that Mr Nasser did make that statement. It is useful to look at the proposals which are there for the car industry. That industry needs a clear policy framework from government. The stability of that framework is crucial to the industry's transition from one which is inward-looking and highly protected to one which is genuinely internationally competitive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the industry statement of March last year the Government detailed the policy arrangements for this industry through to the year 2000. I notice that immediately after that statement of 12 March last year the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was, therefore, most pleased to see that the Prime Minister has moved towards&mdash;and I emphasise `towards'&mdash;our tariff decision in Tuesday's statement. I congratulate him on his move in this direction, although he will still have 25 per cent protection in the textile, clothing and footwear industries and 15 per cent protection in the auto industry by the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA>It suited Dr Hewson to make that distinction between the Government's tariff policies and the Opposition's tariff policies on 14 March last year. But on 26 March 1992 he said in a press release:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister's attempts to portray his tariff policy as distinct from the Coalition's is pure disinformation aimed at the Wills electorate.</PARA>
<PARA>We should be very careful to take account of Dr Hewson's words of 14 March 1991 which, presumably, he made in a response to the statement of Government policy on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From January next year, the tariff rates for PMVs will be 32.5 per cent, phasing down to 15 per cent in the year 2000. By that time the Government's tariff policy will be 15 per cent for cars, up to 25 per cent for TCF and 5 per cent for general tariffs. That compares with the zero, zero, zero options or negligible, negligible, negligible options of the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Nasser made the point at the weekend that zero tariffs or very low tariff levels would make it extremely difficult to justify new investments in the Australian automotive industry. Of course, there are reasons for that. The industry is foreign owned and competing for investments with other countries. The size of the market in Australia&mdash;it is a volume industry&mdash;has to be taken into account in order for the industry to survive, and it has to move to higher levels of exports.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not believe that and I have never believed that. In 1984 the Government achieved an historic agreement with the trade unions in this industry that employment in the industry would fall as tariffs came down. We have said that consistently and it has been understood by all sides in the industry policy debate. The important thing about tariff reductions is that we reduce costs to the Australian consumer and, at the same time, put a realistic degree of pressure on the Australian industry to adjust and become more internationally competitive.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Hill says that that is too slow. That sounds funny coming from a member of a government which did nothing throughout the 1970s&mdash;in fact, raised tariffs in the 1970s and did nothing about micro-economic reform. In terms of getting a realistic phase-down of protection, many in the coalition are worried about Dr Hewson's change of views in the context of the Wills by-election. For example, last week Senator Boswell said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You can't have Australia completely unprotected, completely working on an open market. A zero tariff policy is just not being realistic.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Boswell said that in relation to primary industries, essentially. The point is that the coalition cannot have it two ways: it cannot have zero levels of protection for manufacturing industry and higher levels of protection for primary industry in the same coalition policy. I would have thought there would be grave difficulty in doing that. Senator Boswell, who went on to say that he had had regular exchanges of views with Dr Hewson about this issue, confirmed his view on the radio at the weekend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is that the Government has a stable reduction policy for tariffs and protection; it has been successful in helping internationalise the Australian motor vehicle industry. The industry which never exported anything when those opposite were in government is now exporting $1.2 billion worth of components and vehicles, and will continue to increase that performance as it internationalises and becomes more globally competitive. That can only be done in a regime which is sensible and which provides for a practical transition from high protection, which those opposite imposed on it, to low protection, which we are seeking.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. It follows the answer he gave to my colleague Senator Hill a short time ago. I ask the Minister: has he seen reported comments in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> by the commander of the Cambodian peacekeeping forces, General Sanderson, who said that under the terms of the Paris peace agreements last October peacekeeping forces cannot be sent into a `hot war' situation but only monitor and verify a cease-fire? Does the Minister agree with this statement by General Sanderson? In the light of the current increased tempo of fighting in Cambodia, which the Minister has acknowledged is occurring, what impact does that have on the timetable for the deployment of the main Australian peacekeeping force?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1270" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen the reported comments of General Sanderson and I do agree with them. It is the case that under the UN peace plan, the role of the UN forces, the military forces, is not that of peace enforcement in the sense of actively intervening to stop a conflict presently being waged. It is rather the role of peacekeeping, which is to monitor, verify and supervise a peace settlement already in existence and an associated cease-fire.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty is that we are in a transitional situation where the cease-fire has been agreed to but violations are occurring; that is not unknown in these situations. The judgment that General Sanderson and the UNTAC forces generally have to make is how they handle themselves on the ground in response to that. What General Sanderson is reported as saying is that he would be looking for the factions to agree to proposals for the separation of forces in those areas. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If that eventuates . . . I've told them I'll be prepared to put UN troops in there. . . . I can't put troops in there until it's clear where everyone is and what they are prepared to do.</PARA>
<PARA>That is an exact statement of the situation.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Under those circumstances, one would not expect Australian troops or any other UNTAC troops to be put at risk of involvement in a separation exercise. That is not what they are there for. They are there to monitor, supervise and verify a settlement, once reached, and a cease-fire that is in existence. What we all have to try to do is ensure that the cease-fire is honoured and observed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said in response to the earlier question, I do not believe that there is any evidence for claiming that the situation is in any way out of control in this respect or that the settlement process is, in some fundamental way, at risk. There are always going to be risks associated with this process. We know very well the risks associated with mines and disease. There are also the associated risks of troops being caught up in cross-fire that might develop out of a clear blue sky or in the kind of situation in which Colonel Stuart unhappily found himself with random fire at his helicopter in a situation where he was just simply scrutinising and seeking to establish the basis for a later involvement of troops on the ground. This is exactly the sort of situation that could have been anticipated, given everything we know about the problems over a long time in Cambodia. Again, I ask that the Opposition contribute in a constructive and bipartisan way to this whole enterprise rather than carping, criticising and trying to talk the situation down.</PARA>

In the light of the answer that Senator Evans has just given, I refer to the part of my question which he did not answer: what effect have the events which he has just described had on the timetable for the deployment of the main Australian force?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is quite premature to make any judgment about that. The troops will be deployed in the first instance&mdash;infantry, communicators, which is the role that Australia is playing, and logistic support troops&mdash;as possible into Phnom Penh, into the initial catchment area. When they will be deployed in the other regions of the country, in particular those where there is some doubt about whether the cease-fire is holding, will be a matter for the judgment of the force commander.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Victoria, keen interest is being taken in the Port of Melbourne Authority's stimulation of the private sector involvement in developing East Swanson Dock into a world class container and intermodal facility. I am pleased to say that only last week the Northern Territory Government announced, through its Minister for Transport and Works, Mr Fred Finch, that a pacesetting agreement had been reached with the Waterside Workers Federation&mdash;which now represents both the Port Authority and the waterside work force in Darwin&mdash;for the introduction of an integrated work force whereby Port Authority labour will be available to supplement stevedoring labour with significant cost savings to the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Darwin waterfront has already seen a cutting in half of its stevedoring work force and a 30 per cent reduction in the labour hire-out rate since August last year through reforms that have been accomplished under the Federal Government's waterfront reform program. All of this cooperative reform effort being progressed by State and Territory governments contrasts very starkly with the Opposition's approach to port authority reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have advised the Senate on previous occasions, the Opposition's one contribution to port authority reform was the rather startling proposition that port authorities in Australia should be privatised. In other words, the Federal Government should propose that port authorities which are owned by State governments&mdash;the Federal Government does not own them&mdash;should be privatised. Not only has this so-called initiative not been greeted with any support whatsoever, but the New South Wales Government has specifically repudiated such a proposition.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government did table its response to the recommendations of the national inquiry into racist violence. I think it was in mid-December last year that the Attorney-General put down a statement in the House of Representatives. Earlier this year he wrote to his counterparts in the States drawing their attention to that response and seeking their active support in implementing the measures that need to be taken to ensure that Australia does not have those features of a racist society, or tolerate within it expressions of racism by individuals or by groups.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that a joint ministerial forum is scheduled to take up these matters. Also, this can be linked to the necessary response by all governments to the report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. Both reports note those measures which need to be taken, particularly in changing the culture. The report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody contains measures in relation to the police force and the court officers who find themselves at the front line of dealing with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. That is not to say that those particular groups&mdash;the police and the court officers&mdash;are more racist than any other part of the Australian community. It is just that, quite clearly, they have more occasion to come into contact with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. There are so many occasions on which, rather than these people being able to be diverted away from those particular processes&mdash;as is recommended by the Royal Commission&mdash;they come into contact with the law enforcement agencies in a particularly harsh way at times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the Minister, Mr Tickner, held a meeting with his counterparts last Friday in Melbourne. It is quite clear that there is still a way to go to ensure that the States assume their responsibilities in regard to meeting the recommendations of that particular Commission. However, the Australian Police Commissioners Council has taken a joint approach to improving the training of police. There will be cross-cultural training programs. In particular, I am very confident that the selection of trainees now being undertaken in the various police forces is being done in such a way that initially they will be capable of benefiting from training which will ensure that in their contact with members of the community and minority groups they will demonstrate the sensitivity which, perhaps, has not been required of them by the Australian community hitherto.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The weird thing about this question is that all of the estimates for our labour market reform program have been through the scrutiny, in successive Budgets, of the Estimates committees and the Committee of the Whole, and approved. On the advice before me, the allegation of a blow-out is not justified at all. We are within program expenditure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have here a series of allegations. It should be said that our union rationalisation program is part of an overall program for labour market adjustment which this Government is running. If one looks at the expenditure in the budgetary years 1990-91 and 1991-92, we have spent a total of $18.9m in the labour market adjustment program. Of that $18.9m, $11.2m has gone to employer organisations or employers; $5.8m has gone to trade unions; and $1.9m has gone to joint bids by employers and trade unions acting together. As a consequence of that, almost twice as much as has gone to trade unions has gone to individual employers and employer organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The labour market adjustment program is the reason there is now a revolution in the Australian workplace. It is the reason we have seen a low level of industrial disputes, success in award restructuring, the reform of workplace and managerial practices, and a change from the previous climate of conflict to a climate of cooperation in the Australian workplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The union rationalisation program is based on unions deciding to amalgamate, consistent with our objective of reducing the number of trade unions in Australia. That is an objective supported by the Jackson report into manufacturing industry in 1975, the Coombs Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration in 1976, the Myers report on technological change in 1980, the Hancock report in 1985, the Pappas Carter report in 1990 and Business Council of Australia surveys.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of those reports to government, not only our Government but previous governments as well, have supported the need to reduce the number of trade unions in Australia. That program has supported that objective. It has increased the flexibility in the workplace for employers. It has meant that career-pathing has been able to be introduced. It is a pre-condition for effective workplace bargaining and it has an absolutely dramatic effect on reducing the number of demarcation disputes where there is more than one union claiming the right to work in a particular workplace. It underpins our 1990 legislation and it is for the particular costs where unions, as independent organisations, have decided of their own volition, without direction from this Government, that they wish to amalgamate. We then support that decision by information and educational programs and the defrayment of some of the excessive legal costs that have been hitherto involved in the proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last part of this very silly question, I must say, goes to an allegation that, in doing this, we are somehow contravening ILO conventions. I might say I am very pleased that the Opposition has discovered ILO conventions because I expect it will hear more about them from the Government as the course of our term continues.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Zakharov raises in a timely way the question of the way in which the Australian community ought to deal with the problem of unsafe products in the marketplace. It is interesting that you, Mr President, have just acknowledged the presence in the chamber of the members of the Bundestag, because last year I was in Bonn and had the opportunity of looking at the working of the European directive on product liability in conjunction with their Ministry for Justice. Indeed, it is that particular directive which will be adopted in Australia, and also by our trading partners in north Asia, as the model for product liability legislation. I hope that that legislation will be passed during the course of the autumn sittings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is one thing to have legislation in place,  and even acknowledge in a spasmodic or anecdotal way the various injuries and loss to property that occur as a result of defective products, but it is another thing to have a comprehensive, Australia-wide view of what is going on. I believe that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Investigators</EMPHASIS> did a great service to the Australian community by pointing out that there is a very real need to have a coordinated Australia-wide register of accidents as they occur as a result of defective products in the marketplace. We are moving in that direction in a reasonably satisfactory way, although certainly more is required to be done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consumer affairs agencies do coordinate well but, as the coroner in the Mistral fan tragedy pointed out, some agencies&mdash;such as electricity authorities which test electrical products and become aware of deficiencies in certain electrical products&mdash;have not been so forthcoming in passing on that information to consumer affairs authorities. There has been something of a gap and such a gap can have tragic consequences if the Australian community is not alerted to dangerous electrical faults that can occur in some products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the casualty sections of Australia's major hospitals have been involved&mdash;and this has been organised by the Australian Institute of Health&mdash;in putting together a surveillance of major injuries presenting at their casualty departments and accident units. This is already proving to be very helpful. Some 22 hospitals are involved in this program Australia-wide, including the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne, Camperdown in Sydney, Westmead in Sydney, the Mater Adults and Children's Hospitals in Queensland, and so on. Through the experience of these casualty wards, we are receiving very good data on various injuries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently it has emerged that exercise bikes are a cause of young children attending these casualty departments; not from falling off the bicycles or anything like that, but simply because they have caught their fingers in the spokes or the chains of these exercise bikes.

I refer to job forecasts in the economic statement which indicate that some 200,000 jobs could be generated in the tourism industry between now and the end of the decade. I ask the Minister: firstly, what relationship does this figure bear to the 800,000 jobs outlined in the One Nation statement which may be created over the next four years? Secondly, in which particular sectors of the tourism industry will this job growth occur? Finally, has any real planning been done by this Government on tourism employment growth and, if so, what, or are these jobs just wishful thinking on behalf of Mr Keating?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, the Minister for Tourism has provided me with the following response to Senator Sowada's question: the estimate that 200,000 jobs will be created in the tourism industry is completely consistent with the Government's forecast of 800,000 jobs over the next four years. The Department of Tourism forecast is based on an occupational forecasting study undertaken by DEET using the Work Force 2000 model. Information input into the model included growth forecasts in domestic and international tourism over the decade.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the 1990s, 208,000 jobs will be generated in the tourism industry, of which 150,000 will be as the result of international tourism. It is estimated that between 12 and 16 per cent of all new jobs over the decade will be in the tourism industry, bringing to 6.3 per cent the proportion of the work force employed in tourism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A full labour force planning study commissioned by DEET, in cooperation with the Department of Tourism and Tourism Training Australia, is nearly complete.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, not this time. It is Mr Jull, I regret to say. He is normally accurate on these issues. The story opens with a paragraph that says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two key new air services from Korea and Taiwan have had to be cancelled because of the "inadequacy" of the Brisbane International Airport terminal, according to the Federal Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Jull goes on in his press statement to make the even more astonishing claim that the extended apron facilities at the international terminal in Brisbane have not been completed and that this is the cause of the problem and will exacerbate it in the future.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The story is completely wrong. As the manager of the Brisbane airport has said, the airport has had no difficulty with any scheduling in its current season and will not have any difficulty in its scheduling for the coming season.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statement by Mr Jull is based on an answer which I gave to a question on notice about a week ago, I recall. I said that restrictions on apron usage at Brisbane had led to two services&mdash;an Australia-Asia flight from Taiwan and a Qantas flight from Seoul&mdash;not being allocated, I stress this, a suitable slot for the northern winter scheduling period by the IATA scheduling conference. Without bothering to check the detail of that, Mr Jull just leapt into print with his astonishing statement that this was `a big setback for tourism in Queensland' and then went on to say that the apron facilities at the international terminal had not yet been completed. The facts are that the northern winter schedule that I referred to in that answer finishes tomorrow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Qantas and Australia-Asia airlines have both advised me that they currently have no plans to increase any of their services through Brisbane to Seoul or Taiwan in the near future. In other words, there has been no setback to any tourism planning by the airlines at all. To put the final nail in the coffin of this extraordinary piece of misinformation, as I said, in his press statement Mr Jull claimed that the apron that would allow for these additional aircraft spaces had not been finished. The facts are that not only has the apron been finished, but also it was opened for use on 13 March 1992&mdash;one week before Mr Jull issued his press statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The FAC is working closely with major airlines to accommodate projected growth and is confident that the terminal and the airport can cope adequately with the expected growth. I conclude by reminding honourable senators that the Prime Minister, in his One Nation statement, committed the Government to cooperatively working with the FAC to ensure that the new international airport terminal at Brisbane will be completed by 1995.</PARA>

<PARA>In Question Time today Senator Button, in response to a question from Senator Sherry about tariffs in the motor vehicle industry, gave the very clear impression in his answer that under the coalition's policies the motor vehicle industry would be in a more difficult situation than it would be under the continuation of the Government's policies.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;By seeking to disallow regulation 30 of the Austudy regulations I am attempting to retain the status quo regarding the sibling concession to the parental income test. Somewhat misleadingly, the explanatory statement accompanying the regulations states that the change which I am attempting to negate will mean that the abatement to the parental income test to allow for dependent children `will be simplified'. `Simplified' is the wrong word. In some cases parents will now receive nothing and in other cases they will receive drastically reduced amounts compared with what they received last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These changes were announced at the time of last year's Budget but came into effect on 1 January 1992. It is only now, as universities are getting back into full swing, that parents are realising the drastic effect that the implementation of this change is having on the amounts they receive. Prior to the change the sibling concession worked in the manner that for every $4 extra earned by parents over the threshold family income for full Austudy, Austudy payments were reduced by $1. However, if there were two or more children eligible to receive Austudy, that $1 was allowed to be spread among the children. With the change contained in these regulations which I am seeking to disallow, the reduction in Austudy is applied to each eligible child.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reason I have put forward this particular matter of public importance&mdash;the failure of the Keating One Nation statement to provide for adequate action to reduce unemployment&mdash;is the total disregard that the Government has displayed towards the magnitude of the crisis that one million unemployed people in Australia represents. Not only has the Government disregarded the magnitude of the crisis but it has also disregarded the social consequences that will arise from such an extraordinary number of people being out of work. Yet, in his One Nation statement, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) provided a total of only $2.3 billion public expenditure, despite the generally acknowledged principle that increased public expenditure is one of the quickest ways to increase jobs, to increase work opportunities. All $2.3 billion will achieve is 35,000 jobs; and this is in the face of one million jobless.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another emergency measure which would show quick results, a pause in tariff cuts, was rejected very clearly, very quickly and almost joyously by the Prime Minister in his statement. Indeed, this has been the position of the Government from the word go. The Government has always maintained that we must reduce tariffs. It has put forward a program to reduce those tariffs and it has made it very clear that it is not going to depart from that program of tariff reductions, no matter what the consequences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am a little at a loss to work out how a number of media commentators, or should I perhaps say subeditors, were able to say last week that the Prime Minister had performed a back flip. He had done nothing of the sort. When we read the statements that the Prime Minister has put down and the statements that other Ministers have confirmed, it is quite clear that this Government is intent on continuing its program of tariff cuts, no matter what it does to our manufacturing industries. It is destroying what is left of the Australian manufacturing base. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no consolation that the Prime Minister was right when he said that the Liberal Party would do worse. Its policy is a scorched earth policy. It would have no pump-priming. It would have substantial spending cuts in community services and tighter monetary policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The magnitude of the problem can hardly be overstated. Between January 1990 and January 1992, unemployment almost doubled from 550,400 to 960,000&mdash;that is, almost one million people. In fact, unemployment is almost certain to be above even that figure because many people have given up looking for jobs. But perhaps it is worse when we consider how long people have been out of work. The number of people who have been out of work for one year or more almost trebled in the same period, from 115,900 to 274,200. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can do no better than to quote Mr John Phillips, deputy governor of the Reserve Bank, who, in turn, was been quoted by Tim Colebatch in his excellent article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 20 March 1992:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that the rising level of structural, or underlying, unemployment is the most worrying long-term problem facing government in Australia. . . Low inflation will be a necessary, though not sufficient, precondition for dealing with that problem. Many areas of policy are involved and some further lateral thinking may also be needed.</PARA>
<PARA>When I read some time ago that youth unemployment had reached 30 per cent in many areas, I was reminded of another statistic. When Hitler succeeded in his bid for power in Germany in the early 1930s, some 30 per cent of German youth between the ages of 18 and 25 had never had a job. I am not suggesting that we are on the brink of a fascist society, but we might note that last year there was an increase of 10 per cent in our prison population, and we might also note that we are now in a much worse position. We now have in the north-west region of Melbourne&mdash;and Wills is located in that region&mdash;50.6 per cent youth unemployment; more than half of the young people in that region in Wills are out of a job. The overall jobless rate in that region is 19 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Take away people's self-sufficiency and one takes away their self-esteem, their purpose in life and their future. One  replaces them with political extremes, racism, increased crime rates, family breakdown and domestic violence&mdash;and this will be so whether we become a republic or remain a constitutional monarchy. It is in this context that we must view the Prime Minister's One Nation statement and the Hewson tax package with its callous disregard for people without work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also in this context that the Senate needs to consider the Prime Minister's point-blank refusal, as I have outlined before, to stop further cuts in tariffs, cuts which will continue to destroy what is left of Australia's manufacturing industry, much of which is concentrated in Victoria. Much of it&mdash;and it is perhaps ironic that this is where we are to have the by-election&mdash;is concentrated in the electorate of Wills where a very high proportion of industry is in textiles, clothing and footwear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year, 18 factories closed in the Wills electorate. Six hundred jobs were lost, and a further 2,000 jobs are at risk. However, the problem is greater. A statement by the TCF Council released on 30 January 1992 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">-total TCF gross product has fallen by 7% and 12% respectively over the last two years.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a total of 19 per cent. The statement continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">-official figures show that total TCF employment has fallen by 5% in the last two years and in the more vulnerable, labour intensive clothing and footwear sector employment has declined by 15%.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">-however, the official data understates the full impact of the decline with an estimated 40% of the industry operating shorter than normal work time (eg. 3 or 4 day weeks, limited overtime, etc).</PARA>
<PARA>In one sense, the TCF Council, in its statement on 27 February, welcomes the Government's $51m provided in the Prime Minister's statement, but it also says that although this will be of help to restructure the economy in the long term, it will do nothing to provide jobs for those people who need them right now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pause in tariff reductions is not the only measure missing in the Keating package. The tax on employment&mdash;payroll tax&mdash;remains; superannuation funds are free to invest overseas to create jobs off-shore; and there is to be no further reduction in the interest rate. Clearly, we cannot depend just on our domestic market. To revive our economy and generate jobs, we must boost our export performance and cut imports. Here Mr Keating offers an increase in Austrade activities, some marginal improvement in export finance arrangements and the Australian Technology Group to develop Australian inventions. Does he really think that a one-off capital base of $30m will be enough? Does it go anywhere near enough to gearing up our industry in Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other nations are not afraid to protect their jobs. The United States uses protective tariffs for a large range of industrial products, including ball-bearings and computers, and its subsidies for primary products are legendary. In 1990, primary producers in the United States and the European Community countries were paid subsidies equal to 44 per cent of farm output. Both the United States and the European Community have made it clear that they are unlikely to accept Mr Dunkel's GATT proposals to reduce their farm subsidies. Even if they did, it would be only a partial phase-out over several years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to take decisive action to reduce imports. We must place a 10 per cent tariff on luxury goods, more extensive import quotas, tougher and faster anti-dumping procedures and expansion of the export credit used in the car industry plan to tie imports to the level of exports. Dumping measures require particular attention. We now have a process that lasts almost a year and which burdens people who are being ruined by cheap imports with the substantial cost of providing evidence, not only that they are being hurt, but also that the dumping of cheap products is what actually does the damage. The onus should be placed on the importer to show that a product at a cost below the price on the domestic market is not being dumped in Australia. Clearly, the evidence that this is harming the Australian industry will be there for all to see. It can be seen in the figures I have quoted today which were provided by the TCF Council and other industry sectors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To boost exports, we need a pause in tariff cuts, as previously stated; but, even more importantly, we need targeted measures to assist specific industry sectors with export potential. The accelerated depreciation provisions should have been targeted in this way, as should funding for research and development. The CSIRO missed out totally in Mr Keating's statement, and tax deductibility for research and development will be reduced from 150 per cent to 125 per cent, while our national expenditure continues at less than half of what is spent by other nations such as Japan, Germany and the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our neglect shows. Last year our manufactured exports increased by 56 per cent&mdash;in itself a pleasing figure, but not when one compares it with 91.9 per cent for Japan, 82.8 per cent for the United States, and 140.4 per cent for Germany.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia will not be able to provide jobs for its citizens within a sustainable economy framework unless it can compete in international markets. We will not be able to do so unless we first put an end to further job losses and preserve what is left of our manufacturing base, and then proceed to build up our capacity in selected industry sectors&mdash;in other words, where investment and incentives will provide real returns. The second strand is to unlock new markets for our primary products and to challenge the restrictive barriers and subsidies now in place. To achieve these goals, our Government has to stop relying on so-called free markets manipulated by others and instead provide economic leadership on a goal-directed and targeted basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the evidence before us so far, one would have to say that the outlook for a change in government policy is unlikely. One would have to say that the alternative would be worse. So what is the future that we are facing?  Once again, the electorate of Wills provides an instructive lesson. It is now well and truly on the public record that the Australian Democrats are running there on a policy of interventionist economic strategies&mdash;on tariffs, but also on targeted assistance to industry. It is also clear that the Independent candidate, Mr Cleary, is running on a similar policy. In fact, he has exchanged preferences with the Australian Democrats precisely on that basis: that we need a change in economic direction if we are not to go down the drain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This exchange of preferences is not the beginning; it is the continuation of a process that started some time ago. As long ago as the middle of last year, a number of organisations&mdash;the Australian Democrats, several unions, the Rainbow Alliance, some Green groups, the New Left Party&mdash;got together on the basis that something must be done, that an alternative must be developed, that we cannot continue this disastrous slide on which the Government has put us and down which the Opposition would push us even further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It might be instructive if I quote from a statement that was released in Melbourne in December 1991. The statement says&mdash;and all these organisations, including the unions, have agreed to it&mdash;that the urgent measures that we require to get our economy up and running again, to provide jobs  and to stop the social destruction that we are facing are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. Substantial increases in public sector expenditure at State and Commonwealth level</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. Selective incentives to assist key industry sectors with potential for import replacement and for exports</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. Extensive measures aimed at a substantial reduction of imports, including tariffs, quotas, quality controls, effective anti-dumping measures, tax incentives and penalties</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. Measures to boost savings and domestic capital, including tax incentives for savings placed in a Development Fund and requirements on Superannuation Funds to invest in Australian public utilities and other socially desirable projects</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5. Substantially increased expenditure on research, education and training.</PARA>
<PARA>And so it goes on. It is important to draw parallels with New Zealand, where an alternative alliance has obtained figures between 30 per cent and 40 per cent, and with Canada, where a similar alliance, which rejects the slavish adherence to free markets, has achieved similar results. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for this reason that the by-election in Wills will be a milestone in Australian political history and in the way in which we run our economy.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The failure of the Keating One Nation statement to provide for adequate action to reduce unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA>What was totally lacking from the contribution by Senator Spindler, of course, was an indication of an understanding of the complexity of the task facing Australia. I do not doubt that there were some motives of a humanitarian kind in his contribution. But the question of unemployment will not be solved by preserving the tariff walls, for example, which have created a situation where Australian industry has been unable to be so modernised and transformed that it can sell products on the world market, which the world market wishes to purchase and, in purchasing, sustains Australians in employment in those industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This problem of unemployment will certainly not be solved by a Democrats Cabinet&mdash;God forbid&mdash;sitting in isolation in Canberra, pandering to groups as they emerge during particular political campaigns, and deciding which industries should be targeted in order to receive government largesse. It would be even worse if the Democrats, instead of trustees of superannuation funds, were to decide where to direct the savings of Australians, which are so incredibly important not only for this nation, but also, speaking individually, for the future retirement incomes of so many of those Australians. To replace trustees, who are under a fiduciary duty to use those funds in a way which aids those who have made contributions to superannuation, with the Democrats deciding that it should go into this industry or that industry or here rather than there, is totally unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Spindler tried to portray the matter as if one should seek to avoid extremes. On the tariff question, the Democrats are somewhat caught out because it is quite clear where the extremes lie in this debate. I have already mentioned Senator Spindler's extreme, that of wishing to preserve the tariff walls. One then has the extreme of the Opposition parties&mdash;or at least the Liberal Party leading the National Party in this regard&mdash;wishing to go to zero tariffs by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But our approach is a middle one&mdash;a phased approach, which therefore has that humane touch, which I know Senator Spindler is seeking, and which moderates the very dry economics which would say that one has to move across the whole range of Australian industry to zero tariffs by the year 2000. Senator Spindler would know that in relation to the very industries he mentioned, such as the textiles, clothing and footwear and motor vehicle industries, that is not our objective. There will be a phasing out but not a complete abolition of tariffs in that regard. </PARA>

That is to do with the difficulty of enforcing compliance with the award which governs the pastoral industry. It is alleged that New Zealanders are coming across and taking the jobs of shearers and displacing them. One has good, hard-working Australians unable to get employment in the shearing profession which they have been following, probably in their fathers' footsteps.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that situation, one has a terribly complex situation in relation to unemployment. Senator Spindler does not seem to be able to do anything more than mouth some platitudes about tariff walls, directing superannuation and so on. To say that the One Nation statement does not do anything to deal with the problem of unemployment, is absolutely extraordinary; it is breathtaking in its ignorance of the features of that package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, it is a matter of small things; it is a matter of large things, and I will come to those. But let us take that small expenditure by every family with children which will be enhanced by government action to boost the family allowance this very week. That, together with family assistance supplement increases, will put $557m into the hands of Australian families. This week alone hundreds of millions of dollars, some $317m, will be paid as a one-off bonus to Australian families. That will flow immediately into the local stores, into the retail sector, as those families make purchases. That will help sustain and increase employment in those retail sectors which have been extremely hard hit, as we know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is an example of saying to the households of Australia, the families of Australia, that it is not for governments, it is not for the Democrats, to decide where money should be put in order to boost employment.

All these improvements in roads, rail, port infrastructure, are vital not only to Australia's sustainable future but also to the creation of employment in the meantime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the creation of employment in the meantime is extremely important and a matter which was very much the focus of the One Nation statement, but not in a way which simply created jobs and left Australia without that infrastructure which will support jobs not only for the rest of this decade but also into the next century of our development as a democratic nation with a market economy with some government intervention. That is the way we want to go and that is the way in which the One Nation statement helps provide the base for infrastructure, transport in particular, which will lift our growth capacity; and I believe that has to be acknowledged. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Powell mentioned the GST. I think it is very timely that she has raised that in the course of this debate; I was not going to. But since she has, it is well worth noting that it is claimed in the Fightback statement of the Opposition, led by Dr Hewson, and in the propaganda that over the last week has gone into every postbox and every household around Australia, that under the Fightback package some two million jobs will be created over a period. In all the documentation that surrounds that Fightback package, one finds one very interesting fact: there is no mention of the GST in respect of the two million jobs that are sought to be portrayed as being able to be created as a result of implementing this package. It is not in the model and it does not figure in the calculation that led to that figure of two million jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Powell might say, `Senator Tate, why should we take your line on this?'. I might mention Gerard Henderson, who is certainly not an ideological bedfellow of the Australian Labor Party. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 10 December last year he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For Hewson and company this is just as well. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> makes it clear that the promise of "2 million soundly based jobs" and an unemployment level of "5.2 per cent by the year 2000" is based on Scenario C.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to analyse scenario C and comes to this conclusion:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, the firm warranty that some 2 million jobs "will" be created and unemployment halved by the end of the century is just a guess. Well meaning, no doubt. Yet a hypothesis just the same. What is more, the AEM model on which this overtly optimistic promise is based does not take into account the inflationary impact of the Coalition's across-the-board goods and services tax (GST). It is all pie in the sky.</PARA>
<PARA>So what we have had, unfortunately, placed in every letterbox throughout Australia over the last week is a hoax&mdash;nothing less than a hoax on the Australian people. The two million job figure has no relationship whatsoever to the inflationary impact of the goods and services tax on the Australian economy and our whole social life, whether one is talking about the tourism sector, which is a matter of great interest to my friend and Tasmanian colleague, Senator Nick Sherry&mdash;</PARA>

I note that some people in the public gallery are from north-west Tasmania, the home port of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Abel Tasman</EMPHASIS>. They would know that some $390m is brought into the Tasmanian economy every year from the mainland and overseas by way of tourism expenditure. If we add 15 per cent to the cost of coming across Bass Strait by air or by sea and 15 per cent to accommodation, meals and travelling around, there will be a very big question mark over whether people will continue to regard Tasmania as a desirable tourist destination. That must have an impact on the 16,000 people employed in the tourism industry in Tasmania. That comment can be duplicated, triplicated and quadruplicated around Australia in the various areas that are dependent on tourism for sustaining their economic growth and employing their children.</PARA></TALK.START>

Whereas the Labor Party looks at the problem of employment and asks, `How can we create employment by creating wealth?', I believe the Liberal Party looks at the problem and asks, `How can we create wealth?' and if employment follows as a consequential effect, that is good.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key thing behind this matter of public importance is that the man who created the crisis&mdash;the man who misled the Australian people about how everything was on track and that there would be no recession; this man who deliberately distorted figures to make them appear to be a wonderful set of numbers; this man who dragged Australia unnecessarily into this disastrous recession&mdash;now claims some sort of right to lead us out of the disaster he himself created.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is once again simply trying to buy its way out of trouble and back into government with other people's money. Some of that money that is being thrown around in the One Nation package is to be borrowed from foreigners again. We have already seen how much this Government has forced Australia into debt by creating the jobs it created for a while during its recovery program from the previous recession. We have seen the enormous cost to Australia's foreign debt involved in this Government's crazy proposals which inevitably failed in the long run. Not only is it going to borrow more from overseas to do it, it is going to rip some more off taxpayers. If we compare that with the 30 per cent across-the-board tax cuts under Fightback, we will see that there is an enormous difference between the way the Democrats and the Australian Labor Party want to cure this cancer that is in our economy and the way we want to really fix it once and for all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> When we listen to Senator Tate, we find it funny how Labor members magically omit from every discussion about the Fightback package anything that is clearly of huge benefit.

I cannot believe that Senator Tate would be so unscrupulous as deliberately to ignore that when he makes an analysis of Fightback. He must have just forgotten it because he certainly did not mention it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me incredible that a man of Senator Tate's standing would come into this place and say that the only thing the coalition is going to do is introduce a goods and services tax which will be inflationary, when he knows that not to be so. He knows that the goods and services tax will have a minute impact on inflation which will not be continuing. In fact, there will be no need to compensate workers for the higher costs of GST because they will get a huge tax cut. That is exactly the same technique that this Government has used of offsetting increases in costs of living with tax cuts instead of higher wages. It is a principle the Labor Party accepts when it chooses to do so but not, of course, at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us recognise this: the real measure of compassion is how we fix the basic problems that are affecting those people in need.

But without structural change, without that money being funded, the One Nation package is a guarantee of continuing disaster. It provides absolutely no hope for Australia, whereas the Opposition's Fightback package is full of genuine structural reform aimed at rebuilding Australia. There is nothing in the Government's program, except for some unfunded capital works, which will basically and structurally correct the cancer eating away at Australia's economic health. It is that cancer which is creating this terrible level of unemployment. </PARA>

The young people of Australia are carrying the major burden of this Government's disgraceful and dishonourable policies, yet we see Ministers in this Government pretending that there is really no problem for young Australians and that the real unemployment rate for young Australians is 8.8 per cent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For youth&mdash;that is, people aged 15 to 19&mdash;40 per cent of all the full time jobs that existed two years ago have been wiped out in Australia. Two out of every five full time jobs held by young people in Australia have been wiped out. That means the loss of 183,000 jobs. Despite that loss of 183,000 jobs, there has been an increase of only something like 63,000 in the number of 15- to 19-year-olds who are listed as unemployed. In other words, more than 100,000 young people appear to have disappeared from the figures. This indicates that there is a massive level of hidden unemployment on top of these disastrous figures. As my Leader, John Hewson, said in the House of Representatives, behind these figures there are other disastrous realities. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are 262,000 families in which the chief breadwinner is unemployed, which is up 40 per cent in just the last year. There are 218,000 Australian children living in a family in which no-one has a job, which is up 40 per cent in the last year. There are 248,000 Australians that have been unemployed for more than a year, which is an 88 per cent increase in just the last 12 months. There are 500,000 children living in poverty&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>we were told by the former Prime Minister, of course, that no child would be living in poverty in Australia&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and 75,000 homeless&mdash;and an extra 140,000 families a year have been plunged into extended poverty because of this recession.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Youth unemployment in Australia is around 30 per cent, but in some of the regional areas outside Sydney and Melbourne it is as high as 40 or 50 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>It is certainly around that level in my area of Wollongong. Dr Hewson continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are 60,000 young Australians who could not get into university this year and nearly 100,000 young Australians who could not get into TAFE or technical colleges.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the legacy of Mr Keating, the man who promised that there would be no recession and then gave us the recession we had to have; the man who said that it was an engineered recession. He takes the credit for it. The reality of all of these figures is that something positive has to be done. Not only are the figures disastrous, but also the level of hidden unemployment is disastrous. There are something like three quarters of a million hidden unemployed in Australia and there are almost half a million under-employed, as I indicated from those earlier figures. When those figures are taken together, they lift the number of Australians who are either unemployed or under-employed, all of whom want work or more work, to something like one in every four Australians. It is an horrendous and appalling figure for which this Government has no answer, for which the Democrats only want to give bandaids of handouts of government money. There is no attempt by the Government to have a basic structural correction of this disaster. Instead, it will be throwing money at the problem, which it will borrow from foreigners or rip off taxpayers, without solving one basic thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know perfectly well that throwing money at the problem is not the solution. One of the former top men of the Treasury, Dr David Morgan&mdash;who has now gone to Westpac&mdash;has said exactly that. It must be very embarrassing to the Government to know what Dr Morgan is saying. In a recent Westpac publication he dramatised the difference between the 1982-83 recession, which he said was a combination of external and domestic factors, and the 1990-91 recession, which he said was purely domestic. Dr Morgan said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main catalyst for the 1990-91 recession in Australia was the Government's imposition of high interest rates aimed at curbing rapid growth in domestic spending (primary business investment).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But the seeds had been sown by the Hawke Government's mishandling of the recovery from the 1982-83 recession as most of the gains in reducing inflation during the recession were lost in an over-rapid recovery.</PARA>
<PARA>That comes from one of the Government's former major advisers who also just happens to be married to a Government Minister, Ros Kelly. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This laid the groundwork for the spending boom, high inflation and large balance of payments problem of the late 1980s so that `another recession, this time due only to national problems, became inevitable'. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what Dr Morgan says. What is this Government doing? It is doing exactly the same thing. It is just incredible. It has learnt nothing. It will do nothing that is aimed at correcting the basic problems. Instead, it is leading us into exactly the same sort of disaster that it led us into after the last recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We, on the other hand, have a clear policy which does create jobs.

We will get rid of seven taxes that are hitting industry. We will create a situation where the Government is off the backs of Australians. We will get rid of the pressures that the Government has imposed on the business sector which limit its capacity to expand and which restrain it from employing people.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter of public importance which has been placed before the Senate today by the Australian Democrats, the failure of the Keating One Nation statement to provide for adequate action to reduce unemployment, is a very important debate. Prime Minister Keating's One Nation statement was supposed to be about jobs but, despite a bit of window dressing and some rather obvious bribery, One Nation does very little for those already unemployed and those Australians living on low incomes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Tate did not much like the analysis put forward by Senator Spindler in the first instance on behalf of the Democrats, so I will give him a couple of other opinions.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government needed a much bolder, bigger package than this to fulfil its responsibility to the unemployed. It allowed itself to be fenced in by the expectations of the financial markets.</PARA>
<PARA>Kenneth Davidson, economics editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, in his comment following the release of One Nation gave the statement a `Good' in his somewhat school-report-style article. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But it seems to me that in a situation in which the economy is running at about $20 billion a year below capacity, one of the biggest contributions to improving economic efficiency would be to place first priority on getting as many unemployed working as possible.</PARA>
<PARA>I thought Senator Tate would like to have a couple of further opinions, Basically, the Government has failed to seize the moment and do what is most desperately needed&mdash;create employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One Nation reflects a government that has resigned itself to a high long term unemployment level. The statement predicts unemployment falling to 7.5 per cent in 1995-96. When put up against the Fightback opposition figure of 8.2 per cent by 1996, unemployed Australians are surely entitled to ask, `Where do we fit into either of these so-called grand visions for the future?'. The fact of the matter is that both the Government's and the Opposition's packages blatantly consign at least 700,000 Australian workers to the unemployment scrap heap. Is it any wonder that voters in next week's Wills by-election are turning away from the two major parties as they realise what a bleak future is being served up to them and to their children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us be very clear what we are talking about when we discuss employment statistics and percentages. We are talking about the lives of 700,000 Australians&mdash;their lives and the lives of the people who depend on their incomes. They are being disregarded and callously brushed aside as the necessary economic fallout of the recession we had to have. Senator Baume, in his contribution to this debate this past 15 minutes, has talked about unemployment as a cancer in the Australian economy. I would much prefer to hear Senator Baume or anyone else referring to that as a cancer in the Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is this aspect of One Nation that the Democrats find most abhorrent: the willingness of the Government to accept that 700,000 or more Australian workers and their families will bear the brunt of the so-called economic reform. This is the human face of the recession. This is what the Government and its advisers do not seem to want to see or hear. They do not seem to want their consciences ruffled by the countless stories of misery and heartache engendered by unemployment. They, it seems, want to continue to see unemployment as a neat little economic and statistical dilemma&mdash;`the problem of the hour' as ANU professor of economics Ross Garnaut dismissed it two weeks ago. Professor Garnaut is the proponent of drastic tariff cuts&mdash;an annoying diversion from the main game. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tim Colebatch, one of the few journalists who is taking an interest in what lies behind the statistics, observed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> last Friday, March 20, that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The media seems bored by unemployment, avidly reporting the views of 25 year olds in the financial markets while largely ignoring the devastating consequences these policies have on hundreds of thousands of Australians. Many economists are no better: weary of trying to line up the four goals of economics&mdash;high growth, high employment, low inflation and a balanced current account&mdash;they have decided that only inflation and the current account matter, and growth and employment are dangerous distractions.</PARA>
<PARA>Unemployment is far from being just a distraction. It is the major long term economic and social problem facing this country. In the past two years the numbers of Australian unemployed for nine months or more has risen by more than 200,000. In a little under 20 years we have seen the number of Australians who have been out of work for six months or more go from 6,200 to 443,200. It is still rising by 15,000 people a month. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To accept these high levels of unemployment is to ignore two very fundamental issues. Firstly, it ignores the suffering behind the statistics and, secondly, the many hidden and increasingly not-so-hidden costs of unemployment. Welfare agencies throughout the country&mdash;not lobbyists here in Canberra as the accusation has been made of the Democrats earlier in the debate&mdash;tell of the helplessness and despair associated with unemployment: of family breakdowns, suicide, children going hungry; of longer and longer queues for emergency relief and food packages; of homeless families; of young unemployed people turning to crime and drugs; and the increasing sense of alienation and exclusion from society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have never carried out proper accounting of the cost to our society of continuing to tolerate long term unemployment&mdash;not just the cost in human equality and dignity, not just the cost to welfare budgets of the State and Federal governments, but the additional costs incurred by our police forces, prisons, hospitals, drug clinics, schools and so on. The predicament faced by our young people, for example, is reflected in alarming statistics on teenage suicide, youth homelessness and juvenile crime. Here is the clear evidence of the costs on the other side of the ledger. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the costs to the country of the waste of talents of those people? What about the costs of juvenile crime estimated at $1.5 billion a year, or the cost of adolescent suicide estimated at $100m a year? Mr Keating and Dr Hewson, in all their posturing in the Wills by-election, need to bear in mind that, in that northern region of Melbourne, the majority&mdash;over 50 per cent&mdash;of those young people are out of work. It is time that both Government and Opposition acknowledged the costs on the other side of the ledger. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wider community is coming to realise that we need to spend money to save it. Are we going to refuse to pay, knowing that we will have to pay much more in the future? Are we going to refuse to pay now, knowing that the costs are not just measured in dollars but also in the dismal futures we are passing on to our children?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should note again that if there is an upturn&mdash;and this is looking longish term&mdash;in employment, it is areas such as those surrounding Wills and the northern region of Melbourne that will be among the last to reap the benefits. I think that we can look to the year 2000 for any relief for those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one million Australians are to be scapegoats for our economic woes, the Government should at least ensure that those people have sufficient incomes to live on. In reality, that is not occurring. In fact, we have seen a series of measures over the last two years, strongly supported by the Opposition, that have quite clearly penalised or disadvantaged people who are out of work through no fault of their own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although there have been some gains in the area of improved access to training programs, the Government has basically been engaged in cost cutting, tarted up as an active employment strategy. We have seen young unemployed people's incomes reduced. At the height of the recession, we saw social security waiting periods lengthened, forcing people to wait even longer for that income support. A new liquid assets test was introduced, forcing people to use up their meagre savings before they can receive any assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen the Newstart scheme introduced, with its draconian approach to the unemployed. This scheme signalled that the Government was intent upon undermining the principle of unemployment benefit as an entitlement and a compensation payment for the inability of the labour market to provide adequate income through employment. That principle of income support as a right is an important one and one in which the Australian Democrats believe very strongly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has missed many opportunities with its One Nation statement. It could have increased the amount that people on pensions and benefits are permitted to earn before losing their entitlement to payment; it could have reinstated young unemployed people's incomes back to adult levels; it could have stopped penalising unemployed people for doing voluntary work; and it could have reduced or removed all existing waiting periods for income support, which are responsible currently for much poverty in this country, especially among families.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The failure of the Keating One Nation statement to provide for adequate action to reduce unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA>Firstly, I will respond to some of Senator Powell's comments. Frankly, I do not need to be reminded of the effects of unemployment. My father went through the Great Depression of the 1920s and 1930s. When I was a child, he recounted to me fairly regularly the effects of that Depression. This is not an uncaring Government or, for that matter, an uncaring Opposition. I believe that every person in this place, although our approaches, policies and philosophies may be different, genuinely does care but perhaps has a different attitude from the Australian Democrats.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Later in this contribution to the debate I will be making further comments about the economic approach of the Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS> document tabled by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) contains a wide range of initiatives.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also think it is a bit ludicrous of the Democrats to be moving this motion at this time.

In terms of Budget deficits, some criticism has been made by the Opposition that we are borrowing money and using other people's money to pay for the Budget deficit to fund much of what is contained in the One Nation package. All I can say to that is: so what? This Government has run a surplus in government expenditure for most of the years it has been in office. That is to its credit, because that was an appropriate policy at that time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The One Nation statement proposes to increase the deficit by $2.3 billion to $6.8 billion. That is a quite substantial and responsible fiscal stimulus to the economy. We reject the comments made by those opposite that it is inappropriate to have a substantial Budget deficit at this time. We have run a surplus over much of this Government's period in office, when we had a much lower rate of unemployment, and we are now running a significant deficit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would draw the line with the Democrats on the size of that deficit. I am not sure what they are proposing&mdash;again, I will comment on the Democrats at the end of my contribution&mdash;in terms of a Budget deficit to carry out the sorts of propositions that they have in mind. I am sure that Senator Kemp, looking at the cat-like smile on his face&mdash;while he is chewing something, I note&mdash;will refer to the Democrats' proposed budget that was handed down last year. I am sure that he will be drawing out some of the inconsistencies in the Democrats' approach as I will be at a later date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of education and training and the labour market, there are very significant pronouncements made in the One Nation package. They build on a succession of changes that have been initiated by this Government over the last nine years. It is certainly fair to say that there is criticism of education and training and labour market initiatives in themselves for not solving unemployment straight away. That is certainly a legitimate criticism. But in the longer term of the Australian economy, it is very important that we upgrade the education and training levels of our work force.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A consistent feature of every major OECD nation is that they have very highly trained and educated work forces. The education and training levels of the more successful economies, such as Germany and Japan, which are quite often quoted, are much greater than our own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last nine years this Government has had significant success in this area. The year 12 retention rate increased from 41 per cent to 71 per cent last year. There has been a 50 per cent increase in the number of students attending universities. In the years 1992-94, we will be spending $13 billion in this area. In fact, there has been some criticism that we have been too successful in the university area and have neglected some areas of education and training. The number of university degrees has increased by 43 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I referred earlier to the criticism that is being made about university education. A legitimate criticism which can be made of this Government and the States is that the number of persons studying in the trade area has declined&mdash;the number of trade qualifications has declined by 11 per cent over the last year. I do not believe that is an outcome that we can be pleased with. In the One Nation package the Government has proposed to switch the emphasis from universities to the TAFE sector. It has proposed a quite revolutionary approach; that is, for the States, particularly, to take away the funding and control of the TAFE sector and provide an additional $720m over the next triennium for the TAFE sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has been backed up by two reports specifically commissioned by the Government: the Deveson report, which drew attention to the diverse and responsive training system that is needed; and the Finn review which, amongst a variety of issues, showed that 30 per cent of school leavers who go into the work force have no additional vocational education and training. The One Nation package picks up, in a positive way, on those reports and funds some initiatives to try to resolve these two issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Employment and Skills Formation Council, led by Laurie Carmichael, recently brought down a report. As I understand it, Mr Carmichael will be speaking to a number of parliamentary committees on that report later this week. Also included in the One Nation package is funding for an extra 9,000 apprentice places in 1992; an additional 10,000 traineeship places; and an additional 7,000 places in the apprenticeship system for those most at risk during the current economic recession. Jobstart will attract an extra $100m in funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government can be quite proud of the changes made in the tourism industry over the past eight or nine years and the success that has been achieved. One of the features of the One Nation package is that the Government has targeted, in a positive way, a number of sectors of the economy where there has been and is likely to be significant job growth in the long term. In 1991, 2.4 million visitors came to Australia. There was no growth at all in most countries with comparable economies. In the past eight years there has been a 155 per cent increase in the number of tourists coming to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of export dollars&mdash;and I stress the words `export dollars'&mdash;tourism is worth $7.3 billion to this nation. Tourism is our largest single export, constituting 10 per cent of the total value of our exports. It is worth more than wool, wheat, meat or iron ore. It provided 50,000 new jobs in the past year and it will provide 200,000 new jobs over the next eight years, as the Democrats would have learnt from the answer given in response to the question asked by Senator Sowada during Question Time today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We propose to go further in the area of the tourism industry. A number of initiatives have been outlined in the One Nation package. For example, there will be deregulation in the aviation industry to encourage the continued expansion of that sector that has occurred over the past couple of years. The promotions that have been undertaken over the past eight years by this Federal Government through the Tourism Commission are well known to us and have been very successful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Initiatives contained in the One Nation package include changes to depreciation. The depreciation regime in the short term accommodation area has been improved to 4 per cent a year; it was previously 2 1/2 per cent a year.

The rate of depreciation on very expensive plant and equipment items in the hospitality industry&mdash;such things as furniture, fittings and air-conditioning&mdash;has been significantly improved from 13.5 per cent to 20 per cent.

Can I refresh Senator Cook's memory as to why Mr Keating was the strongest advocate in this country for a goods and services tax? What did he say in 1985? This is the man who Senator Cook supported for Prime Minister; he spent six months undermining Mr Hawke. This is the man Senator Cook supported for Prime Minister, and Mr Keating said then that we needed a consumption tax because it was:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>As a general comment I would like to say that, yet again, I think the Auditor-General has shown he is worth every cent he is being paid as the guardian of taxpayers' money; he has produced an excellent report. By way of background, let me explain that the Department of Administrative Services is now made up generally of a lot of business units. A few years ago it was decided that these quasi-commercial units would be established with type 2 trust accounts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of that process the various business units moved into accrual accounting which, I might say, was well overdue and actually welcomed by the Opposition. This meant that proper balance sheets, profit and loss, notes to accounts and so on were produced. This represented a difficult transition for government departments which were not used to accrual accounting and all the things that come with business enterprises; they were used to government accounting. The Opposition was only too happy to display a degree of patience in the transition because we recognised the difficulties of moving from government accounting to proper financial accounting through the accrual accounting process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, as pointed out in the report, of the six business units the Auditor-General in fact has qualified three. Very important and not often generally recognised is the number and amount of assets owned by the taxpayers and covered by the Department of Administrative Services. The six business units themselves, as pointed out by the Auditor-General, had a total operating revenue of over $1 billion in 1990-91 and assets totalling over $1 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will just speak very briefly on some of the audit findings because, even though the Opposition is happy to display a degree of patience, the report shows the difficulties and&mdash;I suppose I could put it this way&mdash;the lack of regard in the past for the sorts of things that are awfully important when running a business. In fact, I would have to say that if the degree of record management displayed by the departments was carried out in the private sector, not only would those particular business enterprises be in serious financial difficulties, but also, I think more importantly, we would see&mdash;and quite legitimately&mdash;the financial press write very disparaging remarks within its financial pages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just touch on a couple of the points raised. The Australian Property Group provides accommodation services and property owner services to government agencies. In 1990-91 it had total operating revenue of $52.8m and expenses of $44.7m. In a summary of the audit findings, the Auditor-General pointed out the areas requiring managerial attention. One was the need to review and reconcile unissued sales invoices for Commonwealth-owned properties totalling some $3.7m to ensure that debts were recovered or bad debts written off, as appropriate. At any time, but particularly in a time of recession, this would be of utmost importance if these were operating as private sector operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other comments were made with respect to the reconciliation of records of Commonwealth-owned properties to ensure that all rents and outgoings were recovered from tenants; in other words, collecting rent. The Auditor-General talked about improved cash management by prompt allocation of cash receipts, improved credit note controls, more defined debt recovery and so on. There is also substantial criticism of the key computer system, MENTOR, to reduce the risk of incorrect processing of financial information and tighten data input. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things the ANAO found is that the property register contained large amounts of obsolete and incorrect data, especially in relation to the Commonwealth-owned estate. This is a matter that I have raised a number of times in Estimates committees because, again, the Audit Office noted that Australian Estate Management maintained a separate property management register instead of using the MENTOR property register. So we had two arms of DAS using different systems to record property, which is a major asset. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, in the last Estimates Committee hearing, I requested a list of all the properties owned by the Commonwealth Government; subsequently that list was provided to me. But I noticed, for example, that there was a major property&mdash;maybe the list did not include land on which buildings were not built&mdash;in the City of Brisbane which is next door to the Commonwealth Government Offices which was not included on the asset register. This casts some doubts on the validity of the asset register itself and, of course, asset registers are absolutely vital in the operation of any commercial operation. When one has doubts about the asset register provided by the Commonwealth, I believe it to be a very serious matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to the Australian Property Group, the Auditor-General also noted that it issued over 4,600 credit notes totalling $120m in 1990-91, and that there was a control weakness relating to the use, allocation and control of those credit notes. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Audit testing disclosed that credit notes were issued to. . . write off bad debts.</PARA>
<PARA>I expect that this practice will be corrected following the Auditor-General's report. Again, I wish to pay credit to the Auditor-General for drawing attention to these commercial operations. The report suggests that the practice of bad debts being written off in this should cease, and the Department has indicated that it will do so. Once bad debts are written off against sales by using credit notes, the provision for doubtful debts is understated. In proper accrual accounting procedures it is most important to be able to estimate such provision. The report further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The correct classification of properties within the property registers is important to enable the correct calculation of rentals and charges and to help ensure adequate control over properties.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a basic requirement for any organisation and the Auditor-General has drawn attention to this fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter of great concern to me was that the audit found that a number of users were assigned privileged password access to the computer operating system facilities beyond their operational requirements. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This excessive level of access could enable a user to manipulate intentionally or accidentally the MENTOR database without the changes being detected.</PARA>
<PARA>This is another matter that must be addressed by the Department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the Australian Government Publishing Service, which provides printing, publishing and distribution services to the Parliament, as well as advice on those matters. The audit found that there was a need to establish a stock accounting system for passport and related documents. I will enlarge on that in a moment. The audit also found that finished goods holdings need to be analysed to ensure obsolete items are identified and written off where appropriate, and that there should be a timely reconciliation of print brokerage jobs to ensure that sales and associated costs were identified. The concern about passport related documents was that, even though the ANAO building itself is secure, it was found that printing blocks for those documents were not kept in a secure place within the production unit and were readily accessible. This leaves itself open to abuse of the passport system itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to the AGPS, the report further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The audit disclosed that approximately 40% of the total finished goods value related to items dated 1988 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The level of obsolete stock is of great concern. One of the problems in any commercial operation&mdash;whether it be in the private or public sector, but more importantly in the private sector&mdash;is that as time goes by in the commercial operations of organisations such as DAS, if obsolete stock remains on the books it artificially inflates the profit figures. In fact, more than one public company has found itself going down the tube into liquidation because it has maintained on its assets register very high levels of obsolete stock which could not be sold. In addition, in regard to publishing a lot of stock would take up valuable space, which in itself attracts a rental. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General conducted an audit of the Australian Construction Services which is broken up into two discrete groups, Project Services and Asset Services. Project Services provides architectural, engineering, design and construction services, including fitting out and refurbishing government-owned and leased accommodation. Asset Services provides asset-management services, including repairs and maintenance and minor construction works and fitout. In 1990-91 the total operating revenue for the ACS was $582m and total expenses were $593m, representing a loss of $12m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Audit Office conducted a review of procedures and methods used by various ACS State offices to account for construction work in progress. The review found that methods and procedures used did not comply with the requirements of the Australian statement of accounting standards. I make the point that during the transitional period time must be allowed, but that time has now passed. We must look very carefully at the 1991-92 figures to ensure that these transitional problems have now been eliminated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ANAO found that although the ACS made accurate estimates of the revenue it received&mdash;which is important&mdash;the costs were not matched in a manner which took account of the total estimated cost of each project. Again, this supports a concern that I expressed during previous Estimates Committee hearings that many of the charges being made were not based on a cost structure. Any organisation knows that if quotes given to obtain work are not based on a cost structure, it is inevitable that sooner or later the business will be in trouble. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Audit Office noted that while asset registers were maintained in the ACS, they could not be fully relied upon because comprehensive stocktakes had not been undertaken. In other words, no check had been made of assets. This shows the problem of operating under a government accounting system and the benefits of moving towards a proper accrual system based on business principles. The Audit Office made a recommendation that most businesses would take for granted, namely, that there should be some identification numbers to assist in the recording and control of assets. I do not know how any stocktake can be undertaken&mdash;whether it be on fixed assets or whatever&mdash;unless that simple practice is carried out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Surveying and Land Information Group provides government agencies, the general public and the private sector with surveying, geodetic, mapping and land information services. In 1990-91 its total operating expenses were $52m and its total revenue was $44m. I am quoting these figures to show that these organisations are not small businesses. They are large businesses and, in the event of their being unable to operate profitably, the taxpayer must pay. Hence, there is a necessity for these organisations to be run in a proper and businesslike manner. The ANAO commented that AUSLIG had not undertaken a comprehensive stocktake of assets for several years. If my memory serves me correctly, some asset adjustment was made last year, because asset valuations were given at the time of the transfer of assets to these commercial operations which were then found to be too high. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, this raises doubts in our minds&mdash;bearing in mind the accountability of these organisations to the Parliament&mdash;as to how factual is the information provided to us. AUSLIG advised that it will undertake a stocktake and revaluation and that this would be carried out before 30 June. We look forward to seeing that in the estimates during the Budget session. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General made the following simple recommendation concerning the Australian Protective Service:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A base for costing of APS operations needed to be established to facilitate better cost control . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is simple, and is the sort of measure that anyone would expect to find in any business operation. However, because of past practices of government-owned operations, it is difficult to undertake during the transition process. The Australian Protective Service provides guarding, custodial and security services to government departments, and the report stated that in some cases services had been provided in excess of those costed. Again, that is the sort of error that would not be tolerated in the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was also pointed out that with some clients there were no written agreements. So I guess that if there were no written agreements, there was no understanding of what service had to be provided, over what time span, and so on. This, of course, is very important because if, at some time down the track, it is decided that this sort of exercise would be best done by the private sector, one of the more important parts would be to have contracts or written agreements with customers so that one could evaluate the business itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point that is raised&mdash;and it is raised in a few other parts of the Auditor-General's report&mdash;is the need to review the policy of capitalising all asset items over $500 for financial reporting services. The remark is made&mdash;to which I would generally agree, although I still also believe it is important to keep a track of assets&mdash;that for low value items it can lead to the unnecessary capitalising of all assets. That is, again, a practice that is generally frowned on within the private sector, not only from the point of view of inflating the figures, but from the point of view of moving items which are expense items into capitalised items and thus, as I mentioned earlier, unnecessarily inflating the figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final audit was carried out on the transport group and this covers Comcar, Fleet, distribution services and removal services. The summary of the audit findings was that a reconciliation of key accounts and the general ledger was not being undertaken on a regular basis, and the procedures for the recovery of outstanding debts continued to be a problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will pursue that further in another place, but let me just make an overall comment. First of all, the Auditor-General has yet again done an excellent job. It is hoped that he has sufficient resources at his disposal to continue to do this sort of work. But it shows that Government enterprises have all the earmarks of operations where there is not the same incentive to contain costs and maximise revenue as exists within equivalent operations within the private sector. This does not signify in any way any criticism of the individuals within those commercial operations. It shows that the system is at fault because the incentive does not exist to ensure that there is a profit, because there is always a recognition that at the end of the process, if debts are not collected, if a profit is not made, the individual commercial operation can go back happily to the Minister for Finance and seek that money to be funded&mdash;not by the Government, in fact, but by the taxpayer. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill, seeking appropriation of some $204m, is introduced to accommodate special circumstances arising from the Government's Statement on the Economy &amp; Employment last November and the recent One Nation Statement and to ensure continuity of funding for other important Government initiatives. The Bill addresses only 3 items of expenditure&mdash;Labour Market Program Assistance to Jobseekers and Industry, Residential Care for Older People and Child Care Fee Relief&mdash;continuity of which the Government considers can not be jeopardised by the timing of the availability of funds being dependent upon passage of Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1991-92 through the Parliament. To await passage of that Bill in the normal course of events would place severe hardship on many individuals, companies and charitable organisations. This is not the Government's intent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In short, payments for these measures are required in a timeframe which, on the basis of current estimates, cannot be accommodated by the advance to the Minister for Finance whilst awaiting passage of the Additional Estimates. Put another way this Bill principally deals with the timing of payments for these key Government programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In light of the Appropriations being sought in this Bill, an amendment to Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1991-92 has been moved in the House of Representatives in order to remove from that Bill reference to additional appropriations for these programs. The relevant portfolio Program Performance Statements provided in connection with that Bill will be amended to reflect the changed appropriation arrangements. In that regard, by seeking Parliament's agreement to accelerate separately the appropriations required for these three programs, the Government is responding to the urgency of needs that cannot await passage of the other Additional Estimates in the normal course. I recognise that the Senate, through its Estimates Committees, will exercise its customary scrutiny over the range of Government programs in the course of considering Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1991&mdash;92.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I turn now to the specific programs:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">LABOUR MARKET PROGRAM ASSISTANCE TO JOBSEEKERS AND INDUSTRY</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's Labour Market Assistance to Jobseekers and Industry is aimed at assisting the unemployed retain their skills and links with the workforce, which is particularly crucial at the present time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government announced an increase of $71m in the program for  1991-92 in the November Economy and Employment Statement and a further $11m net has been provided in the One Nation Statement. Smaller increases in related programs, totalling $5m, result in a total appropriation now being sought in this Bill of some $87m, which has been removed from Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1991-92 as I noted earlier.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESIDENTIAL CARE FOR OLDER PEOPLE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's Residential Care for Older People program is directed to ensuring that aged and disabled people, who are assessed as being unable to live at home, have available to them residential support and care appropriate to their needs. As part of the program, grants are made to religious, charitable and other organisations to defray the cost of capital works. An amount of $50m is proposed in this Bill, reflecting a faster path to construction for approvals given. An amendment moved to Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1991-92 has removed an equivalent amount from that Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CHILD CARE FEE RELIEF</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's Child Care Program assists families with dependent children to participate in the workforce and the general community, by ensuring child care is affordable for low and middle income families and by improving the supply and quality of child care. As part of the program, fee relief payments are provided quarterly in advance to service providers to defray the costs of child care for low and middle income families.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This program, unlike the majority of initiatives where individual entitlements are met from Standing Appropriations, is currently funded through the Annual Appropriation mechanism. In light of the entitlement nature of the program the Government is considering in the longer term whether to establish a Standing Appropriation for the program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The appropriation sought in this Bill, some $67m, largely reflects an increase in the average amount per place for fee relief since the Budget estimates were derived and a higher than expected number of child care places being available in 1991-92. An amendment moved to Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1991-92 has deleted some $43m originally sought for this program in that Bill. The additional amount of some $24m sought in this Bill reflects updated calculation of the amount required, undertaken since preparation of Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1991-92.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wish to emphasise again that this Bill seeks to provide appropriations for programs to ensure eligible individuals and organisations are not disadvantaged and placed in a position of hardship pending passage of the Additional Estimates Bills. We have brought forward a specific Appropriation Bill rather than proposing an increase in the Advance to the Minister for Finance to fund these programs pending passage of the Additional Estimates. By taking this path the proposed appropriations can be scrutinised by Parliament prospectively.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Appropriation Bill (No. 5) 1991-92 is a Bill that this Government has introduced very suddenly into the Parliament. It came into the House of Representatives last Tuesday or Wednesday. I think it was debated very rapidly through the House of Representatives on Wednesday 25 March, and it is now here before the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill is an extraordinary Bill and it is an unprecedented Bill. It is seeking appropriation of some $204m. In the second reading speech it is said to be required:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to accommodate special circumstances arising from the Government's statement on the economy and employment last November and the recent One Nation statement and to ensure continuity of funding for other important Government initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill seeks funding for three of the Government's programs. First, $87m is required for a labour market program assistance to job seekers and industry. Secondly, $50m is required for residential care for the elderly. Thirdly, $66m is required for child-care relief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The thing that makes this Bill unprecedented is the fact that the three items for which appropriation is being sought are already included in the Additional Estimates Bills&mdash;the additional Appropriations Bills or Additional Estimates Bills as they are called&mdash;currently before the Senate: Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1991-92 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1991-92. Those Bills, as we are all aware, are being subjected to the normal Additional Estimates processes in the sense that they are being considered by the six Estimates Committees of the Senate, and that process is proceeding in the normal way. The Government is proposing to amend Appropriation Bills Nos. 3 and 4 to withdraw from them the three items that are now to be included in Appropriation Bill (No. 5). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's explanation as to why this unprecedented action is being taken is that there is insufficient money in the Advance to the Minister for Finance to meet the spending requirements for these programs over the next few weeks in the event of there being a delay in the processing through the Parliament of Appropriation Bills Nos 3 and 4. My understanding from the Minister for Finance, when he raised the matter with me before taking his proposals to his Cabinet&mdash;and before consideration of it in the Opposition's shadow Cabinet last week&mdash;was that if there were to be a delay in the Parliament passing Appropriation Bills Nos 3 and 4 beyond 7 May, there was a real risk that the Government could run out of funds to meet those programs, and that therefore this action was being taken to be on the safe side, because they were urgent programs, despite the fact that they are not new programs. As the second reading speech says, two of them arose out of the Government statement on the economy and employment last November, and the third one is one that is included essentially in the One Nation statement introduced by the Government on 26 February and, of course, could have been included, as most of it was, in Appropriation Bills Nos. 3 and 4. So we are not talking about something that suddenly happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument seems to be that, if we get this Appropriation Bill (No. 5) through quickly&mdash;and, as I understand it, the Government is seeking almost to have it through the Senate today&mdash;there is no risk of those programs being starved of funds in the event of the Senate delaying beyond early May the passage of Appropriation Bills Nos 3 and 4. At least, that is my understanding of it from what the Minister for Finance told me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way in which this matter is being handled raises some very important issues. It is only four weeks since Appropriation Bills Nos 3 and 4 were introduced in the normal way into the Parliament. Nothing has happened since then to delay in any way the consideration by the Parliament of those Bills. They moved through the House of Representatives in due process, they came to the Senate in due process and they are being considered by the Estimates committees in due process. There has been no delay in any of that consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the first question that arises is: why, if there is the need now for Appropriation Bill (No. 5), was that need not foreseen just four weeks ago when Appropriation Bills Nos 3 and 4 were introduced? What has happened since then to cause what appears to be, if the Government's actions are anything to judge by, a sudden crisis in funding&mdash;the Government running out of money to fund three of its important programs?<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No explanation has been given to the Senate, and it was not given to the House of Representatives, as to why this was the case. At the very least it is incumbent on the Government to tell us why it has been required to take this&mdash;I repeat&mdash;unprecedented action. Never before, as I am aware or as I am advised, has the Parliament passed an additional Appropriation Bill which comprises material already in other additional Appropriation Bills currently the subject of consideration in the Senate. So the Government must provide an answer to that question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would appear, on the face of it, that the Government is, at the very least, guilty of gross incompetence and financial bungling in its preparation of Appropriation Bills Nos 3 and 4. If it is not, then why did it include these programs in Appropriation Bills Nos 3 and 4? It knew the timetable and the sequence under which they would be considered. Nothing has happened to change that timetable or that sequence. If those programs were included then, and now the Government finds it needs a special Appropriation Bill, prima facie, one would have to say that there has been a bungle&mdash;of a management or financial administration nature, at least&mdash;on the Government's part, and the Government needs to answer that question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next question that arises is: how is it that the Government could find $317m for a one-off bribe to voters nine days before the Wills by-election on 11 April, to pay a one-off family allowance payment to try to buy votes in the Wills by-election?  The Government found that $317m through a Bill amending the appropriate legislation, and that Bill was passed here on 5 March. How come the Government could get all of that in order for this one-off payment announced in the so-called One Nation statement&mdash;really the `One Nation, One Job' statement, namely, Paul Keating's job&mdash;yet not have the wit to be able to manage the appropriate funding of three ongoing programs that it has had on the books and known about, and which have been there for a lengthy period of time? There is something very funny about what appears to have happened&mdash;not funny ha, ha, but funny strange. The Government does need to tell us why that appearance of strangeness, at the very least, has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not suggesting, because it certainly appears not to be the case, that the Government's requirement to pass Appropriation Bill (No. 5) is in any way related to its need for $317m for Thursday of this week to meet its bribe payment of the family allowance to voters. I am not suggesting that there is a mechanical link. But even if one were not a particularly suspicious person, one would have to ask the reason for the apparent unseemly haste in the requirement to have Appropriation Bill (No. 5) passed this week, when we know that that payment is required to meet the Government's bribe commitment on 2 April. These are some questions that need answering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another question is: even if there is a funding problem over the next few weeks in relation to the three programs that are the subject of Appropriation Bill (No. 5), why may they not be met? We are only talking about a three-week delay, or thereabouts, at most; a delay which should not really be considered a delay because it is something that the Government has known about all the time. Why not meet those payment requirements over the next few weeks, if such need arises at all, from the Advance to the Minister for Finance?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government says, as I understand it, that there is no money in the Advance to the Minister for Finance to meet that expenditure. That is a pretty strange thing anyway. Why is it that the Advance to the Minister for Finance, at this time of the year, is so bereft of funds that it could not meet the expenditure on these programs over a very short number of weeks? We are not talking about money to fund programs until 30 June. We are talking, according to the Government, of finding money to pay for programs between now and, say, early May. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two questions: firstly, if there is no money in the Advance to the Minister for Finance, why not? Secondly, how is it that the Minister and the Government have told the Parliament that there is no money, when my staff were advised by the Department of Finance at 4 o'clock last Friday that the current unused balance in the Advance to the Minister for Finance, so far as Appropriation Bill (No. 1) is concerned, for which there is an appropriated amount of $170m, is $92.4m? So far as the Advance to the Minister for Finance in relation to Appropriation Bill (No. 2) is concerned, for which the appropriated amount is $140m, I am told that there is a current balance of $128.2m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If those figures from the Department of Finance are correct, it makes even more strange and, quite frankly, incomprehensible the actions of the Government in bringing in this unprecedented Appropriation Bill (No. 5). If the figures and the advice I have been given are wrong, then it is incumbent on the Government and the Minister to tell us whether those figures are wrong. If the situation as I have portrayed it today is not the case, then we need some answers. If the situation as I have portrayed it today is the case, there would appear to be no valid reason for the Government having taken this unprecedented action of introducing Appropriation Bill (No. 5). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is because of those factors and concerns of the Opposition that I will be moving a second reading amendment to Appropriation Bill (No. 5). The amendment is still being processed, but it would be along these lines: whilst not opposing the Bill, the Senate, firstly, condemns the Government for its incompetence in not recognising the crisis it was facing in funding these programs; secondly, condemns the Government for being able to make a one-off bribe payment of $317m prior to the Wills by-election, whilst at the same time claiming not to have the $204m of funds to fund established programs; and, thirdly, refers the Bill to Senate Estimates Committees B, C, E and F&mdash;I think they are the relevant Estimates committees&mdash;for their consideration of the items contained in Appropriation Bill (No. 5) and for report on those items to the Senate on our first day of sitting after the forthcoming three-week break, namely, 28 April. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the Opposition that amendment seems to be perfectly reasonable because those items that are the subject of Appropriation Bill (No. 5) are already contained in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4), which are being considered by those very Senate Estimates committees at the moment. Therefore, it would make sense to follow the same Senate Estimates committee procedures on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proper thing for an Appropriation Bill of this nature is for it to be considered in Senate Estimates. There have been examples in the past where that has not happened. For example, last year there was a special additional Appropriation Bill to cover the Gulf War and wheat payments associated with the Gulf War at that time. The essential difference between that situation and this situation is that those items were not included in existing additional Appropriation Bills before the Senate. In this case, as I keep saying, they are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are the things that I wanted to say in relation to the Bill itself. I repeat: it is an extraordinary Bill; it is an unprecedented Bill. The coalition thinks that much more explanation of the reasons for this Bill is required before it should be further considered. For that reason, I would hope that when the Minister sums up this second reading debate he will answer those questions. Even if some of the points that I have raised are satisfactorily answered, I would expect that the Senate, if it is really carrying out its parliamentary role properly, would agree to refer the Bill to the appropriate Senate Estimates committees for their consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the Australian Democrats will see the logic of that approach. I hope very much that they will support that referral to the appropriate Estimates committees because, frankly, if we do not, the Senate will be letting down the people of Australia and we will not be undertaking the responsibilities with which we have been entrusted. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst not wanting to debate the content of the Bill in any more detail&mdash;it is a Budget-type Bill, as Appropriation Bills are&mdash;there are some things that one should appropriately say about other matters concerning the state of the economy and matters which are of great concern to us as we continue in the deepest recession that Australia has had in the last 60 years. The Australian community is now looking at the relative merits of the two major sets of competing proposals that have been put up, on the one hand, by the Opposition in its Fightback proposals and, on the other hand, by the Government in its so-called One Nation statement. They are issues of great moment for the future of Australia. They are issues on which the electorate needs to be as well informed as possible so far as their content is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before saying some additional things about the coalition's Fightback package, I wish to pick up a statement that was on the AAP wires today from the National Australia Bank's chief economist, Mr Julian Pierce, concerning the likely future growth of the Australian economy. What Mr Pierce is saying today is absolutely in line with what the coalition has been saying since the release of the Government's economic statement on 26 February. The Senate will recall that the Government's Budget forecasts for the next four years are predicated on the basis of a real rate of growth in the Australian economy of about 4 1/2 per cent for each of the next three to four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has questioned that figure from day one. It seems extraordinarily high. It has rarely been achieved in Australia's history. There were faster rates of growth in the couple of years coming out of the 1983 recession but the circumstances at that time were vastly different from those which now exist. Those differences are such as to provide no basis for comparison or optimism that the growth rates now being forecast for the next three or four years by the Government will be anything like those that were achieved coming out of the last recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is very significant because the Government, even on the basis of very optimistic forecasts for growth in the Australian economy over the next three to four years, sees very little significant decrease in unemployment. Just as importantly, despite the fact that the Government expects a big increase in revenue because, according to it, the economy will be growing so rapidly, at 4 1/2 per cent real for each of the next three or four years, it still forecasts an accumulated Budget deficit over the next four years, including the current financial year, of no less than $20 billion. As the coalition has said on many occasions since the 26 February economic statement by the Government, that is financial irresponsibility in the extreme. It means that the Government will have to go to the financial markets to borrow $20 billion over the next three years to fund that Budget deficit. That will add about 60 per cent to the Government's existing borrowings in the financial market of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inevitable consequence of that is a significant increase in interest rates, and is on the basis of an optimistic economic growth rate. If the economic growth rate is anything like the level forecast today by the National Australia Bank's senior economist&mdash;that is a forecast with which I would be broadly in accord and he may be a little optimistic&mdash;accepting a figure of 2 per cent to 2.5 per cent for the next year, that would mean that the Budget deficit next year will be several billion dollars higher than the $8 billion that has been forecast by the Government. That will occur at a time when, hopefully, there could be some recovery in the Australian economy in terms of the private sector looking for some funds for expansion and new development. Heaven knows we need that. In the last couple of years Australia has had the largest fall on record in new investment in the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the onset of the recession, we have seen Australia's investment base and capital base decimated. Therefore, there is a great need for new investment in Australia, otherwise any recovery in the Australian economy and in demand will simply be met by huge increases in imports. If that happens, we will have yet again another balance of payments crisis on our hands. We desperately need new investment. Therefore, we need to take steps to encourage investment in Australia, and have to do everything we can to avoid investment being frustrated. That will occur if we increase interest rates in the way that will inevitably happen as a result of the Government's fiscal policy. Hence, the Government's economic statement of 26 February  was irresponsible. Everything in that statement is geared to cause a crowding out of private sector investment in Australia right at the time when that investment is hopefully occurring. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats approach the Appropriation Bill (No. 5) 1991-92 with one major object&mdash;that is, not to debate Fightback, One Nation or even the Wills by-election, but to ensure that the Government is legally able to spend the money which will be appropriated by this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The appropriation, as Senator Short has said, covers child-care fee relief arrangements, residential accommodation of aged people and training programs for unemployed people. The Democrats totally support the provision of child-care fee relief to those low income and disadvantaged groups which currently benefit from the existing arrangements. We also support the residential care for older people program which provides money to religious and charitable organisations for the construction of housing to meet the needs of aged and disadvantaged people who cannot live at home. The construction of dwellings under this program is being accelerated to provide employment. We do not argue with that move. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other programs relate to labour market assistance to job seekers and industry which seek to allow the recently unemployed to retain their skills so that we do not suffer a structural skills shortage in the future. Again, who could argue with the aims of these programs? We will not put at risk any of these programs by delaying the passage of this Bill. We just do not think this should be about political point scoring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill is not part of the ordinary budgetary processes. That is why I would like to look at the processes for a moment. There are precedents which I will cite to show that this accelerated appropriation is not unprecedented. The ordinary practice is that the appropriation Bills Nos. 1 and 2 are introduced with the Budget in August and are then passed in the middle of the Budget sittings. In the Autumn sittings, the supplementary appropriation Bills, Nos. 3 and 4, are introduced. These are designed to appropriate funds additional to those of Nos. 1 and 2 to cover unforeseen expenditure and expenditures on new programs not included in the Budget. In addition, appropriation Bills Nos. 3 and 4 are used to replace funds which have been drawn from the Advance to the Minister for Finance. That is a general contingency fund which temporarily finances urgent and unforeseen expenditure until a specific appropriation has been made. Then we have what are known as Supply Bills, which are introduced at the end of the Autumn sittings which merely provide temporary authority from the Parliament for the normal functioning of the Government from 1 July until the first appropriation Bills are passed in November. That is the process. We have to work out where this fits in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been a variety of claims made about this particular appropriation by the Opposition, particularly in the other place. It was said there that this measure is unique and unprecedented. By `this measure' I mean the accelerated urgent appropriation. That is not true. The current format for the presentation of appropriations arose from the parliamentary compact of 1965. We should look at examples from that date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first precedent occurred under the McMahon Government. The Appropriations Bill (No. 3) 1971 was introduced to provide urgently needed additional funding&mdash;the same as we have here&mdash;for the Australian Wool Commission. In 1973, Appropriation Bills Nos. 3 and 4 were additional Bills which were necessary because of the change to the administrative arrangements orders, to provide funding for the Aboriginal advancement trust and to top up the advance to the Minister for Finance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1974, another additional Bill, Appropriation Bill (No. 3), was necessary to facilitate an increase in the pay of Defence Force personnel. The then Treasurer noted that Appropriation Bill (No. 1) needed early supplementation. In 1975 two additional Appropriation Bills covered additional spending because of Cyclone Tracy and the prior Premiers Conference. They were also necessary to cover other items in advance of the normal Additional Estimates. Last year, we had the special appropriation for the Gulf war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the seeking of an acceleration of funding for existing programs has precedents in 1971, 1974 and 1975. Governments of both persuasions have, on occasion, needed to seek short term funds to continue to provide essential community services&mdash;the sorts of community services for which this Bill seeks urgent appropriation. Senator Short has raised a different sort of precedent&mdash;the precedent for perhaps pre-empting the Senate Estimates processes. I look forward to hearing the Parliamentary Secretary's response to this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has also said that perhaps the Bill was necessary because some sort of special juggling is needed to fund the family allowance payment with which it is suggested the Government is attempting to buy the voters in the Wills by-election. But we know that this money has already been appropriated separately by legislation passed in the House of Representatives and the Senate. So the point to be made is that this Bill is not seeking to increase funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to what I think is the only matter of substance raised by the Opposition, and that is the question of Estimates committees. Parliament does have to approve spending by the Executive and must have the ability to supervise and to scrutinise the details of any such spending proposals. Accordingly, the Senate proposed and agreed to a motion on Friday that the Bill be referred to the Estimates Committees E and F, which will report on or before Wednesday 29 April. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can understand Senator Short's concern that maybe there is something fishy or that there is some sloppy bookkeeping. But I can also understand the Government's explanation of the need for urgency in the passage of this Bill. The Government says that Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) are not expected to pass the Senate until about 7 May and by that time, it claims, the Advance to the Minister for Finance will have been exhausted and payments for some significant social programs disrupted. So if it becomes clear that Appropriation Bill (No. 5) will not pass both Houses by 2 April, the Government claims it will be necessary to restrict the child-care fee relief payments due on 1 April from being paid quarterly in advance to being paid in advance on a six-weekly basis. I think that is the nub of it. It is claimed that this will cause many child-care providers great difficulty because many services are already experiencing cash flow problems and an unexpectedly reduced payment would aggravate this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Community Services and Health has service level agreements with over 4,000 services and at least half of these provide for quarterly in-advance payment arrangements. There is a question for the Government about whether it would be in breach of contract if this quarterly advance is changed to a six-weekly one. It is claimed by the Government, too, that, if it is forced to make a six-weekly payment, this would require manual calculation and that it is too late to do this and make the payments by the due date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>clearly, there are insufficient funds available in the Advance to the Minister for Finance to meet all the expected calls upon it before the normal Appropriation Bills are passed. I think it is normal to anticipate the possibility of other urgent and unforeseen circumstances. So perhaps it can be argued that it is quite reasonable to bring forward additional legislation to ensure that all the Government's obligations and responsibilities can be properly funded. The point, again, is that it is not additional funding; it is simply accelerated funding for projects already planned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have two competing principles: the principle of concern about a new precedent&mdash;the precedent of accelerated appropriation which by-passes or pre-empts the scrutiny of the full Senate Estimates processes&mdash;and the principle of worthy projects for which money has already been planned but which are in urgent need of funds. The Democrats approve of the projects in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Putting to one side suspicions of sloppy bookkeeping and suspicions of fishiness, in respect of which I am looking to the Parliamentary Secretary for an explanation, at this stage the Democrats have decided to support the people who would be affected by the restriction of these funds. We want to make sure that child-care fee relief in particular is paid as expected. But we, as Democrats, wonder why the Government does not simply introduce legislation which makes a standing appropriation for child-care fee relief of the kind that is dealt with in this Bill. Under such an arrangement, this sort of situation would not arise in the future. </PARA>

We are entitled to look at why we have this Appropriation Bill before us. Senator Short has spoken in the debate and advanced some views. Senator Kernot has just contributed to the debate and advanced some views. If one looks at the debate that took place in the other place, at the second reading speech of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook), or at the explanatory memorandum, one does not get an adequate explanation of why Appropriation Bill (No. 5) is before us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know what this Bill is seeking to do. It is seeking the appropriation of some $204m, of which $87m is for labour market reform assistance to job seekers and industry, $50m for residential fee relief for older people, and $66m for child-care fee relief. So we are talking about the unemployed, the elderly and children&mdash;all topics of great concern to all in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to speculate on why this Bill has come before us in this fashion, especially when all of these matters have been largely covered in Appropriation Bill (No. 3), which is also before this chamber at the present time. We have the unprecedented situation of matters being removed from another Bill so that their passage can be expedited in the Bill now before us. It may be thought strange that senators should ask for a better explanation. I think we are entitled to such an answer. There is a need to ask why the Government has not followed the normal procedure and has deemed it necessary to introduce the additional Appropriation Bill. In my view, it is not being fanciful to suggest that there is some sort of funding crisis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), in his second reading speech, said that the Bill contained the three items which I have mentioned. Referring to the expenditure, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . continuity of which the Government considers cannot be jeopardised by the timing of the availability of funds being dependent upon passage of Appropriation Bill (No.3) 1991-92. . .</PARA>
<PARA>If one were sensitive, one could almost take offence at that. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . payments for these measures are required in a time frame which, on the basis of current estimates, cannot be accommodated by the Advance to the Minister for Finance whilst awaiting passage of the additional Estimates.</PARA>
<PARA>Who conducts Estimates committees, Mr Acting Deputy President? The Senate does so. Is he suggesting there&mdash;and as I read his words, he is&mdash;that the Senate has something to do with Appropriation Bill (No. 3) being held up and this money not being available? The facts are that we have not and that can be proved to be the case. He is attempting to word the situation in such a way that it is being implied that the Senate has something to do with this money not being available. It is very clear that this money is not available because of the Government's own mismanagement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that the Government has no intention of letting this Bill go to the Estimates committees to be dealt with in the proper manner. It has no regard for any of the traditions of this Parliament; it will walk over the Parliament as it wishes. The Executive will have its way. It is time that the people of Australia came to understand the extent to which the Parliament is being totally ignored by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have indicated, the Government is seeking to rush through this Bill in a totally unprecedented manner. Shortfalls of funds of this kind are not new&mdash;we know that&mdash;and they are normally dealt with by an Advance to the Minister for Finance. That source does not seem to be available at this time either. So again we can ask what has happened and what has gone wrong. People would not mind if the Government came forward and told the Parliament honestly what has happened and why it is in this mess. Instead, we are being left to determine it for ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Finance claimed in the other place on 24 March:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have brought forward a specific Appropriation Bill rather than proposing an increase in the Advance to the Minister for Finance to fund these programs pending passage of the Additional Estimates.</PARA>
<PARA>Why is it being done in that fashion? As I said, gross mismanagement is the answer that I come to for the Government's not being prepared to treat this matter properly and put it through the Parliament in an orderly manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are in the middle of the recession we had to have. That has been said so often, but let us not forget it. Let us not forget who created it and who said that it was a recession we had to have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us go through some of the numbers. They are pretty big numbers and they are a bit hard to accommodate, perhaps, if one thinks in terms of one's own household budget. All of us know what sort of a mess we would get into if we let our household budgets get out of kilter in the way that this Government has been prepared to allow Australia's Budget to get out of kilter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The original Budget deficit forecast contained in the 1991-92 Budget was $4.732 billion. Prior to the economic statement, the Government issued a revised Budget deficit forecast of $6.3 billion. I suppose that, if it is said quickly enough, that figure sounds less than the last one. This figure was revised to $6.8 billion to reflect the new measures in the Government's economic statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the most recent statement of Commonwealth Government financial transactions issued by the Minister for Finance, the cumulative Budget deficit to January was $11.2 billion and, by February, $12.2 billion. We are now told to expect a staggering $8 billion deficit for the year 1992-93 and a high deficit for the next four years. An $8 billion deficit for 1992-93 represents eight Parliament Houses. It took us 10 years to build this place and pay for it, but that is what the Government can do in one year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Worse still is the fact that this Government has taken Australia from a forecast surplus of over $8 billion to a deficit of $8 billion in just two years&mdash;a turnaround of $16 billion. To me, that is a clear demonstration of the instability and inaccuracy of the Government's budgetary processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, what would happen to your household if you behaved in that manner, in proportion to your income, of course? Your bank manager would have called you in long since and dealt with you. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill seeks to meet increases in ongoing government expenditure not provided for previously. As everybody knows, many spending initiatives of the One Nation statement were lifted straight out of the Fightback package. These initiatives and many tax cuts, that is, forgone revenue, are things which the coalition would normally support&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>they are in the Fightback program&mdash;but the difference is that in the One Nation package they are totally unfunded. With these proposals, Australia faces the immediate and medium term prospect of huge increases in debt, with the consequences that we all know about&mdash;namely, huge interest rates to be paid and the impact of the exchange rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is pushing up Australia's debt at a time when we can least afford it. The question to be asked is: where will the money come from to fund all the measures in the One Nation statement? It is relevant to note that the Syntec organisation spoke of this. On 25 March, it released its estimation that One Nation will leave Australia with something like $18m in unfunded spending commitments over the next four years and will increase interest rates by 4 per cent, which will cost the business community around $8 billion. Of course, we all know who pays for that in the end, and that is the consumer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Finance has claimed&mdash;and I have already referred to this&mdash;that Appropriation Bill (No. 5) 1991-92, the Bill we are discussing today, is necessitated by delays in the passage of Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4).

A further $11m was promised in the One Nation statement.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CES figures used to be regarded as a reliable indication of unemployment levels until they became so embarrassingly high that they were abandoned.

People who lose their jobs but who have working spouses are not counted as being unemployed. Those not able to start work because they are sick, there is a lack of child-care facilities or for some other reason shortly after the survey are not counted as being unemployed.

There is the young person who says, `Will I ever get a job?'. There is the older person&mdash;people who are entitled to think that they would be able to work on for another 10 or 15 years&mdash;who says, `Am I finished? Have I nothing more to offer?'. What about the stress on the marriage, the stress on the family and the household of having one person&mdash;be it a young person or an older person&mdash;in its midst who is unemployed?

The hidden hardship in all of this is something that this Government does not seem to know about, to understand, or want to know about. Permanent damage is being done to the Australian spirit by this situation and the cavalier attitude of the Government towards it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet the Keating Labor Government seems happy to bring in as many red herrings and distortions as it can possibly think of to try to take the focus away from the real issues. It is spending $20 billion, which it does not have, to hide more unemployed in schools and TAFE colleges; to create what would be a few artificial jobs; and, hopefully, it thinks, to win a few votes in the electorate of Wills. Nobody is suggesting that education and training are not important. Let me be absolutely clear that Australia must have a skilled and well educated work force. But once that is done and students have been left in school for a year or two or put into TAFE courses&mdash;incidentally, not forgetting the thousands this year who could not get into universities and TAFE courses&mdash;unless there are real jobs at the end of it, nothing is actually achieved.

I could talk about Senior Citizens Week which is being held this week in Canberra. Care for older people is important when one looks at the way the population will be ageing. In June of 1989 an estimated 1,860,000 Australians were aged 65 or older, that is, 11.1 per cent of the total population. That figure is projected to increase to about 12 per cent by 2001, and to between 19 and 21 per cent by 2031. Of course, the elderly&mdash;the aged&mdash;are very important to this country, but we need policies which will enable our country to be prosperous if we are going to properly provide for the ageing population, not these stop-gap measures that we are looking at today. The sum of $67m is sought for child-care fee relief. In dealing with this Bill, the Minister said that it is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . an increase in the average amount per place for fee relief since the Budget Estimates were derived and a higher than expected number of child-care places available.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The presentation of Appropriation Bill (No. 5) 1991-92 is yet another chapter in the continuing saga of the errors this Government continues to make. The second reading speech really is quite an insulting document to present to the Senate. Here is a speech that simply says that the Government will appropriate $204,415,000, and that by appropriating this amount it will amend the existing Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4), which are currently subject to the Estimates hearings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one looks at the speech and sees the sort of number-fiddling that is going on, one realises that of that $204m, the Government is appropriating only about an additional $24m. If one looks at the program performance statements for appropriation Bills Nos. 3 and 4&mdash;specifically those for the Department of Employment, Education and Training&mdash;one sees at page 28 under program 4 `Labour Market Program Assistance', sub-program 1 `Employment Access', the appropriation of an additional $71m. When one looks at the schedule of Appropriation Bill (No. 5), one sees that it is appropriating approximately $87m for DEET. If we subtract one figure from the other, we find that all we are getting is an additional $16m for DEET. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one does a similar exercise with the program performance statements for Health, Housing and Community Services, one sees that with regard to `Residential Care For Older People', $50m is being appropriated. Guess what the Minister's speech and the schedule provided in Appropriation Bill (No. 5) tell us?  They tell us that the $50m appropriated by the Bills currently before the Estimates Committee will be cancelled out and reappropriated in Appropriation Bill (No. 5). One would have to ask why the Government is doing these things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On page 28 of the PPS document for Health, Housing and Community Services&mdash;Program 8 `Services For Families With Children: Child Care Fee Relief'&mdash;there is a sum appropriated of about $67m. We are appropriating $67m for child-care and subtracting the appropriated sum of some $43m or $45m, which means that all we are getting is an extra $24m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must ask ourselves why the Government is going through all these gymnastics. The reason is that it hopes to get its hot little hands on the money straight away without going through the Estimates proceedings; in other words, without the appropriation being justified in any way, shape or form. We must then ask ourselves the next question: Why is the Government trying to do that? Why is there this cover-up? Then comes the next question: Where is the money for that promised handout&mdash;the bribe of $125 for the first child up to a maximum $250 per family, to be paid just prior to the Wills by-election&mdash;coming from? Could one draw a scenario that says that the money is being taken away from other programs and that this money has to be appropriated desperately, otherwise the Government will not be able to meet the bills? Is that what it is? There are no PPS statements for this Appropriation Bill (No. 5). </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the Minister's statement contained in the two pages of what passes for a second reading speech, we see a reference to the fact that the Government does not want to use the Advance to the Minister of Finance. I had a look at how much money was left in that Advance. Under Appropriation Bill (No. 1), where $170m was appropriated, there remains $92m in available cash. Under Appropriation Bill (No. 2) there is still $128m remaining. If the sums are done on the jiggery-pokery that is going on with this Bill, one finds that the total amount being looked for is about $40m. There is $92m under the Advance for the Minister for Finance. The Advance for the Minister for Finance can be activated if the Government gets it wrong. Clearly, the Government has got it wrong. If one reads the DEET program performance statements, one sees that they set out quite simply the purpose of the Additional Estimates with regard to labour market program assistance. Page 28 reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Enhancements to the Employment Access Program (EAP) were announced in the 1991 November Economic Statement. These enhancements were in recognition of an expected growth in the level of long-term unemployment over the next 12 to 18 months and the need to maintain an appropriate level of program assistance for this group.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner, I was perhaps giving vent to some of the anger I feel at the way the Parliament is being manipulated by bringing in a fifth Appropriation Bill while Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) are still being dealt with by the Estimates process. Although in this chamber we may use those terms and understand what the debate is about, I am rather concerned that people who read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> ought also to understand the proper method for allowing governments to have money to spend to implement their policies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, governments have no money of their own. They have only taxpayers' money. The way they are allowed to spend taxpayers' money to implement their policies is by way of money being appropriated&mdash;set aside, allocated&mdash;for the programs that they outline and which are in some detail published, and which the Estimates committees then scrutinise. This process is gone through twice a year. When the Budget comes down, we get Appropriation Bill (No. 1) and Appropriation Bill (No. 2). We have two of these Bills because one is for recurrent expenditure and the other is for capital expenditure. This similarly applies to Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4), which we get six months later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We regularly have two sets of Appropriation Bills because, when a Budget is brought in, it is nothing but an estimate of what might happen in the next 12 months. It is the Government's best guess or, more accurately, the best guess of the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Finance of what might happen. As I have pointed out in this chamber before, Treasury gets it wrong every year. Obvious evidence of that is the fact that the Government has had to introduce additional Bills to allocate extra money for estimates that were not quite right. Sometimes an extra amount of money is allocated because of a CPI increase and the additional wages that have to be paid, but there are all sorts of other reasons, such as, simply, errors and omissions. There is a mechanism for that too. At the time Appropriation Bill (No. 1) and Appropriation Bill (No. 2) are brought in, we also bring in something known as the Advance to the Minister for Finance&mdash;and that comes in two parts too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time the last Appropriation Bill (No. 1) and Appropriation Bill (No. 2) came in, there was appropriated&mdash;that is, set aside, earmarked&mdash;$170m for recurrent expenditure and $140m for capital expenditure. Basically, if the Government suddenly finds that its calculations for any department&mdash;not just Treasury and Finance but, say, DEET, that we are dealing with here, and the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services&mdash;are in error, it has not calculated correctly, there has been an unforeseen event, it can make an application under that Advance to the Minister for Finance to allocate that money to the department until there is a new Appropriation Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is so unusual about this current situation and what makes it so different from last year when we had an extra Bill&mdash;the extra Bill was needed to pay for the Gulf war, when we had countries that did not pay for the wheat they had bought from us and there were legitimate, spelt out reasons for needing that emergency legislation&mdash;is that, in this case, there is no rhyme or reason contained in the second reading speech of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook). There are no published additional program performance statements. There is not one iota of sustaining evidence as to why this Bill is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I pointed out before the suspension of the sitting for dinner, in effect this Bill amends particularly Appropriation Bill (No. 3)&mdash;that is the one that makes up for the mistakes for recurrent expenditure&mdash;and it wipes out certain amounts that have been set aside, appropriated, for some programs. It appropriates in two cases a greater figure, but in a third case it simply wipes out the appropriated amount and reappropriates it. Why would the Government want to do something like that?  Very simply, it has to do with the speed with which the Government wants to get its grubby hands on the money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we do our figures, as I did before dinner, we see that $71m had already been allocated for the labour market program; now the Government is seeking to wipe that out and reappropriate $87m. In the case of residential care for the aged, $50m had been allocated; the Government seeks to wipe out that figure and reappropriate or set aside $50m. In the area of child-care relief, $45m had been allocated; now the Government is going to reallocate $67m. There seems to be some discrepancy between the figure of $43m that is mentioned in the second reading speech and the figure of $45m that is mentioned in the program performance statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, all up, we are talking about a figure for recurrent expenditure of about $40m. If we read the reasons in the PPS notes&mdash;they are the explanations as to why the Government wants the additional money&mdash;we see that the predictions as to how the economy is impacting on these programs has already been taken into account. As Senator Reid said, these additional Appropriation Bills were introduced on 26 February and here we are in March and the Government is saying, `We got it wrong again by a further $40m'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the real explanation?  Again before dinner, I mentioned the fact that we have this enormous bribe, the one-off payment being made by way of family assistance payment with a figure in the vicinity of $125 for the eldest child going up to a maximum of $250. I have not done the precise calculation as to how many millions of dollars that comes out at, but I do know it comes out at about the sorts of figures that we are dealing with in Appropriation Bill (No. 5). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the event that what has really happened is that the Government has actually transferred money out of other programs for which it has been properly appropriated and, in fact, needs to get its hands on this money quickly, then what it is doing is bringing in a Bill which is designed to get around the proper system of accountability. We could say it is cheating. We could say it is the most appalling abuse of process. Why the hurry; why the speed?  Because of the date of the Wills by-election, by which time this Government wants to pay its bribe. What an appalling way to run a Government!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But then, why should I be surprised?  Only this evening at dinner with the visiting German delegation, I listened to the leader of that delegation make a speech in reply to the speech of welcome. He acknowledged that many discussions on the Uruguay Round were needed. He acknowledged also the need, from Australia's point of view, for a reduction in the common agricultural policy, the subsidies that Europe pays that unfairly penalise Australian products. The leader of the German delegation, having seen in the last 48 hours the double back flip which the Prime Minister has tried to do with regard to tariff levels, said, `Well, of course, we all have our difficulties, don't we?'&mdash;and one could almost hear the cynicism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been saying that we wanted a fair deal, yet here we were again trying to do a double flip for the benefit of the Wills by-election. We are sending all the wrong signals to our international trading partners. For years we have been saying, `We are reducing our tariff levels and we want you to reduce the subsidies so that our farmers can get a fair deal'. All that work can be undone by the sheer cynical act of a man desperate to hang on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill is perhaps the biggest affront of all time. The Government is trying to race it through in time to get its hands on the money. It is not using the Advance to the Minister for Finance. Perhaps the Government has something else that it wants to use that $92m for. But this is an absolutely disgraceful abuse of the Parliament and the parliamentary process. It is an abuse of the system of scrutiny and accountability. The questions that should be asked about why this money is needed and why the departments have allegedly got the figures wrong need be asked before the Wills by-election and, indeed, before the Bill goes through the Parliament. Yet, this will not happen. The Government will shove and push to try to get this legislation through without allowing any scrutiny of it at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One wonders and becomes disappointed about many things in the parliamentary process.

The Government has certainly learnt from the Fightback package and has taken a number of the items that we proposed.

I do not really blame them. Mr Keating is firmly on record as saying that he had his hands on the levers; that it is all his work; that he is the one who has pulled the levers and directed the economy. I suppose it is only now, because of the anger of Australians at the complete and absolute mess that Mr Keating has made of this country, that he is trying to squirm his way out of it. He is attempting to wriggle out of and shed some of the real blame for the recession that Australia is in at the moment. </PARA>

The only way that the dole queues are likely to get any shorter in Australia is if Mr Keating tells the people in the queues to stand a little closer together. The Government has no policies that might do anything about it. Simply throwing more money at training programs and job-seeker initiatives will not achieve what needs to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose that if one works on the adage that we learn by our mistakes, Australia can probably rejoice that we have Mr Keating as Prime Minister.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating's about-face on tariffs is simply typical. I am pleased to say that Australians are picking up the fact that Mr Keating is simply floating in the breeze. After nine years of saying that we have to have zero tariffs&mdash;cut tariffs right down&mdash;now, because he thinks it will get him a few cheap votes in the Wills by-election, he is changing his tune.

<PARA>Is Mr Keating telling the people of Wills about that? The people of Wills, I guess, are in that bracket of $26,000 or less. Many of them would be holding jobs with incomes of less than $20,000 a year.

It looks like we need an extra $3m as a result of that leadership spill we had to have&mdash;the sticking of the knife into the back of Mr Hawke. Because of that, we need an extra $3m to change the staff around. To give the ex-Prime Minister a few extra staff will cost us $703,000. They are only figures; they just roll off the tongue. It is easy to spend that sort of money when it is not your money, Mr Deputy President. I hope Mr Keating has some thoughts of remorse when he thinks about this. </PARA>

He had to promise them something to get some votes. It did not do much for the Queenslanders in the ALP&mdash;they did not get anything out of it. But he promised them a bit of a cut, a bit of a pay-off, so he had to get new parliamentary secretaries as a reward for voting for him, and we need eight new staff for that at a cost of $703,000.

He is very interested in the important things in life, such as rearranging the Prime Minister's suite, so that he can have a better outlook or so that he can see his staff better.

Appropriation Bill No. (5) seeks an appropriation of about $204m less than a fortnight before the full review and scrutiny by Parliament of Appropriation Bill (No.3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4). It is being introduced to accommodate special circumstances arising from the Government's statement on the economy and employment made last November. Special circumstances, yet the statement was made last November!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are still waiting to debate legislation from as far back as March of last year&mdash;12 months ago. There is probably some before that, but even I cannot remember everything that this Government does not do. All of a sudden this Bill is important and has to come in here ahead of the Bills being considered by the Estimates committees, yet the special circumstances it covers were announced last November in the statement on the economy and employment and in the recent One Nation package. The second reading speech says it is `to ensure continuity of funding for other important Government initiatives'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill addresses only three items of expenditure: labour market program assistance to job seekers, care for older people and child-care fee relief. I can accept that perhaps one of those is urgent&mdash;that is, the first one&mdash;even though it was first announced in November. But surely the other two can wait less than a fortnight. Senator McMullan probably knows when we will finish Appropriation Bill (No. 3). It is interesting that Appropriation Bill (No. 3) has been amended before we have even got to it, although we have been told that there will be full scrutiny by the Parliament afterwards&mdash;full scrutiny after the money has been allocated! That is like trying a murderer after he has been executed, and I certainly hope that never happens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the only urgency in this case is the Wills by-election, which is about 11 days away.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the dinner break I saw an advertisement on television which started off by saying, `It all started in 1983'.

Once I saw that the advertisement was not telling us about this disastrous Government, I did not take much notice of what it was about. That is how any advertisement could start: `The decline of this country started in 1983'. I will work on that later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation has come on with five minutes notice, even though it has been around for 12 months. It is the Government putting out spot fires. I do not know whether anyone in this place has ever been a member of a bushfire brigade&mdash;probably not, unless Senator Walsh walks into the chamber. The first thing to learn when putting out fires is to attack the whole fire, not the spot fires. That is what this Government has been doing&mdash;it has been putting out spot fires and letting the big fire go on and on. As I have said already, we are dealing with legislation that the Government mooted more than 12 months ago. </PARA>

I understand that job seekers were allocated $71m in November, $11m in the One Nation package and now more. I have nothing against that. My heart goes out to job seekers the more I see of the harder hit areas of Australia in this recession. Fortunately, I come from an area where we can ride the recession. It is an area rich in farming. Wheat prices have improved greatly in the last 12 months. When we planted last year's crop, to be harvested last Christmas, we expected about $120 a tonne and, fortunately, we finished up with $180 a tonne. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wool has improved. We are in the centre of a big goldmining area, even though the gold price is not so good and the mining industry is being knocked around by this Government's gold tax. Other measures have also knocked it around. It is an area where we can see the recession, but we can ride it. But it is soul destroying to go into areas such as the Wills electorate, and some electorates in Perth, and talk to people who have copped it from the recession, and I will refer to them later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can understand the Government's urgency with regard to job seekers, but as far as the other two areas are concerned, child care and the elderly, surely the appropriation can wait for a few weeks. Residential care for older people has not accelerated in the last week to the extent that suddenly the Government needs the money and cannot wait for the next two weeks. Child-care relief is the same. Have things fallen over that much in three weeks that the child-care relief cannot wait for the scrutiny of Parliament? Everyone is silent on it. This Government is putting out spot fires and, of course, looking to the Wills electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will speak a little on the Wills electorate. I have spent a day in that area. One of the reasons I went into that area was that a lot of people there have a background similar to mine. Even though I say so myself, they are people who look after themselves and certainly know how to endure. I started off by talking to businessmen. I did not necessarily pick ethnic businessmen, but as I went through a shopping centre, they all seemed to be there. They all tell the story that when they first migrated they worked in the factories, in transport and the like. Their eventual aim&mdash;after bringing up a family, building a home and paying off the home completely, but perhaps still educating children&mdash;was to try their hand at business. That went along quite well for a while until this recession came along. Now they are battling with whatever is loaded on them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the Victorian Government's going broke has added to their woes. It is ever increasing the land tax and every tax it can. Those costs are loaded on to the lessee. The terms of a lease state that when a shop in a shopping centre is leased, the lessee takes on the obligation to pay the rent and the land tax. That is normal and he accepts it. But when a lease is signed for five years with an option&mdash;there is generally a review of the rent period when the lease is renewed at two-and-a-half years&mdash;the lessee pays when the land tax and the water rates double. He also pays a share of the electricity costs for public lighting&mdash;not just for his consumption of electricity&mdash;when they double and treble. They are things that the Government has not taken into consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whereas these shop owners were employing one or two girls, now the husband and wife are in the shop or perhaps it is just the wife trying to keep the business going while the husband is trying to get a job if he can. That is the sort of thing you see. I talked to them about business and talked to the people who came into the shops. The downheartedness of the people is certainly heart-rending and soul-destroying to see. I come from an area which is tough, but we can generally do something to help ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I talked to a person who had migrated as a very young person and started working in factories. He lost his job three years ago. Over the years in this place I have always been a critic of the unemployed, as I have always believed that if people are genuinely looking for work, they can generally get it. But I can see that in a big electorate such as Wills, people with a socioeconomic background of working in factories&mdash;factories that were not able to keep up and were not able to be competitive and export on the world market&mdash;just cannot get jobs. Senator Faulkner may understand this if he has that sort of electorate in Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have always reckoned that with an unemployment rate of up to 5 per cent, there are those who do not want to work and I suppose society can carry them. We now have a 10 per cent unemployment rate, one million people unemployed, and there has to be something wrong. Responsibility for this rate of unemployment can be laid right at the door of the Government because of the policies it has had since 1983. So I certainly learnt a lesson by spending a day in the Wills area. Anyone who has not had the experience, I believe, should go there and see how people are feeling. </PARA>

We had the golden fifties and the golden sixties; we had a part of the seventies that was golden; and then the former Prime Minister took over the ACTU. There was a big wage push which caused inflation and away things went. He was rewarded with a prime ministership and he had a Treasurer who gave us the recession we had to have. What did he get as his reward? He got the prime ministership, aided by half of those opposite and half of the Government members in the House of Representatives, plus one, two, three, four or something like that. He was rewarded with the prime ministership. As far as I am concerned, if Mr Keating wanted to be Prime Minister, he should have been elected by the people. Having toppled Mr Hawke as Prime Minister, he should have immediately gone to an election to get a mandate. I am sure everyone knows that he would not have got a mandate. Of course, now we have a recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me get down to the Wills electorate and the textile factories and so on. The Government has changed its tune on tariffs in the last week because it is expedient for the Wills by-election. The Government has been saying that it has a better tariff reduction policy than the Opposition. I thought that at least it might have had an equal period of reduction, but suddenly the Prime Minister, Mr Keating&mdash;because of the Wills by-election and because he thinks it will build up his popularity&mdash;has weakened on tariff reduction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Button has blamed McEwen, Fraser and Menzies&mdash;those good Prime Ministers over the years&mdash;for having too much protection. But let history judge that protection. Let history also judge what has happened since 1983. If there is any reason why the factories of Australia since 1983 have been let run down so that they cannot compete with the rest of the world as far as production goes&mdash;just leave too high wages aside&mdash;it has been the investment allowance that this Government cut out. The depreciation schedule was also wrecked by this Government. There was a good depreciation schedule which encouraged people in business, in factories, on farms and in mines to reinvest in equipment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only thing wrong with Fraser's investment allowance was that he did not have the investment allowance portion on Australian-made goods. I always reckoned that that was his mistake, when we had some factories in Australia manufacturing heavy machinery, agricultural machinery and mining machinery. If he had kept that investment allowance on the Australian-made portion, with a good depreciation system on the rest, what came in from overseas, as he had, that would have been the ultimate position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Walsh from Doodlakine in Western Australia reckoned that there were too many rorts in the system, so the investment allowance went out and the depreciation periods were extended. That is why factories have been let run down. That is why mining plant has been let run down. If people go out into farming areas now, they can see that farming plant is getting too old. Even when the good seasons or the better prices come back, it takes a long time to build up farming plant. In the meantime, dealerships that import that farm machinery have gone into liquidation for other reasons to do with the way in which the Government has run this country. One of the reasons a lot of farm machinery dealers go into liquidation has been the fact that farmers have not been able to purchase equipment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the same in the mining industry. When this Government slapped on the gold tax, the immediate reaction was to stop exploration. Once general exploration stops, the next thing is that the exploration drill stops. I know that 80 per cent of the drilling contractors in Western Australia are now in liquidation. That is the result of the gold tax. The miners tell me that they are not doing badly because, even though the price of gold is down, their product is high graded and they are able to extract high class ore. However, in Western Australia the amount of exploration involving drilling has gone down, as has maintenance. That is where this Government has gone wrong. The industry has declined not, as Senator Button said, because the Menzies Government retained tariffs for too long, but because of this Government's investment allowance policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that most honourable senators and Treasury officials have read the Hewson package properly. In fact, each time that the Treasury looks at it, it gives the package better and better reports, particularly since the Treasury's first disgraceful exhibition on the ABC's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS>.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The job losses have been not only in those textile factories of Melbourne, but also where there are many highly educated people. I know the approach of the Government and others to unemployment&mdash;and I totally agree&mdash;is to poke a lot of money towards education. I applaud the Government for that because the best thing for those who are unemployed, either generally or within a particular field, is to educate and train themselves for something better when opportunities come along. So one cannot blame those in semi-professional and professional jobs who lose their jobs for not being trained, because they are trained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give some examples of what I know has happened in a couple of accounting firms in Western Australia in the past few weeks. There are some accountants within these firms who have been employed for three to seven years. At four o'clock on Friday afternoon, a fellow comes into one accountant's office and says, `I want to see you'. At 5 o'clock, the accountant walks out with his termination pay, a reference and holiday pay. He is out the door. He had spent five years in the place, but was gone within an hour. Firms can no longer afford to employ people like that accountant. It is tragic for these employees and for their families. These people were educated and they trained for their jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another example is in the banking system. Some of those involved have a shorter length of education, but in that industry the same sort of thing is happening. Girls and boys, and men from 25 to 45 years of age, are getting what they call the `green folder'. During the day a supervisor will go to an employee and say, `Come with me'. The employee is taken in, given a half an hour's debriefing or words of encouragement, and is given a green folder. It contains a reference, a pay cheque, a superannuation payment&mdash;or whatever the entitlements are&mdash;and a cab charge. Such employees are told to catch a cab home and not go back to their desks. Their access code to the bank's computer is wiped out, so they cannot get back or get their mates to go back and do some damage to the computer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These things are happening every day. My life has been insulated from such things. As I said before, I live in the country, where people can do something for themselves. But it is heart-rending to hear stories of people who live in cities with large populations. Those present are employed and most of our children are employed. I can say `Thank the Lord that my four children are employed', but these things are happening to the next door neighbour and to those around the corner.

The other two elements of it could have waited. However, I return to where I started. This Government has been putting out spot fires since 1983. It has not attacked the full avalanche of fire. It is no good taking the Hewson package bit by bit hoping to convince the people that these problems will be solved. This Government must be dinkum if it thinks that this One Nation package is right and that Mr Keating can be Prime Minister for the next three to five years and turn this country around. </PARA>

The Wills by-election was caused by the retirement of the former Prime Minister after he was unloaded unceremoniously by his own people. He had to get out of Parliament or the House of Representatives would not have settled down. Having read Senator Robert Ray's remarks about Mr Speaker in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> the other week, I do not think things have settled down 100 per cent. But we will let that go by. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Mr Keating thinks he can do those things, he should go to a full-blown election. Perhaps he will get an idea of how successful he will be from the Wills by-election. Unfortunately, he will get that much of a shock in the Wills by-election that he will not go straight away to a full election, but will want to hang around at least until 19 December so that 12 months is up. He might leave it a bit beyond that because, if I am correct,  I believe that the election can be delayed until May next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Government thinks it can turn the country around, let it go to a full election. I believe that the people of Australia will do what deserves to be done to the Labor Government for what it has done since 1983. They should put Labor members into isolation for the next 30 or 40 years. Dr Hewson will then turn the place around. I invite the Government to go out and give it a go. If it cannot do it, it should let Dr Hewson have a go. If we do not turn Australia around in the next 12 months or so or start doing so, we may as well all turn in our citizenship, pack up and try our luck in some other place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought I should start my remarks in summing up by reminding anybody who happens to be listening, or who might subsequently might read reports of this debate, that we are talking about Appropriation Bill (No. 5). It would have taken a great deal of imagination for anybody to actually work that out. There has been only the most passing reference to it during the past hour and a bit and in most of the debate beforehand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my comments I shall try to put aside some of the misunderstandings that people seem to have about the origins of this Bill and some of the conspiracy theories that abound concerning its origins, and then comment briefly on the second reading amendment that is being proposed and the other proposal concerning a reference to committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question that was asked was: `If there was a need for Appropriation Bill (No. 5), why was it not perceived beforehand?'. This question was first raised by Senator Short, who would be well aware that the Additional Estimates are drawn together after the close of the Budget session when the annual Appropriation Bills have been approved by the Parliament and are introduced early in the autumn sittings for consideration by the Parliament. Since 1980-81 those Bills have not passed the Senate and received royal assent until May or early June. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I use the point to clarify a bit of the elastic imagination around the place that somehow or other if we did not pass Appropriation Bill (No. 5), the other Bills would be passed in a fortnight. That is very interesting because we have not even got those Appropriation Bills before us yet. The Estimates Committee has not reported back and even if all the Estimates committees finish on time, the Parliament will not get the opportunity to start considering them until 28 April. That is the first day on which we can start the second reading speeches, and an optimist might contemplate getting them passed by 7 May. That would be an early date for their passage.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is not the same as a fortnight in terms of paying bills to people. So, first of all we have to appreciate that we are talking about a significantly different period of time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the introduction of the Additional Estimates on 26 February, the Department of Finance sought from departments and agencies details of potential calls on the AMF on the basis of a normal passage of the Additional Estimates, that is, a normal timetable. It was only after this review that a potential excess demand for recourse to the AMF became apparent. So that review was conducted in the normal process. The fact that there may be an excessive demand on the AMF&mdash;that is, the Advance to the Minister for Finance&mdash;became apparent and remedial action was necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That raises the question: why can we not just draw on the AMF, pending passage of the Additional Estimates in a few weeks? The most important thing to remember is that moneys can be spent only for the purposes for which they have been provided. Therefore, a lot of this talk about the way money might be appropriated here to finance promises that were made and funded by quite separate legislation with regard to the One Nation package is entirely misconceived. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Brewing in the minds of some who see conspiracies in every matter is another conspiracy here. I would say to Senator Bishop in particular&mdash;she is wont to seeing these great conspiracies; and I heard her outlining her conspiracy theory here this evening&mdash;that when we see sinister plots, conspiracies and underhand tactics in everybody else's motivations and in everything they do, it tends to be a reflection of that which motivates the viewer rather than the viewed. When we think we are perceiving other people's motives through a window, I suspect we are often looking into a mirror. I think that is very much the circumstance on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Additional Estimates are not going to be passed within this sitting fortnight; that is obvious to everybody. Let me use child-care fee relief as an example. The practice required by contractual arrangements is that payments are usually provided quarterly in advance to defray the costs of child-care to low and middle income earners. Almost all the amounts sought in the Additional Estimates will be due to be paid on 1 April or, at the latest, in the first week in April. So we cannot just pro rata the expenditure throughout the period up to the end of the financial year, or even up to the time of the passage of the Additional Estimates, and assume that resources will be available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So can I firstly dispel the conspiracy theory and explain the circumstances in which we found the need for these Additional Estimates. Everybody would prefer to never have to introduce such a thing as Appropriation Bill (No. 5), but it is a reasonably minor matter in the great scheme of government and economic management. Those who wish to make allegations of incompetence need to be a little careful about the standards of competence which they set for themselves. First of all we had people throwing around the allegation&mdash;I think Senator Short said it at a press conference&mdash;that, somehow or another, this money is actually required only because we have to have it; we have had extra calls on expenditure for family allowance and the family allowance supplement generated by the One Nation package. Quite clearly, that is not the case, as I have outlined. The appropriation for that flowed from legislation already passed by this Parliament&mdash;legislation especially required for that circumstance. It was not out of these appropriations, nor was it from the Advance to the Minister for Finance, nor could it have been. So there is no conspiracy theory. The competence question on that matter remains with the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Alston also gave one of his more learned displays of his knowledge of government finance in this area. Somehow or other he had discovered that there was a $69m under-expenditure in the area of labour market programs. Recently he asked my colleague Senator Cook why, in view of this, we needed an extra appropriation. He even put out a news release on 24 March to that effect. I do not know who his source is in the Department of Employment, Education and Training, but he should say to that source, `Please explain your documents a little better', because lawyers cannot always understand things. Quite clearly, Senator Alston did not. There is absolutely no basis for this claim. He has made this wild allegation which I suppose is based on a leaked document from somewhere. Maybe someone sent him a bogus document; more likely, someone sent him a legitimate document and he failed to understand it. There is absolutely no basis for the claim that there will be an underspending of $69m against the $454m provision. In fact, we do require the Additional Estimate that is coming forward tonight. It is just another wild flight of fantasy from those opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People have also made remarkable assertions that neither Treasury nor the Department of Finance ever get the Estimates precisely right. That has to be one of the most ridiculous comments of public life. Nobody has ever got to the situation where all the assumptions that have to be built in to calculate expenditure, to make expenditure estimates&mdash;which is what they are&mdash;have been right. Everybody gets it wrong every year. This is inevitable for three reasons: firstly, the assumptions can never be perfect; secondly, the circumstances will change and evolve during the year; and thirdly, there are questions of policy change. Governments cannot set policy only once a year, on Budget night, and never have another change. Circumstances change; governments have to adapt to meet changing circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those reasons, we will always require Additional Estimates. There is nothing extraordinary about that. It is not a question of people getting it wrong. It is a question of the necessary modification that has always been required in public finance in every country of common political origin, every Westminster system style government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then come to the question of a concern about the loss of accountability if the items contained in this Bill are passed, rather than being referred to a committee. It is important that we have proper mechanisms of accountability in this Parliament. At this stage we do not have that; we have to rely on Estimates committees, which is very much a second best form of accountability. The problem that people perceive in this accountability question is a product of their obsession with Estimates committee hearings as the process of accountability and the fact that we do not have adequate alternative mechanisms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no question of manipulation here. Every dollar of public expenditure will, and should be, referred to an Estimates committee for scrutiny. We support that; that has already happened. It will need to go there; it should go there; we support it going there. But it is grossly irresponsible to contemplate deferring the passage of this legislation so that that review can take place beforehand. Inevitably and necessarily, that would mean that the Government would have to renegotiate the payments; for example, it would have to cease or curtail the payments for low income child-care relief. The one thing that Senator Bishop said in her speech that was correct was that the Government does not have money of its own; it only has money which is appropriated by the Parliament. It cannot spend money that has not been appropriated. If we have not appropriated money for that child-care fee relief, then the Government has no capacity to meet those necessary and socially desirable payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The programs will be available for scrutiny. They will be referred to the Estimates Committee. The departmental officers will be available to be examined about those programs. People could only believe this procedure to be entirely inappropriate&mdash;and the extra Appropriation Bill was dealt with in the same manner last year, when we referred the particulars to the Estimates Committee even though the Bill had been passed&mdash;if they have some fantasy about not passing the legislation or not passing the Estimates. That is the only significance of the Appropriation legislation in this one instance being passed in this minor way before Estimates Committee starts to deal with it&mdash;or concludes dealing with it, because it may well have started. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we had an adequate, year-round process of accountability instead of this twice-yearly obsession with Estimates-based accountability as the only form of proper review, problems like this would not cause any possible crisis of accountability. Every dollar will be referred to the Estimates Committee. Every program will be available for the scrutiny of the Parliament. That is as it should be and as it will continue to be. It will not be affected by the passage of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While people and governments would prefer never to have to introduce Bills of this sort&mdash;it would be neater and more elegant if it did not occur&mdash;there is no question that any of the conspiracy theories have a foundation. This is a necessary piece of legislation to fund necessary and socially responsible expenditure. It is appropriate for the Senate to deal with it with due speed so that those contractual and socially responsible commitments of government can continue to be met. By passing the appropriations funding, the Commonwealth will continue to meet its obligations in these three areas without any loss of accountability or proper scrutiny by the Parliament. At the same time we will know that we have passed the appropriations that will enable these socially responsible programs to be funded and these Commonwealth commitments to be met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the passage of the Bill. I really do not think that the second reading amendment deserves significant consideration. It is just one of those tired old cliches. I could have a bit of fun with poor old Senator Short's attempt to rehash the GST debate in the second reading debate, but I think he was only trying to pad out the last five minutes of his speech, so I will let that go. There will be other occasions. I understand that he is embarrassed by the impact of the data that is being distributed in Wills. I do not intend to divert the Senate at this time of the evening.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his comments tonight, Senator McMullan said that the Government would abide by the Senate Estimates processes and  would allow full scrutiny of the proposed items of expenditure, but that that scrutiny would take place after the Bill containing the items had been passed by the Parliament. The whole process of the Estimates procedure&mdash;the whole process on which the Senate operates so far as its scrutiny of expenditure is concerned&mdash;is such that the Senate assures and satisfies itself that the expenditure contained in legislation is appropriate before it passes the necessary legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government now proposes to turn that process on its head. Senator McMullan is saying that the Government has a problem, so we should pass this Bill and then look at the items. If that is done in the Estimates Committee, all honour will be done because the Estimates Committee procedure has been adopted. Whether the Estimates Committee finds fault with the expenditure will not really matter because the Bill will have been passed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The suggestion that there should be consideration of expenditure proposals after a Bill has been passed makes an absolute mockery of Senate procedure. It is a denigration of the Parliament. It is a classic example of the arrogance of the Executive and of this Government's total disdain for the Parliament. I wish Senator McMullan would listen to this because I think he rightly regards himself as a parliamentarian who respects the proper processes of the Parliament. Given that he does regard himself as a parliamentarian&mdash;with some justification&mdash;I find it extraordinary that he should propose a procedure which prostitutes the parliamentary processes and places the Executive above the Parliament in the consideration of what is, perhaps, the most important of all roles of the Parliament, and that is the proper scrutiny of the expenditure of public money. It shows a total disdain for the processes of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the Democrats will understand and accept that proposition. We are not seeking to frustrate the Government in its program. This is a Budget-type Bill. Of course, the Government will get its Bill. But it should get its Bill in accordance with following the proper procedures of the Parliament&mdash;the long established processes which this Parliament has fought hard and long over many, many years, indeed throughout its history, to develop, and those processes of which this Parliament rightly has pride. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The role of this Parliament is to keep the Executive honest, and to assure itself that money is properly appropriated and the expenditure proposals are examined to the satisfaction of this Parliament before legislation is passed. No amount of words, on behalf of the Government, proposing that we turn that whole process absolutely on its head can disguise the fact that what the Government is proposing to do here is a total travesty of the whole of the parliamentary process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats have prided themselves&mdash;and I know we are often very critical of their lack of sticking with this&mdash;that they are going to keep us all honest, keep the Parliament honest, keep political parties honest. If we were tonight to agree to follow a procedure which was contrary to the long-established&mdash;and for very good reasons long-established&mdash;principles and procedures of this Parliament in relation to the scrutiny of public moneys, we would create a grave crime against the Parliament and against the proper interests of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know whether there is a conspiracy in this. I do not know whether there is any relationship between the Government's requirement for $317m by the end of this week to pay its bribe to electors in advance of the Wills by-election. As I said in my remarks today, prime facie there is not a relationship between the two. But I know that it is very suspicious, and I know that the action that the Government is proposing in Appropriation Bill (No. 5), to bring in a new Bill and, at the same time, amend Bills within the Parliament and in the normal process of parliamentary scrutiny, is unprecedented in our history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raised several very pertinent questions about this in my speech on the second reading today. I do not believe that Senator McMullan has properly addressed those points. I will not go over them all again, but I drew the attention of the Senate to the advice that we had received as late as 4 o'clock last Friday afternoon that in the current account, if you like, or Appropriation No. 1 account for the Advance to the Minister for Finance there is about $90m of unexpended funds. </PARA>
<PARA>We have been told, on the other hand, that the AMF did not really have any funds in it. That is something that has not properly, to my mind, been addressed. There are numerous other questions that I raised which I do not believe that the Minister addressed in his response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the amendment moved by Senator Bjelke-Petersen is asking the Senate to simply follow long-established principles of this Senate and, indeed, to follow the motion that the Senate passed on the last sitting day&mdash;just on Thursday of last week&mdash;to refer these items of expenditure to the relevant Estimates committees, E and F, and to await the consideration by those committees of these items and to await the report back to the Senate by those committees on or before 29 April 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note the dates that Senator McMullan referred to in his address, and I note the concerns that he has expressed, but they do not overcome the need to follow proper process. They do not explain, and the senator in charge of the Bill, Senator McMullan, has not explained, how the Government could have got it all wrong&mdash;that is what this amounts to&mdash;as recently as four weeks ago with the introduction of Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) covering most of these items of expenditure. The Government must surely have known then if there was a problem in terms of funding and the timing of funding. If it did not know then, then if there is not a conspiracy involved in this whole exercise&mdash;and I am not suggesting that there necessarily is&mdash;it reeks of monumental incompetence by the Government in terms of its management of the affairs of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is asking this Senate to take unprecedented action to allow the Government to get out of a hole that its monumental incompetence or mismanagement or something else has got it into. It would be a disgrace on the part of this Senate if we were to go along with what the Government is proposing tonight, because it would be a total abrogation of our responsibilities to the people of Australia to ensure that proper scrutiny and examination of proposed government expenditure is undertaken and that we are satisfied on that before we pass legislation involving that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not talking about chickenfeed. We are talking about more than $200m of taxpayers' funds. This side of the Senate, for one, is not going to be party to legislating for that amount of money in total contradiction of, and with total disdain for, everything that has been built up by this Senate over many years, throughout its history, and of which we are, rightly, very proud on behalf of the people of Australia: namely, the need for proper parliamentary scrutiny of expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know what the attitude of the Democrats is on this matter. I hope that they will have listened very carefully to my remarks tonight, because a failure by this Senate to adopt this motion will set back the proper and legitimate processes of this Senate and of this Parliament  on behalf of the people of Australia by many, many years. So I urge the Democrats to give very careful consideration to this proposal. I will listen with a very great interest to their response. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I said on the second reading, we are very aware of the choice here, and it is not an easy choice. We are talking about a precedent of referring this legislation to Estimates committees after the third reading. I am aware of that. I talked on the second reading about the precedents which already exist for emergency appropriation of funds. Indeed, we did that last year with the Gulf War. The Opposition did not find that very extraordinary. I guess it depends on one's definition of necessary and socially responsible expenditure. So that is the first choice&mdash;the choice of precedent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second choice is the urgent need for this appropriation, particularly for fee relief for child-care&mdash;and we are talking about something like 4,000 child-care providers who would be affected in the first instance. There is also the matter, which Senator McMullan touched on and which I did raise with Senator Short, of the contractual obligations of the Government: the difference between meeting these payments on a six-weekly basis and a quarterly advance and what that would mean. I am persuaded that the money for child-care fee relief is needed by 1 April. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, they should have known that; I agree with you. I said in my remarks that I think there is a question mark over bookkeeping and competency with respect to forecasting these numbers, but, to be fair, it would be easy for a few families to tip us over the scale on the total amount that is needed here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I reiterate the point: we are not expending new funds; the money has already been appropriated in other Bills and we are accelerating it for necessary and socially responsible expenditure, in the view of the Australian Democrats as well as the Government. Given the choice, as I said in my remarks on the second reading, I will still agree that there is sufficient scrutiny&mdash;unless the plan is to vote against the Estimates, as Senator McMullan has said&mdash;but the urgency of the need for fee relief for child-care, I am afraid, comes first with us. So the Australian Democrats will be opposing Senator Bjelke-Petersen's amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very brief because essentially I addressed Senator Bjelke-Petersen's amendment in my second reading response and at this time of night I do not wish to duplicate my previous remarks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank Senator Short for the manner in which he presented his remarks. He may have thought I was not paying due attention, but I did hear them. While I did not agree, of course, with all his points, I did appreciate the manner in which they were presented and I thank him for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take the question of accountability extremely seriously, as does the Government. Even though I spend many hours of my life going through the process, sometimes in debate with Senator Short, I think it is a very important one. I believe the process we have is the best balance of the competing factors available to us. I feel that the points that have been raised by honourable senators are important and, wanting to provide the maximum amount of information possible, I sought advice on the situation with regard to the Advance to the Minister for Finance, should this Bill be referred to a committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was Senator Short's understanding that at 30 March the balance on the AMF was $90m, which is broadly correct to the nearest million. It is assessed that at the end of March, with some anticipated requirements that have to be met, the balance would be $79m; the April anticipated requirements are $88m. So by the end of April&mdash;that is, if the Parliament fails to pass these Bills by the end of April, which is certain&mdash;the balance would be about minus $8m, with the anticipated requirements for May being $102m. So for each day in May that we fail to pass Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4), have we not passed Appropriation Bill No. 5, we will be running further and further into deficit and we will more and more have to make extraordinary adjustments to meet contractual requirements, or we will fail to meet them or have to adjust them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are important payments. Senator Kernot referred to the most socially important payments, but the others to which this Bill refers are also socially important payments. The child-care fee relief, because of the date of payment, et cetera, is most easily identifiable. Therefore it has tended to be the example that we have used in this debate. But I remind honourable senators that this Bill relates not only to child-care fee relief, but also to assistance for the aged and to labour market programs. So it is important that we recognise not only the accountability requirements, but also our responsibility to appropriate the money necessary to meet these socially important programs and enable the Government to meet its contractual obligations. For those reasons, I oppose the amendment of Senator Bjelke-Petersen. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That Appropriation Bill (No. 5) 1991-92 be referred to the Standing Committees on Community Affairs, Employment, Education and Training and Finance and Public Administration for consideration and report on or before Wednesday, 29 April 1992.</PARA>
<PARA>The reasons for moving this motion are similar to those I outlined in respect of Senator Bjelke-Petersen's amendment on which the Senate has just divided. The essential reason is that the Government's proposal completely stands on its head the procedure for the consideration and scrutiny of the expenditure of public moneys by the Senate and Parliament, which has been in place for many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate is being asked to pass Appropriation Bill (No. 5) in advance of consideration of its expenditure, totalling more than $204m, by an Estimates committee. Earlier in his remarks Senator McMullan referred to the item of child-care fee relief. He pointed out there was a need for a quarterly payment on 1 April, or very close thereafter. What he did not really explain was whether there are any alternatives to the unprecedented course of action being proposed here, which would enable that child-care fee relief to be paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, I believe I am correct in saying that he did not refer at all to the reasons for the apparent urgency of the appropriation of the other $140m which is the subject of this Bill, made up of $87m for labour market program assistance for job-seekers and industry, and $50m for residential care for older people. They are both very important programs. This debate is not about the importance of those programs; this debate is about the method of handling the consideration of the expenditure under these programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only one month ago the Government introduced legislation in the form of Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) to appropriate money for all of these programs. Suddenly, over the last four weeks the Government has tried to have us believe that the circumstances in relation to those programs have changed so much that unprecedented action has to be taken, namely, the amendment of Appropriation Bills Nos 3 and 4, which are currently before the Senate, and the substitution of those amended Bills by Appropriation Bill (No. 5). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McMullan queried some of the comments made and suspicions raised by the Opposition as to whether or not there is a link in this process between this legislation and the $317m bribe being offered to electors in advance of the Wills by-election which is to be held in a couple of weeks time. Whether there is a conspiracy or not, the suspicion lingers. Certainly, what is indisputable is that the Government has failed monumentally in the normal correct financial management of its affairs and is asking the Senate to bail it out because of its incompetence. In so doing, the Government is asking the Senate to overturn procedures for the proper scrutiny of public moneys which have been built up over many years, and of which the Senate is rightfully proud on behalf of the people of Australia. That is a disgrace and should not be tolerated. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

I would have thought that the vote of the Parliament was quite clear on this issue. The allegations of a conspiracy are unfounded.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish briefly to make two points. Firstly, if this proposal is carried we will have the silly situation where the same appropriations are being reviewed at the same time by two different committees of the Senate. The appropriations will still be before the Estimates Committee but, according to this motion, they would be before the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration as well. Estimable as the members of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration are&mdash;and in great part they are very worthy citizens&mdash;the need for them to duplicate the work of an Estimates committee seems to me to be entirely inappropriate. So I think it is a waste of time, and the arguments against it were effectively broadly put before.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I do want to respond to the reasonable part of Senator Short's questions concerning his request for a brief summary of the reason why the funding demand arises in line with the timetable outlined in the other two programs, that is, labor market programs and residential care for older people. They are very complicated questions and I cannot give all the answers now. I am happy to provide any further written information that Senator Short might want subsequently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, in the broad, we are in both instances talking about contracts. With regard to labor market program assistance, we have contracts with suppliers of training places which generally call for a proportion of funds to be provided in advance. An interruption to the funding would result in suspension of activity in labor market programs until the funding was restored. So the timing and amounts in regard to the suppliers of training places are contract driven. That is over-summarising the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the residential care, the funds required are estimated on the basis of the likely call for progress payments on contractual obligations arising from approvals for capital construction which are maturing from previous years. In both instances, I have over-summarised a complex argument. If Senator Short would like some further information, I am happy to provide it to him subsequently. But that is the core of what drives the timing and amounts, which will cause a problem if we were not to pass the Bills in the timetable as outlined. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened with interest to the remarks of Senator McMullan and I must say they were not at all convincing. To say that there is no point in referring Appropriation Bill (No. 5) to a committee because the appropriations that are contained in it are in Appropriation Bill (No.3), which is already before Estimates committees, just does not wash.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real question that has to be asked is: why is this mechanism being used to negate the appropriations in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and to reappropriate in Appropriation Bill (No. 5) when the additional money that the Government really requires, or appears to require, is only $40m; and why is it being used when there is $92m available in the Advance to the Minister for Finance? This would, for a change, be a proper use of the Advance. There are plenty of examples of it not been properly used but this would be an appropriate method of using it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During his summing up of the second reading debate, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) put a big emphasis on the fact that Treasury could not be expected to get it right all the time. My colleagues pointed out to him and to everyone in general that Treasury never seems to get it right; in fact, it is a long way out. Senator McMullan virtually agreed with what we had to say and said, `We can't expect them to get it right'. I wonder whether the Parliamentary Secretary can give me an estimation of how close Treasury should be. Last week people seemed to say&mdash;Senator McMullan included&mdash;that Treasury got the examination of the Fightback package pretty right. I think it was a mile out. When we come to the Appropriation Bills he said that it is not expected to get it right. Could he give me a brief run-down of how close it is supposed to be?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose the short answer to the question is no, but I will try to be a little more helpful. What we expect from Treasury when it brings down the Budget&mdash;not so much the Additional Estimates, although that to a lesser extent&mdash;is an explanation of the assumptions underlying the Estimates and the basis upon which the calculations have been made, so that we can challenge the assumptions and challenge the assessments.

He cops a fine under section 221DBY. The Western Australian Tax Office is sending them out by the hundreds this year. There was a downturn in the farming sector last year, the Government applied the 10 per cent uplift factor and then had to make a provisional variation. The Parliamentary Secretary said that there are a lot of unknowns. There are a lot of unknowns for those who adjusted their provisional tax&mdash;the final costs of putting another crop in and other final payments, some of which may come in before 30 June. The Taxation Office, which is controlled by the Government, will not listen to excuses; people just cop a 20 per cent penalty, or whatever it is, under section 221DBY. </PARA>

In terms of the Commissioner's administrative interpretations, he is independent of the Government&mdash;the Government has no capacity to direct him as to how it should be interpreted. As to why the law reads as it is, I do not think that is the problem Senator Panizza is referring to. I do not think the problem arises from the wording of the law; it arises from the administration of the Act. I see a lot of correspondence on this. There is a fair bit of flexibility about the interpretation of people's application for variation of provisional tax. I see a lot of examples of it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to talk about why the Appropriation Bill (No. 5) has not been referred to a committee. Before doing so, I refer to Senator McMullan's answers to Senator Panizza. I notice that twice tonight Senator McMullan has in effect said, `Well, it wasn't our fault; it was something that you did'. I have my grave suspicions that what Senator McMullan is saying is not right. I might say that that is a technique which has been adopted by the front bench of the Labor Party with great regularity. Whenever Senator Cook is found out to be wrong, he constantly says that the facts are different from what is alleged. However, today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> has pointed out that Senator Cook's allegations are not correct and that he is wrong, notwithstanding what he says.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noticed that before Senator McMullan responded to Senator Panizza he had a conversation with Senator Collins. I do not know whether Senator Collins prompted Senator McMullan along these lines. Senator Collins has thrice in the last three days of sitting denied that I was accurate in my questions saying, `Senator Lewis got it totally wrong'. On each occasion he has then gone on to confess that I got it totally right. I wonder whether the Labor Party has adopted, as a matter of general principle, that its first attack in response to a question which gets to the nub of the matter is to deny in some way or another the facts, the circumstances, and to tell us that we are wrong. That then makes it difficult for the media to report what the issue is all about because the Government has alleged that the facts or the circumstances are not as we have brought out. </PARA>

This is another chapter for the next book `Further Up the Greasy Pole' by our former colleagues Senator Puplick, Senator Macklin and Senator Black.

They confessed that the Democrats frequently knew what was in the Government's mind ahead of what the back bench of the Labor Party knew. Former Senator Black frequently did not know what was going on when former Senator Macklin did. Former Senator Macklin confessed that there were times when the Government Ministers went to the Democrats and said, `We don't want this provision, vote against it notwithstanding the fact that we will appear to be supporting it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this evening to put a number of happy facts before the Senate. This is a sequel to a matter I raised in this place on 5 March about a family of sugarcane farmers in Queensland who, as a result of drought and high interest rates, incurred farm losses and farm debt and the previously sorry situation in which that family found themselves in relation to their pension.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The senior lady in the family had her age pension cut by 85 per cent because QIDC household assistance support was categorised as income by the Department of Social Security. As a result, there was a sense of frustration and humiliation over the inaction of the Department of Social Security in relation to those changes to the pension. It was referred to them by me as a case of Mr and Mrs N who are sugarcane farmers in the mid-north coast of Queensland in Mr Courtice's electorate of Hinkler. The tale I have to tell is one from which every senator can take some heart. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that on 6 March or thereabouts, Mrs N received a telephone call from the regional Social Security office. I am very pleased to say that it was a kind, courteous and professional call about her pension. The upshot of the conversation was that her age pension had been reviewed and altered. Honourable senators may recall that on 10 October 1991, Mrs N's pension was assessed at $131.60 a fortnight, but it will now be $273.30 a fortnight. What is more, she was credited for the arrears and given pension entitlements. I am led to believe that that telephone call lifted hopes, restored faith in mankind and, what is more, provided hope for the future. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Welfare in Australia is now a big business, unfortunately. Australia now has some five million people receiving social security payments and a work force of some 8.5 million people. This represents only one and a half workers for every welfare recipient. Those five million plus welfare recipients include: more than 9.1 million families receiving family allowance for nearly 3.7 million children; nearly 200,000 low income working families receiving the family allowance supplement; almost 1.4 million age pensioners; another 30,000 spouses and carers receiving payments; more than 815,000 people receiving Job Search allowance or Newstart allowance; more than 75,000 people temporarily too sick to work, which is an incredible number; carers receiving payments of child disability allowance for more than 45,000 children; and more than 30,000 people receiving special benefits because they are unable to support themselves temporarily but are not eligible for any other type of support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is acknowledged that some of the recipients also work, but there is no denying the fact that, if welfare recipients wanted to form one united union or association, they certainly would be a force to be reckoned with. For example, imagine the fuss such a powerful lobby group would have made about the Department of Social Security's mistake regarding the mailing out of 6,000 notices of confidential income and bank account details to the wrong people. </PARA>

Anything out of the ordinary falls in the too-hard basket at the DSS. I am just pleased to say that Mrs N, although she may have been a statistic in the mainframe in Canberra and although she may have fallen into the too-hard basket, is one case which was handled by hand, handled satisfactorily, and that is why the DSS response to Mrs N's case was so much appreciated by me and her family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At Senator Walsh's invitation during his speech on the resource security legislation, I wish to respond to his comments regarding my predecessor's application for sickness pension. I wish to place my response on the public record to avoid wasting any further time in the normal course of speaking on particular issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, I am not absolutely clear what Senator Walsh's particular agenda is in this matter. If his concern is genuinely directed towards anyone perpetrating a fiscal scam, he should readdress his efforts to the due process of the Parliamentary Trust Committee whose task it is to ensure that everyone retiring receives their correct entitlements. My understanding is that the decision should be based on neutral principles which have already been laid down. Personal attacks and value judgments by Senator Walsh are as irrelevant to that process as my personal view that former Senator Vallentine deserves every bit of recognition she gains for the deep personal cost of her years of stressful parliamentary involvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I wish to remind the Senate of the following facts: it was suggested by the Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Colston, a member of the Parliamentary Trust, that ex-Senator Vallentine apply for a sickness pension following her decision to leave the Senate. Senator Colston approached ex-Senator Vallentine after hearing that ill health was one of her reasons for retiring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Former Senator Vallentine's work as a senator was a major contributing factor to her ill health. Her problem was of intermittent migraine attacks which increased in severity over time and caused a loss of 48 days in the last year. Although she was lively and well in between these attacks, they were totally debilitating when they set in and, unfortunately, were not predictable in their occurrence. This matter is a complex one for the Parliamentary Trust as it has implications for all other sufferers of intermittent illnesses as opposed to life threatening or permanently debilitating illness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, ex-Senator Vallentine has expressed herself as being `quite relaxed about whatever the Parliamentary Trust decides about my eligibility for a pension'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Employment, Education and Training has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Minister understands that some evidence was given that the MBA scheme was generating large surpluses which were used for the general purposes of the MBA. However, since the Commonwealth had no financial interest in establishing the MBA scheme, nor in providing funds for its administration, there was no diversion of Commonwealth funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Whilst the scheme was promoted by the MBA as a non-profit scheme, the Commonwealth had no financial interest in the establishment of the MBA group training scheme and is not aware of its status at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The Commonwealth understands that evidence was given to the Royal Commission that surplus funds, generated by the MBA scheme, were treated as profit by the MBA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The Commonwealth Government provides a contribution towards the administrative costs of a number of group training schemes involved in the building industry. However, the NSW Master Builders' Association Group Training Scheme has never been funded by the Commonwealth under these arrangements. With regard to other group schemes in the building industry, the Commonwealth contributed $2,830,492 towards administrative costs between 1987-88 and 1990-91. To establish the amount of Commonwealth contributions to these other schemes prior to 1987-88 would be a protracted exercise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Group schemes, as with other common law employers of indentured apprentices and trainees are eligible for and receive employer incentives under the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full-time Training (CRAFT) and the Australian Traineeship System (ATS) at current rates. This includes rebates of training costs, available under CRAFT, for group training schemes approved to provide off-the-job training courses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) Since the Commonwealth has not provided any contributions to the establishment costs or administration of the MBA group training scheme, it has not called for audit reports.</PARA>
