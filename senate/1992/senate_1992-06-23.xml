As foreshadowed yesterday, because of the interest and importance of this instrument I seek leave to make a statement about the Committee's actions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted.</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XG4">Senator GILES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances has recently concluded its scrutiny of the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1992 No.58, made under the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981. I reported to the Senate on 26 May 1992 on our concerns with this instrument, when on behalf of the Committee I gave notice of a motion of disallowance in respect of the regulations. Also, at giving of notices yesterday I incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> the correspondence of the Committee with the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) on this matter. However, this instrument raised issues of such interest and importance that the Committee considered that a more detailed statement should be made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The regulations were very short, substituting a new regulation 9 which provided that the standard of proof required before the Federal Police Disciplinary Tribunal is proof beyond all reasonable doubt. The only other substantive provision, which was not an amendment of the principal regulations, provided that the amendment extends to proceedings or matters which arose before the regulations commenced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The explanatory statement which accompanied the regulations advised that the previous regulation 9 was replaced by the new regulation 9 to the same effect because it was understood that the previous regulation was invalid. No details of the putative invalidity were provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee considered the instrument and decided to write to the Minister about three matters. Firstly, we wished to know why the previous regulation 9, which had apparently been in operation for seven years, was invalid. The Committee assumed that it was because it lacked the authority expressly inserted in section 76(4)(aa) of the parent Act in 1987. Secondly, the Committee asked for an assurance that the application of the new regulation 9 to proceedings which arose before this provision was made did not operate retrospectively in a prejudicial fashion. Such retrospectivity, unless it affects only the Commonwealth, is invalid under section 48(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 and is also a breach of personal liberties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, and most importantly, the Committee was concerned at the adoption of the criminal, rather than the lesser civil, standard of proof before the Disciplinary Tribunal. In its letter to the Minister the Committee observed that, given the nature of the relevant proceedings, the rights of the public may be better protected by the civil standard of proof, which is the balance of probabilities, rather than the criminal standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Justice, Senator Tate, replied promptly to our concerns, confirming that the Committee was correct in its assumption that there was no authority for regulation 9 until the amendment of the Act in 1987. Also, there was no prejudicial retrospectivity. The new provision applied only to AFP officers facing charges and technically the effect of the amendment was to provide a higher standard of proof in the future, to the benefit of those officers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to the standard of proof, the Minister advised that the purpose of the amendment was to rectify the invalidity of the standard in use since 1985, not to implement a new policy decision. The reason for the criminal standard of proof was that penalties imposed as a result of disciplinary proceedings can have practical consequences as severe as any criminal sentence short of imprisonment. In addition, many acts constituting a breach of discipline in the AFP would also be crimes. This was particularly significant, even in groups subject to disciplinary regimes, because of the confrontational character of much police interaction with the public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, where a crime is suspected and a prosecution initiated, any disciplinary proceedings are suspended for the duration of the prosecution. The prospect of a lesser standard of proof would inevitably discourage pursuit of criminal investigations. The Minister concluded by pointing out that the lower standard of proof could harm a member in ambiguous circumstances and that complaints against police may be not only an avenue of redress for the genuinely aggrieved but also a means for dishonest persons to raise doubts about police evidence or avenge themselves on an AFP member.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee accepted the advice of the Minister about the invalidity and the retrospectivity. However, while it regarded the Minister's explanations about the standard of proof as persuasive, the Committee decided to take advantage of the opportunity to hear the views of the Commonwealth Ombudsman.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, the Committee was briefed by the Ombudsman, Mr Alan Cameron, and by other senior officials of the Ombudsman's office, Sue Pidgeon and John Taylor. The Ombudsman pointed out that when the police complaints regime was originally proposed, the Australian Law Reform Commission suggested that the civil standard of proof then in operation before the Police Appeal Board should continue. This was a flexible, or floating standard, the degree of seriousness of the charge affecting whether the issue had been proved to the satisfaction of the Tribunal. The criminal standard prevented disciplinary authorities from pressing action where reasonable satisfaction was felt, but not beyond reasonable doubt. This encouraged an undue measure of caution when disciplinary proceedings are in prospect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Ombudsman also advised that, among the States, only South Australia now had a criminal standard of proof; the rest had the floating civil standard. While the Minister was correct in noting that there should be rigorous pursuit of any criminal aspects, an alternative of disciplinary proceedings at a lesser standard of proof and lesser punishments was better than no action at all. The criminal standard may be defensible when a member's career is at stake, but there is a much weaker case for this in less serious complaints. The higher standard of proof tended to undermine public confidence in the complaints procedure if action were pressed in only a small proportion of cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee was therefore faced with the dilemma of deciding, as the Ombudsman expressed it, the fine balance between the rights of AFP members under inquiry and the capacity under the legislation for a thorough and impartial investigation of alleged offences. Here the Committee had two compelling but conflicting arguments. On the one hand, the criminal standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt gave a high level of protection to individual police officers under investigation, while giving a lesser standard of protection to the broader interests of the public. On the other hand, the civil standard of proof on the balance of probabilities provides reduced protection for the individuals concerned but ensures greater protection for the broader public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After considerable discussion, the Committee took its usual course of action in cases where there is a difference between reasonable people about sensitive issues of personal and other rights; that is, that where there are two or more conflicting sets of rights to be protected, then the Committee will not insist on amendment of the relevant delegated legislation. Instead, as in this case, it will simply point out to the executive law maker the existence of the dilemma. Here, the Committee sent to the Minister a copy of a paper presented to us by the Ombudsman, `The standard of proof in police disciplinary matters', observing that its quality was such that it should be taken into account in any future review of this aspect of the regulations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating today the Training Guarantee (Administration) Amendment Bill 1992. This Bill seeks to amend the Training Guarantee (Administration) Amendment Act 1990 which obliges all employers with an annual national payroll of $200,000 or more to spend the equivalent of one per cent of their payroll on what is called `eligible training activities'. From 1 July this year that figure of one per cent will increase to 1.5 per cent. This is in fact a payroll tax of 1.5 per cent on every employer in Australia with six employees or more. In this climate, it is ludicrous to even contemplate continuing with a thing like this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill itself seeks to allow employers to include in their eligible training programs full time students at or above year 10 or its equivalent who are under 21 years of age and who are participating in a work experience program. It makes similar provision for full time teachers seeking experience in industries. The Liberal and National parties will not oppose the amendments proposed in this Bill, on the basis that there is no purpose in voting against something which will make less objectionable a lousy piece of legislation which is fundamentally flawed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The training guarantee levy, of course, is an unnecessary impost. As pointed out very clearly in Fightback, it is one of the taxes on business which will be repealed by a Hewson government. If it were not so serious, it would in fact be a joke to have a levy in Australia at this stage. It must have been dreamt up by a committee of pseudo academics who are totally remote from the people and who have no understanding whatsoever of the real world. That remark, I think, could squarely be placed as an adequate description of this Labor Government today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The business sector has always either trained people or sought trained people from other similar organisations, whether they be in the private or public sector. I can only assume that when this training guarantee levy was proposed the idea was that it would preclude people from actually going out and doing that. This is where this Government is remote from the real world, because it will continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has happened is that a whole new non-productive industry has started up in this country, which I doubt will contribute one iota to Australia becoming a clever country. I know that that particular point will be debated, but the sad thing about it is that it will never be known. I think that in itself is a failing of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have canvassed a number of businesses and have had varying responses, almost what one would call a straw poll. It seems to me that the responses have broken into two quite distinct groups. One group states that it has always engaged in training and the levy will make no difference to it whatsoever. In other words, all the levy does is quantify what these people do because of the particular business they are in. Add it all up and it comes in above the one per cent and, as from 1 July, the 1.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other and much larger group, mainly in the small business sector, claims it does not need to train. To avoid paying the Government the levy those people dream up, with a lot of lateral thinking, ingenious ways of engaging in training programs and, if they can, enjoying themselves at the same time. This is clearly a waste of resources&mdash;scarce resources&mdash;as the money wasted on useless programs could be better spent on improving the efficiency of the particular organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I and, I know, some of my colleagues have participated in giving addresses to structured training programs. In Australia they have taken the place of seminars. The point I would like to make is that, as long as the companies pay their fees for their particular people, it does not really matter whether they turn up or not. They have satisfied the Act. As long as the money is paid, they have done the job. Of course, this has become a subculture industry in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One business told me it decided to engage an expert on stress to accompany its members to a delightful resort on the Sunshine Coast of Queensland for a weekend, simply to satisfy this ridiculous training levy requirement. I might say that the report I got was worth repeating. Everybody had a wonderful time, including the expert on stress. No-one took it very seriously. They played a lot of golf; they did the requisite couple of hours lecture. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Sowada knows about this. She is aware of this sort of thing going on as well. No-one, as I said, was meant to take it very seriously, except one person who did. That person now insists on taking a 10-minute break every hour to relieve stress. I might say that that person's work colleagues have ganged up and are now demanding that that particular person be given the sack because he is not carrying his weight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned earlier that we have yet another non-productive service industry that has grown up around the training levy. Those doing the training are also obliged to engage in training programs&mdash;the trainers have to get the trainers in. This shows how these things grow at an exponential rate; it indicates how silly the whole thing can be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In March this year I asked the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) a series of questions on notice in relation to the requirements to spend money under the training levy. I asked what training programs the Department of Administrative Services provided for electoral staff. This is pretty close to home&mdash;it applies to our own electoral staff. I asked: in 1990-91, what was the nature of each program? When was the program held and at what venue? Was the program specific to the duties of electoral staff? What was the cost of each program? There were a number of other questions as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The answers that came back were quite interesting. I will summarise them; I will not go into the detail. Among other things, 62 computer user courses were conducted between 2 July 1990 and 28 June 1991 in the West Block building in Canberra. General office skills courses were conducted over the period in question in Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth and Hobart. I would have thought that one of the important things when engaging staff is a training program. Elected members or senators either engage in a training program with their own staff or employ people who have experience and they learn, one from the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the interesting thing about it was that the total cost to the taxpayers of this country over that period was around $700,000. I believe&mdash;and I do not think many people would not agree with me&mdash;that that is an absolute disgrace, and it is only indicative of the situation. That was taxpayers' money spent by the Department of Administrative Services on courses for our staff members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happens in the private sector? In this climate, the private sector cannot afford to pay that sort of ludicrous amount of money. As mentioned earlier, the guarantee levy is yet another tax on business. It is a payroll tax of 1.5 per cent on any business which has six employees or more. The limit is $200,000 per annum in payroll&mdash;it is indexed&mdash;and that equates on average weekly earnings to six or seven employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last few years we have seen record unemployment  brought about by this Government because of its policies. It is the recession that, honourable senators might recall, we had to have. I know that the Government gets very tired of us repeating that, but repeat it we will, over and over again, so that the people of Australia do not forget why there are one million people out of work and why over 30 per cent of young people cannot find jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole thrust of the Hewson Fightback package&mdash;the Liberal-National Party program&mdash;to recover the Australian economy is geared to fixing the problems brought about by the failed policies of this Labor Government. The major way of doing that is to remove the input taxes which apply to business. The only way we can get Australia back on track is to revitalise the private sector. We cannot have phoney jobs in the public sector because the country cannot afford it. Unless we have a growing, vital private sector which provides the wealth to pay for the public sector, the public sector itself will collapse. We cannot afford to pay for the infrastructure&mdash;education, social welfare payments for those in genuine need, health and all the other things&mdash;if the private sector is in trouble, and it is in trouble, with record bankruptcies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The thrust of Fightback is to remove those seven major input taxes, which include sales tax, fuel excise, payroll tax&mdash;a tax on employment&mdash;and the training guarantee levy that we are debating here today. The claim is made that by the turn of the century this will create some 2 million new jobs. How will that happen? If we remove the input taxes on business we make our businesses more competitive&mdash;not only in relation to the export market, which is essential, but also in relation to our import replacement industries. We cannot continue to go down the track of increasing our current account deficit and of increasing the amount of money that we owe to overseas people without the country collapsing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once we become more competitive on the export market and once we make our import replacement industries more competitive, industry will respond. When industry responds, it will mean more real jobs&mdash;not phoney or bandaid jobs. That is the only way that this country will get its economy back on track. The Government knows it and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) knows it, but he spends his time bucketing the Opposition because we have brought out a package that appeals to the Australian people. In fact, it is the only hope for the future of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The One Nation package has gone nowhere. Everyone knows that. It had a few Keynesian-type programs which were based on infrastructure. No-one would have disagreed with those if, in the process, they had made us a more efficient economy. But the One Nation package had no imagination or depth, and it will not do anything for the long term future of the unemployed in this country, particularly our young people. As I mentioned earlier, we will not be opposing this Bill on the grounds that we believe that it improves the legislation which, in itself, is fundamentally flawed. Because the Bill does improve the legislation, we see no point in opposing it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to discuss today the Training Guarantee (Administration) Amendment Bill 1992. The Australian Democrats will not oppose this legislation. Introduced in 1990, the training guarantee legislation imposes a minimum requirement on employers set at a percentage of an employer's annual national payroll. Currently, employers with a payroll in excess of $200,000 per annum pay one per cent of their payroll on structured training&mdash;and this is indexed to average weekly earnings. However, after July this year, this minimum expenditure will increase to 1.5 per cent. This applies to both the private and public sectors. Any shortfalls in funding are paid to the Australian Taxation Office and contribute towards additional training funding and not consolidated revenue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the Training Guarantee (Administration) Act 1990 as a means of increasing the level of skills and knowledge in Australia's work force. It is inappropriate for industry to rely on the public education system to train workers or to poach trained staff from other employers. The aim of the TGL is to ensure a more equitable redistribution of costs of training across all employers in Australia. It encourages businesses to meet their training responsibilities thus contributing to a more highly skilled work force and a more productive working environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes to the Act that are before the Senate today are mainly technical and incorporate recommendations contained in the Finn report, otherwise known as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Young People's Participation in Post Compulsory Education and Training</EMPHASIS>. The report sets new national targets for young people's participation in post secondary compulsory education and training while recommending change to facilitate the convergence of general and vocational education. The review emphasises the need for flexible training pathways to equip Australia for the twenty-first century. Integral to this is work place productivity and the update of skills and knowledge through training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The training guarantee legislation was introduced to facilitate this process by ensuring that a guaranteed percentage of all of an employer's payroll is spent on training. As Australia crawls out of recession, the attainment of skills and high levels of competence is necessary to our future well-being. Increasingly, career progression will be related to the attainment of high levels of competence, and the effects of award restructuring will be multiskilling, and more creative and adaptive workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The success of business and industry in this country will depend on the skills of employees and employers' willingness to invest in quality training schemes. Business profits from a more competent and, thus, more efficient work force. In return, however, business must contribute to the development of these skills. The training guarantee enables such a contribution to be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In line with the recommendations of the Finn report, clauses 7 and 8 amend section 27 of the principal Act to expand the definition of an `eligible training program'. The amendments provide for a period of work experience and practise for students and teachers to be an eligible training program. This amendment is consistent with recommendation 8.3 of the Finn report, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Commonwealth Government should allow employer expenditure on industrial experience programs for students and teachers as valid expenditure for the purposes of the Training Guarantee Legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>A vital link exists between careers, education and industry. The success of careers education is inextricably connected to industry interest. Employers ultimately benefit from the provision of good career education when they hire employees who are familiar with their requirements, and are hopefully committed to the career they have chosen. The Finn report notes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Industry has a particular responsibility for the provision of workplace experience for both teachers and students.</PARA>
<PARA>The amendments specify that in this provision students must be enrolled full time at a higher education institution, TAFE or a school, and must be above the level of year 10 or its equivalent. The students must also be under 21 years of age, thus emphasising the importance of vocational training for young people. Once these young people attain various levels of competency we are not to quash their hopes by offering exploitative and unfair wage levels that denigrate their skills and performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debate over the last week reveals the Government's nebulous policy on this issue of youth wages. If the confusion over the youth job summit is any indication, the Government's commitment to young Australians is, indeed, questionable. I might add that I find Minister Beazley's suggestion that young people should not necessarily be represented at the summit offensive, as would any young person in the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is this Government's lack of understanding about the issues confronting youth and its belated attempts to do anything about them which have led to drastic and unprecedented levels of youth unemployment. If the youth summit is to have any credibility at all, it must be more than simply a talkfest for big government, big business and big unions. There must be input from young people, the very people who will be affected by the kind of wage levels that the Government is proposing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsection 27(1) specifies that there must be an agreement between a teacher and the training institution, and the training institution and the provider of work experience. This agreement must specify the terms and conditions under which the teacher undertakes the work experience or practice, and the teacher must be a full time employee of the school or institutions at the time of agreement.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reading speech claims that this is `consistent with the aim of encouraging teachers to acquire industry experience and knowledge'. This amendment also quells some of the criticism industry associations have had about the perceived lack of experience of teachers in careers outside that of teaching. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a need for a nationalisation and coordination of careers education structures. According to the Finn report, this would encourage increased employer expenditure on industrial experience programs for teachers and students. Experience in industry for teachers and students offers an exciting contribution to the development of an enhanced and efficient work force. I believe this to be a valid and progressive use of the training guarantee levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 5 amends section 25 of the Act, inserting a further provision as to the meaning of eligible training expenditure and programs. This includes an amendment that expenditure on goods and services, of which training is the central purpose, is to be provided within 13 months from the time the expenditure is incurred. This time limit can, however, be extended by the Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 6 amends section 26 of the principal Act to provide for eligible training expenditure for travel in relation to an eligible training program. This is based on the number of kilometres travelled at a prescribed rate by a motor vehicle enabling an employee to attend an eligible training program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sections of the business community continue to have reservations about the TGL. The Business Council of Australia contends that the scheme is an impediment to flexibility in training rather than a stimulus to training overall. The BCA's alternative to the training guarantee levy allowed the Minister discretion over whether or not to accept a company's training guarantee. The alternative did not entail compliance on the part of the company, unlike the current legislation. It is this very compulsion that is necessary to prevent managers and employers from shirking their training obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The TGL, however, should not allow managers and top administrators to usurp the benefits of the training levy. We have all heard anecdotes about big business and small business using their training allocation as rorts. Large training organisations have sprung up in the past two years ever ready to take advantage of the training expenditure allocation to cater for the needs of middle and high managers instead of lower level workers. To counteract these rumours and to impress on the business and wider community the importance of the TGL, it is necessary to investigate these claims and moreover to scrutinise the allocation of training expenditure moneys in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The then Minister, the Hon. John Dawkins, indicated in his second reading speech on the Training Guarantee Bill in 1990 the intention of the Government to monitor this legislation and to review the scheme four years into its operation. I would argue that a comprehensive review of this legislation is warranted. It is essential that we determine how equitably training is allocated amongst the work force, and we must consider factors such as the participation rates of disadvantaged groups such as women, Aboriginals and disabled people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have concerns, as I said earlier, about the possible rorting of the training guarantee levy as there does seem to have been a proliferation of schemes, rorts and other devices which enable businesses to spend this money in a way which could not actually be said to improve the training level and skills of their workers. There have been a number of claims made in the media&mdash;a number of claims have been made to me personally&mdash;and I do believe that this training guarantee levy needs to be very carefully scrutinised when the Government undertakes its review over the next couple of years or so. At this stage we do support the training guarantee levy but we would need to be very strongly convinced, over the coming years, that the rorts that have been identified by many sectors of business and certainly in this Parliament have been cleared up to ensure that the training guarantee levy does exactly what it has set out to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surveys such as the training expenditure survey conducted by the ABS do not give an in-depth insight into the nature of training in our work force. It is fundamental to the success of the legislation and to meet our economic goals that a national training scheme be effective and beyond reproach. We need to be wary given that some businesses may see the levy as `an onerous regulatory cost that business has to bear', to quote the Metal Trades Industry Association. For this reason the definition of eligible schemes must be irreproachable and the possibility of rorts totally eliminated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are assured that funds collected by the Taxation Office will be placed in a separate trust account which is set up for the purposes of additional training for the Australian work force. A breakdown and wide circulation of this information would be appropriate. It is important that the Government be accountable for these funds, which are apparently distributed to the States and Territories after costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats support the Bill today, with a caution: we are acutely aware of the key role training has to play in boosting our country's productivity; however, it must be done correctly. The development of increased training pathways and more flexible delivery arrangements is essential to our economic well-being and should be encouraged through legislation such as the TGL. Employer expenditure on training is projected to grow over the five years from 1990 by 35 per cent. Important, too, is that the legislation be effective and provide the much needed boost to industry and business that the Government claims it will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To this extent, as I said earlier, we will be looking very closely at the operation of the Act over the coming months and hope that the Government does something to clarify and clear up the many concerns that have been raised about rorting of the TGL in the business and wider community. The Australian Democrats look forward to a review of the scheme over the coming years and commend this Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Acting Deputy President, this is another attempt by the Government to get its training guarantee legislation into good order. I do not agree that a review of the legislation would be of any value whatsoever. I suggest that the review be abandoned and, if the Government is serious about finding jobs for people in this community, that it stop taxing the people who are most likely to be able to provide them. The increase to 1.5 per cent of earnings will only mean that people will put off employees to enable them to survive and continue in operation. Employers will not want to do this, but they will be forced to do so as a consequence of the Government's actions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This levy descended upon business on 1 July 1990 and has now operated for two years. Just listening to the Democrats speak about the levy, it is clear that there are so many problems with it that a review to try to put it in order would be a further waste of money. It should be abandoned. It is interesting to read the second reading speech which was incorporated by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) when the Bill was introduced, because it indicates that the Government actually knows that there is a problem. If only it could see its way clear to try to solve it. The Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The scheme was introduced as part of the Government's policy over the last several years to develop the appropriate environment in which Australian industry can become more competitive internationally. A fundamental step in this process is the development of a highly skilled workforce which can adapt quickly to major changes in the economy.</PARA>
<PARA>If only it was actually doing something to try to achieve those objectives. The legislation that we are dealing with today&mdash;the Training Guarantee (Administration) Amendment Bill 1992&mdash;is an amendment in response to a document by the Australian Education Council review committee which was entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Young People's Participation in Post-Compulsory Education and Training</EMPHASIS>. The amendment allows the scheme to be extended to include training programs for full time students and work experience students who are less than 21 years of age, and, if the scheme is going to exist, they of course should be included in it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we are not opposing this amendment; we did oppose the Bill originally, but this at least adds to the people who, hopefully, will get some benefit out of it. It is effectively an increase in the tax that business has to pay. We keep talking about training. It seems almost as if the Government thinks that, if we talk about training for long enough, people will forget that there are people out there without jobs. But training for what? If the Government could tell us the jobs that are available for which people do not have the skills, it would get a more positive response, but that is not the case. Like the summit, it is a device to try to hide the fact that there are people out there in the community who are actually suffering. There are cases where no member of the family has employment. There seems to be no comprehension of the stress that it places on families to have one of their members unemployed&mdash;and, in many cases, more than one. There is stress on marriages and on relationships between parents and children, and all the Government seems to do is to manufacture devices to keep down the apparent number of those out of work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A person is not counted as being out of work if he or she is doing some voluntary work. One is not counted as being out of work if one's spouse is still in employment. It really makes one wonder just how many more than one million Australians are out of work. The Government keeps putting people into training programs and fancy schemes and hopes that the numbers will go away. They will not go away, though, until people have meaningful jobs, and the problem will not be solved in the way that this Bill attempts to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scheme has failed. I will briefly mention the areas in which I believe it has failed. The cost of record keeping has increased markedly, and these increases have been for the people who have had their own training programs over a long period. These people are now required to keep extensive records for the Tax Office and there are dozens of stories&mdash;anywhere you go you will hear this&mdash;from people who have run very good training programs in the past. The cost of record keeping has increased and in many cases has reduced, as a consequence, the actual expenditure on the training of individuals; they have had to divert resources into keeping records for the Tax Office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, it has been brought to the attention of some companies that the actual level of expenditure is greatly in excess of the minimum amount, and so these companies have been able to cut the cost to their businesses by reducing the amount of money they had been spending on training. Prior to that, these companies were happy to spend a certain amount. Now that the Government tells them that a lesser amount is appropriate, and in light of the cost of keeping records, the amount of money spent on training has actually been reduced. It has become a tax on jobs and has inhibited employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why does the Labor Party always get this sort of thing so wrong? It tries to talk about the right solutions but never gets it right. The bureaucratisation of the training process is amazing. It has become so formalised. Earlier, I think Senator Parer went through the schemes that operate and the programs that have been run. Who has actually benefited from them? There has been no answer. As long as the Government has a list of numbers, a list of the amounts of money that make it look on paper as though it is doing something, it thinks it will all be all right. It will not be all right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper on 30 April of this year reported that the Tax Office had collected $3.7m from 1,500 employers who had failed to meet their level of training expenditure in the year 1990-91 but that virtually none of the $3.7m would be spent on training. It would be spent between the Tax Office, the Department of Employment, Education and Training and the National Training Board to cover administration costs. Let the Minister, when he responds to this Bill, tell us that that is not the case and give us an itemised breakdown of that $3.7m. Let us be told that that is not correct and that none of it was spent on administration&mdash;that it was actually spent on programs designed to get young people into work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have referred to the fact that people have cut down on the actual amounts spent on training as they cannot afford to continue to do so. Reference has been made today to the proliferation of fringe training companies, to the training related meetings and to the events which have been manufactured, quite within the law and quite properly, to enable people to spend this money in a way which is attractive to their employees but which has very little to do with increasing the skills of the work force. I think that is a great pity indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Market research by the Tax Office has shown that many large companies have reduced their expenditure. The President of the Australian Institute of Training and Development was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 29 April this year as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the past companies that invested four to five per cent of payroll are now cutting back to one per cent. They were probably the people who are actually achieving training programs that were worthwhile.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard reference this morning to the expensive conferences that some managing directors have been able to attend, possibly of very great value to them. But I wonder whether this is the way we should be achieving that, if it actually meets the objectives. Sending managing directors to expensive conferences may be very worth while but it is not going to influence unemployed youth to feel that money is being spent wisely in terms of getting people into their first job, and that is what we should be aiming for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will also continue to criticise the lack of the exemption mechanism to take into account the structure of specific industries. What money should a farmer have to try to find to spend on training an itinerant fruit picker or a shearer? There does not seem to be any comprehension of the nature of some industries. It is just a blanket, across the board tax. Things like this make people realise that it really is a payroll tax, that it is only made to look as though it is training because of the name of the Bill rather than anything within it that is helping young people, in particular, to get their first job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a pity that we do not have time to discuss this in more detail. There are other Bills in this two-week program of a similar nature, taxing business. The superannuation legislation is yet to come. I would tell the Government to focus on jobs and not all these words that try to make it look as though it is doing something. The Minister, whom I quoted earlier, indicates that the Government is aware of the problem. Let us get down to finding real solutions to the problem of unemployment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Training Guarantee (Administration) Amendment Bill increases the scope of an eligible training program as recommended by the 1991 Finn report of the Australian Education Council Review. The Bill provides for work experience and practice for students and teachers to be included in an eligible training program of an employer, and this we welcome.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the original training levy has not revolutionised business, industry or training development in Australia. Granted, training spending has increased. A figure of $700m has been estimated to have been spent by industry and a high level of compliance has been achieved. The great shame is that the training guarantee levy, with all its related Bills, and this one before us today, has produced a training scheme that does nothing to change the old ways or bring about the so-called `clever country'. Australian industry is not more competitive, nor has distribution of the training effort become more equitable amongst employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the absence of any requirement to distribute the training expenditure amongst different categories of employees, the TGEAA may be satisfied by spending one per cent of annual national payroll to enable the managing director to enjoy an overseas conference at an exotic conference site, whilst spending nothing on any other employee. John Dymond, in the journal <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Taxation in Australia</EMPHASIS> of February 1992, writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian industry has long had a reputation for devoting significant resources toward executive conferences, whilst spending little or no money on improving the skills of the general workforce.</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill before us today does attempt in part to correct this bias by recognising the vocational and general education of young people by allowing the work experience and practice for students and teachers to be included in an eligible training program of an employer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill's requirement of the type of youth to whom it is applicable is very specific. This is where I have problems with the amendment. Full time students at or above year 10 of the New South Wales system or its equivalent who are under 21 years of age may qualify. I query this cut-off age of 21. With the Government emphasis on students continuing to year 12, many students are not entering vocational studies until after that age. I will use the Tasmanian situation as an example&mdash;my home State. The average age of our matriculation or year 12 students is 18. Add a possible four-year course of study to that and we have an age of 22. Thus, under this Bill, final year trainees in many cases would be over 21 and would not be eligible for the work experience claim by the employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One particular area of training which will be affected is teacher training. At the University of Tasmania, teacher training is a four-year course at the Launceston campus or a one-year diploma course after a preliminary degree at the Hobart campus. At both campuses, final year students participate in two major extended practical sessions of several weeks each, with the practical sessions seen as the major component of their final year of study. Considering the educational structure in Tasmania, it would be very rare to have a final year student under the age of 21 in these courses. Final year students are often regarded by the host schools as an asset to the normal teaching staff. However, under the present structure of this Bill I can see a situation developing where the younger students will be preferred and the training institutions will find it difficult to place these final year students, particularly those who are over 21. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that a better proposal, and one more in line with the proposals contained in the Finn report, would have been to target full time students who commenced study under the age of 21 and to allow the work experience to be included as part of the employer's levy until their course of study was completed. I hope that the Government can see fit to make this amendment. In this way, no final year students will be disadvantaged, their full training will be accounted for and youth will have been encouraged thereby to train. This would be a more correct interpretation of recommendation 8.3 of the Finn report, which targets the training of youth in full time study but which does not&mdash;I must emphasise&mdash;install an upper age limit of 21. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the training levy and now this one limited concession towards vocational training, Australia will remain and is expected to remain one of the least skilled countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development unless there is a definite change. We must bring about some change. But change will come about only when Australia changes the government at the next election and the coalition introduces its Fightback program, which amongst many other proposals will abolish this iniquitous training tax that is far too narrowly based and does not benefit the entire community. No longer will Australia be described as it was by the Deveson committee as `arguably at the back of the pack'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Meanwhile, until the next election this country and its business community will be inflicted with a tax which has significantly increased the burden on small business. The Training Guarantee Act provides for the maintenance of records of an extremely burdensome nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, given that expenditure incurred in developing and administering accounting and information systems in relation to eligible training programs qualifies as eligible training expenditure, an employer's liability to training can be met in large part simply by adhering to the onerous requirements relating to the recording of eligible training programs. In fact, the Act states that an `employer must keep records that record and explain all transactions and other acts engaged in by the employer' and that these records must be maintained for at least five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the recording is so cumbersome that one large private teaching institution I know of with a staff of over 100 teachers has reduced the teaching load of one of its senior staff members and has appointed him as a staff development officer purely to supervise the Training Guarantee Act. He is not a trainer. His sole role is supervisory. He is finding that he is spending a minimum of three to four hours a week supervising this and maintaining the records. This is not the conclusion of the recording process that needs to be maintained because those records from this teacher are then channelled to the school accountant who must assign a dollar value to the training that has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This institution, like many other good employers, has as a demonstrable, historical fact regularly spent several times its minimum training requirement on its teachers over the years well before the levy was introduced. Many of these good employers have voiced the opinion that if, they simply post external training invoices to a training account in the general ledger and then find that this general ledger balance exceeds the minimum training expenditure amount, they would have satisfied their liability to training and need not do any more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that is not so&mdash;the Taxation Commissioner will not allow this attitude. The official response at this stage is that very full and extremely accurate records must be maintained to support the minimum training requirement. This position is made worse in that the Commissioner considers that every employer who fails to record eligible training expenditure in excess of the minimum training requirement will still be committing an offence, despite the fact that he might have exceeded it many times, if he does not keep the detailed records of how and when that training took place, its nature and who was involved. It appears that the Commissioner is taking the same bureaucratic inequitable view of the Training Guarantee Act as he took with the substantiation rules of division 3F of the Income Tax Assessment Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been noted by several writers that the objects of the Training Guarantee Act would be better served if all training programs were, say, submitted to a registered industry training body or the National Training Board for approval.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr David Edwards of the Victorian Chamber of Commerce states that, while training schemes are beneficial, the Federal Government should be using the carrot rather than the stick approach. Mr Edwards believes that it is wrong to promote training as a form of taxation with tax penalties and believes that employers should be offered tax incentives to train staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summing up, I would like this chamber to note that this Government's attitude to training can best be seen by what is happening to the shortfall that has been lodged by employers who have not spent the required one per cent on training. I repeat the comments made earlier in this debate by my colleague Senator Reid: although the Australian Taxation Office has collected $3.7m from such employers under the training guarantee levy, it is expected that virtually none of the $3.7m is likely to be spent on training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been informed that the money is to be divided up amongst three authorities&mdash;the Tax Office, the Department of Employment, Education and Training and the National Training Board&mdash;to cover administrative costs.

The Bill will allow an employer to include work experience for students and teachers in an eligible training program. The Bill also makes some amendments and technical clarifications.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although these changes do improve the principal Act, the original legislation was very poorly thought out and was drafted in excessive haste. I do not oppose this Bill, but it is important that the Senate be aware of just how unhelpful the training guarantee levy actually is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Government's increasing resort to compulsion in the training area is counterproductive. Some firms spend much more than the current one per cent and, indeed, the proposed 1 1/2 per cent on training. An example is the Tweed River fruit processors on the north coast of New South Wales who spend 8 1/2 per cent on training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some firms are finding that they actually spend more than the compulsory level and have actually reduced their spending on training. The Managing Director of Drake International Ltd, Mr Rod Urwin, said last year:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At least 35 per cent of companies have cut back; around 50 per cent find they are spending roughly the same amount.</PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, this legislation, with its huge bureaucratic framework, really is aimed at only about 15 per cent. The General Manager of the Sydney branch of the Australian Organisation for Quality, Mr Len King, has noted:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a lot of evidence that smaller companies are not reacting; they are waiting for the problem to go away. The scheme has forced a lot of companies to assess how much they were spending, and the word has gone down: we are spending too much.</PARA>
<PARA>We must seriously question whether the ALP Government's obsession with compulsion is the most effective strategy in the training area. Successful countries such as Germany and Japan, which do not have compulsory schemes, have long surpassed Australia in the provision of training skills for their young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a culture, such as in Germany, which rewards and admires achievement and the attainment of excellence, there are clear, well resourced, well funded and industry recognised training schemes and a great diversity of training opportunities. In Germany, almost 80 per cent of teenagers&mdash;virtually all of those not attending universities and colleges&mdash;are undertaking some form of training course. Australia, which has a national average of only 21 per cent of young Australians receiving vocational education, compares very unfavourably with this. The OECD average is 50 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Professor of Adult Education and Executive Director of Training and Development Services at the University of Technology, Sydney, Professor Rod McDonald, has identified obstacles to achieving a better trained Australia. He said that we spend more on education than many OECD countries. So the problem is not how much money we spend on education, but how we spend the money. Professor McDonald provides solutions, but they are quite different ones from the professional trainer approach which is essential to the Government's training guarantee scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor McDonald says that training is the responsibility of everybody in an organisation. The major trainers are people like line managers, supervisors and shop floor workers rather than the full time professional trainers. He says that what we need is a work force that is both well trained and can train well. All it requires is a little imagination to deliver training when and where it is needed. The single most important skill for all workers is to learn how to learn. Nothing they learn will serve them forever. Workers need to learn to take some responsibility for their own training. The more the workers learn how to train themselves the more they can contribute to the company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In major banks, for instance, a terminal branch can deliver a mini-tutorial to a new teller if training assistance is needed. This is something that the bank provides but which the worker can use to train himself or herself. ICI Australia Ltd has turned routine plant shutdowns into training opportunities. Other manufacturers could follow this example when processing plants have to stop processing for maintenance. </PARA>

The University of Technology, Sydney, and Lend Lease training have developed a program that develops simple skills such as writing and working in an organisation through to preparing training courses, motivating others and using reflection as an aid to diagnosing their own training needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many businesses are engaged in training and it should be their responsibility to make the decision on what sort of training they give employees, when they give it to them and for how long. It should be an individual enterprise decision. The aim of the training guarantee levy program is to increase the overall level of training. But legislation that compels employers with a payroll above a certain level to spend progressively larger proportions of that payroll on training is inefficient and inequitable, in the same way that payroll taxes and compulsory occupational superannuation are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has sought to expand training provision in industry by the use of compulsion through this training guarantee levy. Compulsion inevitably leads to waste and poor allocation of resources, and obscures the absence of proper incentives for industry to undertake training expenditure. It is also illogical to apply the same rate across the entire spectrum of business activity. Take, for example, a carpet laying business which has very little opportunity for training compared to a computer firm which has much greater need to ensure that staff are constantly trained. A carpet layer would need to use much less than the one per cent or 1 1/2 per cent, whereas the computing firm would need to use a much higher percentage. Under the training guarantee levy both firms are treated exactly the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The levy is also imposed regardless of the profitability of the enterprise. It must be complied with even though the employer is not making a profit. This has become a major problem in difficult times such as in the current great recession. There needs to be some recognition of capacity to pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Large employers with training programs already in place are relatively unaffected, but smaller employers have been forced to divert funds from priority areas which they have determined can best develop their firms. Some employers have simply avoided expanding their operations so that they will not incur direct and indirect costs imposed by the Government training levy. The Business Council of Australia concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Skills formation should be market driven. Australia needs a more flexible labour market and the last thing we need is a costly bureaucratic apparatus which will create new kinds of inefficiencies for firms.</PARA>
<PARA>The coalition is committed to upgrading vocational training to make it more responsive to the requirements of industry and the work force. Achieving that objective will require closer cooperation between the traditional sources of vocational education, TAFE colleges and industry. It will also require that TAFE colleges be more closely integrated with secondary schools and universities within their own States as well as in other States. These processes have already begun, but they need to be accelerated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the same token, training can no longer be left to the unstructured, hit and miss, learn as you go methods of the past. We must set national goals which will embrace the needs of industry, business and commerce for specific skills and for specific training. These goals must be met by providers who are flexible and highly qualified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industry has a vital and expanding role to play in entry level training. There are already excellent examples of cooperation between industry, schools and training institutions to provide integrated training. There are many possible models, and diversity in approach is to be encouraged within a framework of national standards. Industry and community must have an important role in driving these developments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An excellent example of such an integrated approach is to be found in Taree on the mid-north coast of New South Wales. At one of the local high schools, a program has been implemented to allow attendance at school for five days a week, or school for four days and TAFE for one day, or school for three days, TAFE for one day and work experience for one day. This is a sensible program that goes a long way towards meeting the broad range of needs of the current student population, particularly with higher retention rates in high schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fightback will help to accelerate reform programs such as the one being carried out at Taree. We will reduce and eliminate the unnecessary tax that is the training guarantee levy, and we will provide an additional $450m for TAFE over the rest of the decade. TAFE has a central role in lifting the levels of skills of Australians. It is the largest provider of post-secondary education and training and has a particular role in relation to upgrading adult skills and providing courses for disadvantaged groups. TAFE must be flexible and supportive of the needs of local industry and must be able to provide the training courses that industry requires. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recognising the key role of TAFE in the national training arrangements, the coalition has undertaken to ensure that the growth of TAFE is adequately supported, and to this end undertakes to increase funding by over $450m over the rest of the decade, as I have already mentioned. The approach of the coalition to training is, therefore, very different to that of the Government. We vehemently opposed this legislation when it was first introduced. However, there are some benefits in the proposed amendments which include work experience for students and teachers in the eligible training program for the training guarantee levy. For this reason we do not oppose this <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"> </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the training guarantee levy itself is simply the wrong way to go about bringing training to the forefront of the Australian workplace and it completely ignores the fact that training and education must be interlinked. That is why the coalition will abolish the training guarantee levy, which actually acts as a deterrent to training in many cases. We will replace it with an holistic approach to training and education that will see an additional $3 billion injected into education and training over the rest of this decade. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These funds are one part of the Commonwealth's allocation to local government. The other part of the total funding to local government comprises financial assistance grants for general purposes which are untied. Currently, these untied grants stand at $719.7m. This part of the funding for local government is distributed by the Commonwealth Grants Commission between the States on a per capita basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the local roads grants&mdash;the ones totalling just over $300m which are dealt with by this Bill&mdash;are distributed not on a per capita basis but rather on a local roads needs basis. The percentage of moneys going to each State on the local roads needs basis is as follows:  New South Wales, 30.9 per cent; Victoria, 21.9 per cent; Queensland, 20 per cent; Western Australia, 16.3 per cent; South Australia, 5.8 per cent; Tasmania, 3.9 per cent; and the Northern Territory, 1.2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As this Bill provides for allocation on this basis, the percentages are the same as applied in the interim legislation which was dealt with by this Parliament last year and which in turn repeated the formula originally given in the land transport Act which used to distribute these local roads funds to local authorities. This formula gives a greater share of the total Commonwealth financial grant to Queensland, Western Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory than those States would have received had these moneys been distributed in the same way as untied general purpose grants&mdash;that is, on a per capita basis. As I mentioned, it relates to local roads needs. It is probably appropriate that those States with the greater burden of local roads do receive a slightly bigger share of the cake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was decided at the Special Premiers Conference of October 1990 that local roads grants, although specifically identified for local roads, would be untied. This, of course, means that local authorities can use them for whatever purpose they like, even though they are identified as being for local roads use. The coalition supports this principle as it is in line with the coalition's policy which supports a federal system to distribute power in a way which encourages participation and acts as a barrier against centralist, remote and authoritarian control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tied grants can blur spending responsibilities and accountability, and governments also tend to blame decision making errors on other levels of government.

There has been a suggestion&mdash;and I know this concern is shared by my colleague Senator Panizza who will be speaking later&mdash;that the moneys might be issued with a condition that they at least be spent on roads but without any other conditions or accounting responsibilities. However, at this time it is the coalition's position not to support any conditions at all on the allocation of these funds. On that aspect, we support the Bill as it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any case, my understanding is that most local authorities spend much more on their local roads than the Commonwealth grant. Therefore, the possibility that any councils will not use this money for their local roads is very remote, to say the least, although it is a matter which should be kept under consideration by the Federal Government. If it does not work out that way then it might have to be looked at again in the years ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned, the coalition believes that the best people to keep local governments on line and accountable are their own electors. I am confident, from my involvement with local government for more than a decade, that moneys allocated by the Commonwealth are spent responsibly at local levels and quite often more responsibly than when directions are given from the central government in Canberra. The States, having received the local road moneys that I mentioned earlier, will then distribute them within the States according to principles reflecting local roads needs. This will be done at the direction of the States Grants Commission on a needs basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the lateness of this legislation, it is anticipated that the distribution of grants by the States Grants Commission for 1992-93 will be the same as applied in the last year. The principles reflecting needs for the following two years will be worked out between the Commonwealth and the Local Government Association in each State in the early part of the implementation of this <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"> I believe it is essential that the allocation for the following two years continues to be worked out on the basis of local roads needs. </EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you Mr Acting Deputy President. I certainly do not blame the Clerks for that. As I say, we anticipated that this Bill would not start for another hour. The Clerks were moving along at the same pace as I was and were also caught at rather short notice. As I have indicated, I am not quite sure what the Minister's attitude to the amendment is. I had brief discussions with Senator Bell, and I understand that the Democrats might support the amendment, but again I will have to await their advice on that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment is relatively minor. I might say that anyone who cares to read the legislation and the amendment&mdash;although that might be difficult if it has not been distributed as yet&mdash;would see that it is very simple. It is obviously not simple enough for the Labor Party because the honourable member for Scullin, Mr Jenkins, in the debate in the other place, completely missed the point of the amendment. It makes me wonder just where Mr Jenkins might have got his advice from. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He seemed to think that the only reason we were moving the amendment in relation to Tasmania and the Northern Territory was simply to ensure that the Federal Labor Government had discussions with non-Labor governments in the two States. That his argument is so patently wrong is, of course, initially shown by the fact that if the amendment were for the purpose that the Labor Party suggested, we certainly would have included reference to the New South Wales Government, which is a non-Labor Government and is likely to be one, I might say, for many years to come. If that was the reason for the amendment, we would have also included Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and even Queensland, as those States will very soon have non-Labor governments. That will happen as soon as any of those current governments is prepared to go to the polls. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment really relates to the fact that legislation indicates that for the Northern Territory and Tasmania there will be a change in the percentage of Commonwealth funding going to States for local roads needs and local authorities for local roads needs. Currently, State governments have some responsibility for local roads needs where there are no local authorities in charge. The same amount of money will be allocated, but there is this proposal in the legislation to shift some of the money from the States for local roads needs to the local authorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reading speech indicated that the Minister will discuss with the State and Territory the variation of percentages that will go to the Tasmanian Government as opposed to Tasmanian local authorities. However, in my consultations with the relevant parties, they suggested to me that it might be better if that undertaking to consult with the State Government and the Municipal Association of Tasmania, and the State Government and the municipal association in the Territory, were enshrined in the legislation to ensure that the Government did, in fact, have to consult and could not just rely on the Minister's word. So the amendment is very simply put. We will deal with it in the Committee of the Whole and I urge both the Democrats and the Government to support it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also say at this stage&mdash;again, I have been caught a bit unawares&mdash;and I raised it with the Minister just recently, that from talking with the Tasmanian authorities this morning there is a suggestion that the amount up to which that change of moneys might take place, which in the legislation is $4.41m, should be increased to $5.193m. That, again, is by arrangement between the Tasmanian Government and the Municipal Association of Tasmania. Apparently the MAT had written to or faxed the Minister about that amendment. The representative Minister in this chamber did not seem to be aware of it half an hour ago, so I am having that second amendment prepared in case it assists the Senate. Whether I move it will depend on whether the Government is going to move it. Again, it needed to fix up this legislation for the benefit of the parties involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment to consult which I will move still leaves the final decision with the Federal Minister. He is required to consult. Having consulted, he then makes up his own mind, but the legislation requires him at least to enter into talks with the State and Federal authorities, which I am sure they would do in any case. For that reason I cannot see that the Government would have any objection to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The change in Tasmania, as I have mentioned, is occasioned simply because of the greater responsibilities given to some councils in some areas of that State. In the Northern Territory the change is occasioned by the fact that 52 additional local government bodies will be included in the local roads funding grants receiving a share of the money that was previously paid to the Northern Territory Government. A great majority of the new local governing bodies are Aboriginal communities which, prior to this, were excluded from this scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Northern Territory Government is happy with the proposals, although some finetunings are required to determine areas of responsibility. I understand that the Northern Territory Government is currently initiating talks with the Commonwealth in this regard. The amendment will ensure that the Commonwealth does consult before making decisions on the percentage to go from State government coffers to the local authorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reading speech to this Bill seems to be saying that funds relating to local roads needs are maintained in real terms. This is done by tying the quantum of local roads funding to local authorities to the general funding to States. In April 1991 this Government undertook to provide real term funding guarantees for the States. Through this Bill, they also pass on to the local authorities, but with a rider stating that it was on the understanding that Australia did not experience a major deterioration in its economic circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has obviously very cleverly built in this escape clause to that statement. The current Budget blow-out from an anticipated deficit of $4.7 billion to the now&mdash;that is, a week or so ago&mdash;projected deficit of $9.2 billion, would seem to me to be a major deterioration in the economic circumstances of Australia or, more particularly, of this Government's management of it. It very seriously raises the concern that maybe the Government will cut back on funding to the States and local authorities as it has done, in the case of local authorities, in the last several years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is of some concern to me. Local authorities should be aware that this Government's promises to maintain local road funding in real terms are subject to that rider. The conditions in that rider would seem to have been met by the massive blow-out in the Government deficit. So I have some concern for local authorities around Australia that that funding will, in fact, be maintained in real terms over the next three years.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill does not guarantee it. All it guarantees is that it will keep pace with the States and the States will only get the funding providing there is no major blow-out in the economic circumstance of the country. It leaves me with some concern as to whether what local government authorities think they are now likely to get will, in fact, eventuate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is looking at a deficit of something like $23 billion if all of its promises recently announced are to be paid for. Curiously, that $23 billion is very close to the $27 billion we intend to recover from the GST proposals as part of our Fightback package. It seems to me that the Government is manoeuvring itself to introduce a consumption tax after the election. It would not do it beforehand because it does not have the guts to do that. Its deficit is almost what we are going to collect from the GST, and it seems to me that the Government is setting itself up to introduce a consumption tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that the consumption tax is starting this week with the amendments to the sales tax legislation. Local governments are to lose their wholesales sales tax exempt status in certain areas because of this Government's sales tax legislation. It seems to be the first foot in the door for a consumption tax by this Government after the election, if it is extremely lucky enough to be re-elected. It is, I suppose, only academic because it will not be here, but the Government is not going to be game to do that. Mr Keating will have his way and introduce his 1985 preferred option of having a consumption tax to fund the $23 billion worth of promises that have been made. He cannot fund them and the only way he will be able to do it is by introducing a consumption tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is certainly introducing a GST, but the funds that we get from the GST will lead to massive personal tax reductions which we have identified for 95 per cent of Australians. It will mean that they will be paying no more than a marginal tax rate of 30c in the dollar, and as well other major savings will be funded. They will be paying a third less tax than they now do. In addition, there will be substantial reductions in personal income tax, as I mentioned, increased pensions for government pensioners of 8 per cent and other government benefits will go up by 6 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will be completely abolishing wholesale sales tax and the fuel tax, which means that there will be a saving of 26c per litre for businesses and local authorities and a saving of 19c per litre for private motorists. We will also be abolishing the payroll tax and the training guarantee levy, both of which currently impost very heavily on local authorities around Australia. As I mentioned, it seems fairly clear to me that the Government will be introducing the same sort of consumption tax if it is lucky enough to be here in any strength at all after the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Local governments will benefit substantially from the abolition of the fuel tax, the training guarantee levy and the payroll tax in those States which currently pay payroll tax on their water, sewerage and training activities. The savings that we will make to local authorities will be of great significance. I reiterate that the coalition will be cutting back Federal Government expenditure by a gross 10 per cent of existing current government expenditure. We will be paying some of that back in other benefits, but I might add that State and local governments will not be immune from the belt tightening which is needed to get Australia on the right path. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our current foreign debt of $145 billion, which has increased from $23 billion when this Government took over, needs to be addressed. This can only be done by reducing wasteful duplication, and triplication in cases, of government expenditure. Because we recognise that local authorities have been more poorly treated in recent years by this Government and that their real terms funding has fallen, we will not be slashing our funding to them to the same extent, but we will be making a 5 per cent cut across the board to State and local governments. That will be the contribution of State and local governments to the belt tightening which is needed. I repeat the point so clearly made by the Municipal Association of Victoria that the savings to local authorities in fuel excise alone&mdash;the fuel excise we are going to abolish&mdash;will more than compensate for the reduced grants to local authorities under our proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own community in the Burdekin Shire, on the last available full year's figures I have, the reduction of 5 per cent in the Federal assistance grant would be compensated more than twice over by the savings that council will make on the abolition of the fuel tax. I understand the situation is very similar right around Australia. Generally, the coalition has agreed to maintain funding at at least the current level on roads, but we will be doing this notwithstanding that we have completely abolished the fuel tax from general revenue. The private motorist will pay a GST of about&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I particularly welcome the recognition and acknowledgment in the second reading speech of the work of local government associations&mdash;in particular, the Australian Local Government Association. I think it is appropriate for governments and Ministers to acknowledge the work that is done by organisations such as this, whether they are industry organisations, organisations of other tiers of government, or community based organisations. We, as legislators, are very often remiss in not acknowledging the work those groups do. They are enormously valuable groups in the community and since the time when I held this portfolio the Australian Local Government Association and State local government bodies certainly have come into that category. It is good to see them acknowledged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those who may be glued to their radios wondering what has happened to the mysterious amendment over which there was some consternation a little while ago, it has arrived on the desks of honourable senators. Everything comes to those who wait, even Senator Macdonald's amendment. In that context, there had been some discussion between the coalition's office and the office of the responsible Democrat senator on this some time ago, but this is the first time we have seen the amendment as drafted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My advice, in the interim, has been that the amendment is not necessary.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . dependent on negotiations between the Tasmanian Government and the Municipal Association of Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA>So that part of Senator Macdonald's amendment is covered. I believe that the generality of it is covered, as Senator Macdonald acknowledged. I do not see the case of the Local Government Association of the Northern Territory specifically referred to in the second reading speech. Especially in light of the comments that I have already made, I would welcome the Minister, in his summing up, commenting on that part of Senator Macdonald's amendment and confirming that that body will be involved in the same way as the second reading speech acknowledges that the Municipal Association of Tasmania will be involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With that qualification, I do not see a real need for Senator Macdonald's amendment and I think that, listening to his part in the discussion and his explanation of it, he was a bit doubtful about it too.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main purpose of the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Amendment Bill 1992 has been spelt out already, but I will do so again. The Bill puts in place the decisions made at the 1990 Premiers Conference that funds for local roads be untied and paid at the same level to local government or State government via general purpose grants. Interim funding arrangements were provided for 1991-92 giving stability in the lead-up to the legislation being prepared. We all know how quick this Government is at getting legislation ready, so it has to have some interim position in place. Further funding arrangements are now set in concrete for the next three years, although in some cases there will be a loss of funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose there is one good thing about all this, and that is, the Government is locked into this three-year program. But, as Senator Macdonald has already pointed out, it has included an escape clause so that if Australia's general economic well-being goes down in the next three years, local government funding will suffer. Fortunately, we will be in government in far less than three years and Australia's economy will turn around before then. So I can say that local government can look to a better future. Local government funding will continue to be identified separately rather than absorbed with general fund assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us address the matter of untied grants. As Senator Macdonald said earlier, I have expressed fears concerning untied road grants. I must admit that I was rolled earlier. I thought I had the numbers but a certain chairman of our local government committee kept having meetings and my support eroded slightly as we went on. But I still have fears for these grants being totally untied. I believe in untied grants when there is specific funding for specific jobs. In Western Australia&mdash;and I presume throughout Australia&mdash;specific grants used to be tied to specific spots on the roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a local government applies for funding for specific spots on a road, it will get funding for those spots. The site is inspected by a Department of Main Roads engineer and the local government applies for funding for that site, which may then be granted. The application has to be very specific. An example would be an application for a grant for work on a particular five kilometres of a road. I am very happy to move away from that situation. There is nothing worse than doing a specific job on a road and the funds running out when there is, say, only half a kilometre to go. Local ratepayers could not understand why that was the case. The equipment had to then be moved away. A lot of money has been wasted shifting road plants in remote areas, as it may be that there are hundreds of kilometres between jobs&mdash;although moving equipment so as to finish a job is a good idea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I still have fears about untying grants completely. However, the legislation says that road funding will still be specified as road funding rather than as general grants, so I believe it is contradictory. I am happy to see how it performs over time. My fears are that different local governments will act differently. We have been told by Senator Macdonald and others that it is up to specific local governments how they spend their money and if a council does not spend it wisely then its local ratepayers will vote it out of office. That may be so, but it all depends where the local government is situated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I fear for local governments that are controlled by the radical green movement. I can name three local governments in Western Australia that are in that situation, though I will not name them now. One green organisation does not want any more development in the area that it is associated with. It is doing its best to keep that development to a minimum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There could be the situation where a local government does not spend money on roads and instead spends it on anything it wishes. As a result of the inconsistencies there will be a patchwork system of road standards throughout the States. Fortunately, these local governments that I have the greatest fear about are on the coastline. This means that they do not fit into the general arrangements for transport and roads across Western Australia. Nonetheless, there is a problem. In the next three years I look forward to seeing how this situation works out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each State will get road funding according to its particular needs. I believe that is the way we should head in Australia. New South Wales is going to have many headaches trying to work out where the most money is needed. I have never seen roads in such a shocking state. That situation was caused by the Wran Government neglecting rural areas in order to concentrate on inner city areas. In turn, a further problem is created. If we have a local government that is not spending money on roads then eventually its need for road funding will increase. That is a simple deduction. </PARA>

The Government is going to give those communities their own road funding and I wish to know how it is going to be spent. I have seen a situation in Kalamunda in Western Australia where the local Aboriginal community has been given three pieces of plant that any private enterprise contractor would love to have. They have been left idle after being used for only 20 or 30 hours over two or three years. That is an utter disgrace. Is the same thing going to occur throughout the rest of the country?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the north of Western Australia last week one local government told me about the problems concerning roads for Aboriginal communities. That group was concerned about how the funding would be allocated. It is expected that the community will be given a grant and then it might buy a grader or a truck. Unfortunately, it does not work that way. If the community is to be given money to construct roads, I believe contractors should be employed to do the work. It is not just a matter of having a truck, a loader and a grader, but the area has to be surveyed to find the best route, taking into account river crossings, where the materials will come from and so on. Those processes have to be undertaken. Engineers are needed to advise on those matters. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am forced to be brief because of the guillotine. I have only a short time available. To allow Senator Boswell to contribute something to the debate and to allow the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) to reply, I will be brief. There has been some criticism in this place this morning of the coalition's record on local government. Like my colleagues Senator Panizza and Senator Macdonald, our new shadow Minister, I have had experience in local government. I congratulate Senator Macdonald on his promotion. I can tell honourable senators, from my own experience, that on the ground, out there at the coalface where local government is doing the work and using the funds, the greater the flexibility it can receive, the better it is for local government. I commend the Government on this occasion for providing that flexibility in the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Amendment <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe the Government's record, over the last nine years, has been anything to crow about as far as local government is concerned. I remind Senator Powell, because she was critical of our Fightback package and the proposals for local government, that the thing that concerns local government, in my experience anyway, is consistency of funding and communication with the government of the day. I think in both cases this Government is at fault. In the nine years it has been in power what has it given local government? I hark back to the Fraser days, which are often quoted. In those days local government had financial recognition. Local government had a guaranteed percentage of personal income tax. Ask any person in local government, and he or she will say that the certainty of funding under those arrangements was far better than it has been in the last nine years. The Advisory Council for Inter-government Relations was disbanded by the Hawke Government. This forum was at least tackling some of the problems, which are still there, of local, State and Federal government relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators would remember the report put down in 1991 by the Commonwealth Grants Commission and its fiscal equalisation proposals that my colleague Senator Panizza talked about. After nine years we really have not got very far. We have had one report. The Commission wanted to do some more work on it, but unfortunately the Government could not find any money or the incentive to go on with it. During those nine years we had Mr Hawke vaunting his much advocated new federalism policy, but that has gone up in smoke with the change of Prime Minister. That has been replaced with an ad hoc State, Federal and local government arrangement a la Keating. I noticed only in the last few weeks that we are going back over the old story again. I noticed that Mr Keating is now talking about forming a council of local government&mdash;CAG for short. I expect that to be nothing other than another talkfest, as we have had in the past. It will be ignored under the new system of executive government which Mr Keating has thrust upon his Cabinet colleagues. We have had plenty of evidence of that in the last few days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As this Bill deals with road funding I would like to remind the Senate of this Government's deplorable record in relation to road funding. In 1982-83&mdash;when the Labor Party came to power&mdash;the total fuel excise per litre was around 6.5c. It is now around 26c per litre. In 1982-83, 4.5c of the 6.5c was returned to road users. In this day and age, 6.5c of the total 26c is going back to roads. As a direct consequence, Australian motorists are paying heavily to subsidise the vote buying of this Government, and our road network will continue to deteriorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been much said by motoring organisations, local government and State governments about our roads. My colleagues Senator Panizza and, in particular, Senator Macdonald have talked about the effects of Fightback and how the removal of the 26c per litre fuel excise will help local government, as will the removal of the wholesale sales tax, payroll tax, training levies and superannuation levies. I would remind those critics of the Fightback package of the assumptions made by the senior economist at the Municipal Association of Victoria; he has already been quoted by Senator Macdonald. We have the situation where, rather than there being criticism of the Opposition's proposals for local government, our record over many years of government has been one of support and reliability as far as local government is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All that local government has had in the last nine years is a very unreliable system of funding and a government that really makes a lot of noise about communicating with local government. But if we look at what has happened in the nine years there has been very little to show. It is somewhat of a change to be able to support the Government on this Bill because it does at least provide to local government some certainty of funding and some flexibility to local government in the use of funds. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bill we are debating today is the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Amendment Bill 1992. It formalises the arrangements for local government funding for the three years from 1992 to 1995. It is interesting to note that 82 per cent of the national road length of this country is the responsibility of local government. The provision of these funds, $300m, was previously administered under the Commonwealth assistance to local authority roads scheme, known as CALAR.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1990 the Special Premiers Conference decided that funds for local roads would be untied and paid to local governments or to State governments where they were responsible for local roads. That was done via a general purpose grant. It was decided then to distribute funds in 1991-92 under a set of interim arrangements reflected in the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1991. The present legislation is the culmination of exhaustive consultation between the Commonwealth, the States and local government. The Queensland Local Government Association and many councils in Queensland fought very hard to maintain the funding in the ratio that was decided upon. I refer to the proposals to depart from the historical practice of separately identifying the road element of local government funding within the general purpose grants. I am glad that the Government has backed away from this arrangement, and I hope that it is not only for this year. The passage of this legislation is a relief to many shire councils throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since October 1990 the future funding for local roads has been under review while the interim arrangements were in place. This has led to uncertainty, and the local councils are faced with drought and low commodity prices in rural Australia at the moment. They have struggled to balance their budgets, and even a modest increase in rates is a tremendous burden to their ratepayers. In many of the smaller shire councils 20 or 30 people may pay 90 or 95 per cent of the rates. To put rates up at this time puts a tremendous burden on those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation has some problems. The current formula for the distribution of road funding remains in place only for 1992-93; it is then to be reviewed for 1993-94 and 1994-95. Currently, the formula is based on a road length and population ratio: road length, 62.85 per cent; and population, 37.15 per cent. The current road length formula does not discriminate against unsealed roads&mdash;the majority of the roads in remote rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is under pressure from both the cities and the large urban councils to vary this formula in favour of the more urban councils. Such a transfer of funding from rural councils would be devastating in the current rural recession. The cities have more significant rate bases and an $800m better cities program. I believe the way that the road funding will be distributed in the next 12 months is very fair and everyone should accept it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Senator Powell has not had circulated yet a second reading amendment to this legislation, so I forewarn people that it may be on the way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reading the debates on this legislation, both in the House of Representatives and the Senate, made me draw a very rare conclusion, one that I have always shied away from, and that is that the debate in the House of Representatives was second rate, tacky, not on the subject and generally did not add much to debate on the sorts of principles that are involved in this <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"> It is for once to the credit of the Senate that many of the principal issues have been addressed from a wide diversity of viewpoints. Senator Knowles and Senator MacGibbon probably represent the extreme view at one end, through to Senator Spindler and Senator Chamarette at the other. But all address the broad principles of the Bill, as did my colleague Senator Teague, who I apprehend has just come into the chamber. I congratulate them for addressing the principles of this <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"> </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to turn to two or three areas. There is a general view around, especially expressed in the House of Representatives but partly reflected in Senator MacGibbon's speech, that this Bill was a result of the Gulf war. Let me say once and for all that that is not the case. A Senate committee, including the distinguished Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Hill), came up with the report on these matters referring to conscientious objection which was published in 1985. It is true that the Government took about a year to respond to that report. It took another couple of years for it to finally trickle through in the Defence Department that legislation should cover this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I became Minister I made inquiries&mdash;and this was before the Gulf conflict&mdash;as to where the legislation should stand. I must say that my inquiries in all this were pushed along by Senator Tate, who has an office opposite me and who, every month or two, asked for a progressive report on how the drafting was coming along. I would have to say to him that this is not the most central legislation in terms of timing that Defence had at the time. Priority had to be given to other areas. However, to the credit of the legal people in the Department, they were able to draw up this Bill, which covers other matters which I do not think are contentious. I think we could say that the remaining contentious area of the Bill centres on conscientious objection and the provisions relating thereto. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the timing of the Bill had nothing to do with the Gulf war. It had nothing to do with anyone's misperceptions about multiculturalism&mdash;nothing whatsoever. I know I am simplifying it, but there are two central points of disagreement in this chamber. The Opposition argues that there is no need for a provision within the Act where one can apply on conscientious grounds to a specific rather than a general conflict. It is the Government's view that we need to put this provision in the Act to cover that very small percentage of people who take their objections to a specific conflict. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would prefer that this Parliament lay down the conditions&mdash;the criteria&mdash;for that sort of objection than let the courts go into some new merit making review process that binds us all. Both sides to the argument agree on one thing: we do not think it will be used very often because conscription almost inevitably will occur and only occur if the mainland of Australia is threatened. I cannot say any more than that. But certainly this side of politics has given that assurance, it is in our Party platform and that is where we stand on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I have had no assurance from those opposite, I suspect their general attitude in this modern day is that conscription would be necessary if the mainland of Australia were attacked. Under those circumstances and given the criteria we have put in the Act, it will not be easy to object in respect of that specific conflict. One would have to have a longstanding belief and there are three major conditions. So we hold our ground. Nevertheless, I respect the position put by the Opposition that its view is not based on any opportunism or any flawed philosophy as such. But we disagree on that issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is disagreement on the 90-day rule. Reading the House of Representatives debate, it became absolutely clear to me that what was being proposed was not understood. Again, this is not of any massive moment either way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then come to the proposed Democrat amendments&mdash;certainly the arguments put by the Democrats&mdash;to give volunteer service persons the right to opt out of a specific conflict. I have to say that I draw the line there. There is no way that this Government can support that proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When people sign up to go into the Australian defence forces, they do so in the knowledge that they could be involved in any number or any type of conflict. If at the point they are ready to sign up they believe that they cannot subscribe to or entertain becoming involved in some conflict, they should not join the armed services. But having gone to the enormous cost of training personnel and giving them general support&mdash;supplying everything from superannuation through to dentistry; the whole range of areas&mdash;we cannot be put in the position of being told, `Although we have accepted all those benefits, we will not do our expected duty'. That is the fundamental decision that is made at the time someone signs up and it is not to be made afterwards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we are involved in what we might call lower level conflict where conscription is not involved, service men and women can be exempted for a variety of reasons. They can be exempted on practical grounds&mdash;not on the grounds of a conscientious objection&mdash;from going to such a conflict. It may well be that a spouse is extremely ill. We do not force people to go overseas if they wish to be exempted on those sorts of grounds. But service personnel cannot opt out at the point we commit people to Cambodia, the Gulf or whatever other United Nations sanctioned operation we are involved in. The Government will rigorously oppose such a proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In one sense this is a unique day for the defence debate in this country. Today the Opposition has announced that it no longer supports a bipartisan defence policy. I have no quibble with the Opposition about that. I find it strange that the Opposition made this announcement by way of press release in an address to a Sydney electorate rather than through a party room discussion. I wonder whether there has been a party room discussion on this point. Nevertheless, the Opposition has decided to end bipartisan defence policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This decision will mean that Bills such as the one we are now considering may well be debated in a different atmosphere in the future. One paragraph really stood out in the press release which announced the end of the bipartisan approach. Mr Downer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . defence was not just about stopping small groups of foreign commandoes in Zodiac rubber boats throwing hand grenades at remote homesteads in northern Australia. It had to be more fundamental than that.</PARA>
<PARA>Well, by gee, it has to be a lot more fundamental than that. It has to be more fundamental than putting out inflated costs on service bands and calling for their abolition. We have to have a decent debate in which real figures can be discussed. It is not good enough to put out figures quoting the lowest possible Army presence in the Northern Territory, ignoring reservists, Air Force and Navy and totally ignoring the move north of 2 Cavalry Regiment and a brigade by the end of the decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I regret to say that we will now have some abrasive debates on defence. I hope they will be on the right issues. I hope that those debates will concentrate on the real substance of defence and not on the trivia, but I suspect this will be beyond the Arthur Daly of the shadow Cabinet and that, in fact, we will get the sorts of press releases we have had ever since he took over the shadow ministry. That is not to say that that will reflect on any job he will do as a future Defence Minister if, indeed, he ever becomes one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a great difference between being an Opposition spokesman on defence matters and a Minister. I understand the difference. I understand the polemics required to retain one's position, to impress one's peers that one is being active and to be the greatest nuisance that one can be&mdash;in fact, to some oppositions, that shows that some progress is being made. I think that is true of all portfolios, but it is less true of the Defence portfolio because many of these issues go on into the future no matter which government is in power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In those circumstances I will be quite fearless in analysing some of the past opposition-government defence policies, but I will not be callow about it. I will never fail to acknowledge some of the great defence policies produced by conservative governments. I still believe the decision to purchase the F18 was one of the most fundamentally sound decisions ever taken in this country. I note that during the massive defence cutbacks in the United States&mdash;where government expenditure on defence will go from 27 per cent to 16 per cent by 1995&mdash;there will be no fresh orders for planes except for 300 F18s. </PARA>

I hope that, when we get to taws about defence, some of the sensible defence decisions made by this Government will not be dragged into the mud. When one gets into government one sometimes realises there is a degree of sense about such issues. As I say, it is interesting that for the first time in many years the Opposition defence spokesman said in a press release:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will sum up the issues at hand in this <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"> The legislation, of course, goes to several very practical points. It puts ACPERS on a particular committee and it sets out defence superannuation issues, most of which I think are agreed in the chamber, and I certainly do not think these will be the last amendments of this sort in an omnibus <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"> </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The central issues, however, are conscientious objection and conscription. Now is a very sensible time to discuss these issues, when there is no prospect of having to do either. Now is a sensible time to lay down these principles, not in the heat of a potential conflict or an involvement overseas, and not at a time when there might be a very heated and emotional debate. I do not think any of us at the moment consider conscription to be likely in the next few years, so this is the time to lay down those principles to guide people into the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay tribute to the committee work done in the Senate in 1985 which forms the basis for most of these recommendations. I suspect that at the end of the day the Opposition and Democrat amendments will fail, and that there will be a bit of a Mexican stand-off with the Government being in the middle. Nevertheless, all sides in this chamber can probably live with these provisions because they are far more precise. No-one in this chamber disagrees with doing away with the classes of call-up which existed from, I think, 1913, if not 1901, which, to say the least, were chauvinistic, racist and sexist&mdash;totally out of the way of modern thinking. All those particular classes are gone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the day, when this particular Bill seeks passage through the chamber we will be in a position where most of us, at least, will be able to say that it is a reasonable <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"> We have minor disagreements on these two clauses: that is, the Opposition disagrees with being able to object to a specific conflict, which I think is the major objection, and there is a minor disagreement over the 90-day rule. In the end, given the Democrats' concern expressed during the Gulf conflict&mdash;a concern that I was critical of because I thought it whipped up unnecessary rumours and other things&mdash;they can now be a lot happier with the way the Bill is cast in terms of specifics, appeal rights for conscientious objectors, et cetera.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the allegation about what Kim Beazley, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, said, he did not say at any point that young people should not attend the job summit. I have in front of me a transcript of an interview with Kim Beazley in Cairns on Monday, 22 June 1992. In that transcript there is this question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Weren't you quoted yesterday as saying that it wasn't appropriate or wasn't necessary to have youth representatives at that summit?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There then follows the answer:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think the point I was making yesterday, was this. That what we need now is a statement from people who are capable of providing employment as to how they propose to do it. Whether or not young people are represented at the summit, the most important thing is we do know what young people want&mdash;they want training, they want jobs, and what we've got to do is to get from business as from Government training and jobs.</PARA>
<PARA>At no point did Kim Beazley say that young people should not be at the job summit. He said that the most important thing&mdash;and I think this will enlighten the debate a little&mdash;is that representatives of government and business should be there to talk about how jobs for young people should be created. That is the most important thing. We all know as a fact that young people in Australia want jobs and want access to training.</PARA>

We certainly want to hear the experiences and frustrations at, if you like, the consumer end of the market. But, quite clearly, the most important objective of this youth summit is to look at and gather from the community whatever ideas business, unions, the community aid sector and others can put forward to assist in the improvement of youth employment.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know why Senator Bishop is shaking her head in a negative way. I would have thought that this was a good piece of news.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce to last week's CAI and Westpac June survey of industrial activity in which respondents said that business conditions over the next six months are expected to be better than at any time since 1988. I ask the Minister: firstly, does the Government's research support this expectation, and, secondly, are these survey results relevant to the claims about the capacity of industry with payrolls over $1m to absorb the initial one per cent of the superannuation guarantee charge?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4298" SPEAKER="Button Sen The Hon J.N." NAMEID="4F4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, TECHNOLOGY AND COMMERCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In answer to a question last week I talked about the CAI-Westpac survey of industrial trends. The survey is more optimistic than since 1988. The press statement from the Confederation of Australian Industry and Westpac stated that `the worst appears to be over for the manufacturing sector' and that manufacturers `now expect new orders and output to stage a recovery'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kernot asked me whether this is consistent with Government forecasts. I would be hesitant to say that, except to say that most Government forecasts and available information suggest that a slow recovery is in progress and confirm that it may be better for the manufacturing sector than some other sectors of the economy over the period in question. For example, the March quarter national accounts showed GDP growth for three consecutive quarters, housing and private consumption spending is showing clear signs of growth, and so are retail sales and housing approvals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think that the optimism of a short term business outlook means terribly much for the superannuation guarantee levy. After all, the superannuation guarantee charge is a structural reform which will improve retirement incomes and national savings over the longer term. That is to say, it is not a question of comparing the next six months with the longer term benefits which will accrue from the superannuation guarantee levy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is sometimes said it is never the best time to address underlying long term issues facing Australia. That is a failure of the `she'll be right, mate' culture at all levels&mdash;government, business and unions. Short term crises all too often crowd out action to address the structural problems facing the economy, such as, for example, the youth unemployment issue, which has been the subject of questions here today and during the week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government does not resile from addressing this issue and from ensuring that the SGC addresses the important issues of adequate retirement incomes for an ageing population and improving the savings performance of the economy. There is no point in making false promises about that or coming up with fake solutions, as some political parties tend to do. The Government and the Democrats have agreed on a timetable for the implementation of the SGC. It is designed to ensure that firms will be able to absorb the costs with a negligible impact on employment. The Democrats are to be congratulated on the great amount of time and work they have put into their position on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is expected that wage increases will take into account the increased superannuation guarantee contribution, and industrial relations legislation will be amended to require the Industrial Relations Commission to give consideration to the SGC in its determination of wage increases. It should also be noted that the increase in the SGC over the decade is a fraction of expected productivity improvement as we come out of the recession and that it can be absorbed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should add that another important consideration in all of this&mdash;and one which has been important for some time&mdash;is that the Government has a wage policy that has succeeded in restraining real wage costs. It will continue to do that. It is unfortunate that in addressing this issue the Opposition does not have such a policy. It has a recipe for industrial anarchy, and one which does nothing to improve the standards of living of ordinary Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, in terms of the short term outlook, I think the Westpac-CAI survey material is encouraging. I hope that material will be built on in future surveys and show a longer term trend improvement in the economy. In so far as the SGC is concerned, it is Government policy that it should go ahead anyway as a longer term structural reform.</PARA>

These sorts of structural changes, historically, as far back as one likes to go, are traditionally opposed by employers for a variety of reasons.

That requires a massive investment in training and education. Since coming to office in 1983, we have increased expenditure on higher education by 42 per cent in real terms. We have created the equivalent of 17 new universities. In terms of the One Nation statement, we have made a commitment to training for technical and further education of $720m. That compares with Dr Hewson's consumption tax package of $75m in technical training.</PARA>

It is directed at making Australia world competitive. The fact that it has a massive beneficial impact on unemployment is a favourable outcome, not an unfavourable one.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct a question to the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support. I refer to the welcome improvement in Australia's waterfront productivity being achieved under the Government's reform program. How does this productivity compare with the performance of ports in New Zealand?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Waterfront reform in Australia is now demonstrating real gains, efficiencies and reliabilities, particularly since the move to full enterprise employment at our major ports. At this point I should pay tribute to my colleague Senator Collins, who presided over a very successful era of waterfront reform in Australia. What has that period of office achieved? More than 4,200 employees have exited the industry, which represents a 43 per cent reduction in the work force. By the end of the reform program later this year, the work force is expected to be effectively halved. This is well beyond the net reduction of 2,000 employees originally recommended by the Inter-State Commission's waterfront report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It compares favourably with the New Zealand reforms, which have also seen an overall reduction of about 50 per cent in employees on the New Zealand waterfront. Our container terminals have improved container handling rates by between 60 and 80 per cent. Australia's productivity rates in handling containers are comparable with those in New Zealand. For instance, the average container crane rate in Auckland is 18 containers per hour, which is the same as the average across Australia's major ports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Intense competition between our stevedores induced by the reform program has resulted in container handling charges for new business and contract renewals being about 30 per cent lower than they were last year. This means that the stevedoring charges on containers in New Zealand and Australia, as far as they can be reasonably compared, are now similar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is some need for further attention in the area of port authorities. Concerns have been raised recently regarding the higher level of port costs in Australia compared with New Zealand. This is primarily a matter for State governments. However, the current inquiry by the Industry Commission into port services and activities is expected to shed light on the validity of these comparisons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is an outstanding record of reform and improvement on the Australian waterfront. But, of course, it is not good enough for the Opposition, which is hell-bent on downgrading this country in the eyes of its trading partners. It is supposed to be Her Majesty's loyal Opposition, but it is not an Opposition loyal to the interests of Australia. New Zealand is the big icon for the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that the shadow Minister for shipping, Mr Sharp, recently claimed that the Australian reform program is a fundamental failure compared with New Zealand. I wish he would get it right. Mr Sharp has used the wrong data. He has used trans-Tasman shipping report data which is now outdated. The report's information was collected well before the radical restructuring of our stevedoring sector was fully implemented and before the achievement of the significant productivity changes to which I have referred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The allegations of the Opposition are not only disloyal but also based on wrong data to create a false impression and to undermine the confidence of the many Australians who have worked very hard to achieve these significant reforms. I wish the Opposition would find out the facts before condemning this country.</PARA>

In relation to the meat substitution racket, if this relates to certain documents which I understand Senator Lees tabled in the chamber late last week, I do not think there is any general evidence of revival of the meat substitution racket in those documents. But the Government is well able to make proper policy in relation to those who might be involved in abattoirs or meat processing plants in Australia for export and well able to make proper decisions based on up-to-date law enforcement intelligence, and that has been undertaken. That is all I wish to say on that matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Lees raised the question of wildlife smuggling and the netting of birds and so on. I understand that some of the documents Senator Lees tabled in the chamber late last week related to incidents which were alleged to have occurred back in the 1970s and early 1980s.

If Miss Cumming has any further information which could be useful, I would be most appreciative if she would forward such information to my office where she can be assured that it will be dealt with in the strictest of confidence and passed to the relevant authorities which might be able to help with further investigation if it was merited.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I answered a question from Senator Crichton-Browne on this subject on Friday. After the question he took note of my answer and we engaged in a small debate about it. Perhaps it is worthwhile making a number of very small and quick points about that. Hamersley Iron entered into an agreement with its unions in 1982. Part of that agreement was to recognise the obligation on people employed by Hamersley Iron to be a member of a union. The legislation was introduced into the Western Australian Parliament in December 1982 by the then O'Connor Government, which removed from the Industrial Relations Act that section of the Act which enabled such an agreement to be registered. As a consequence, the terms of that agreement were eliminated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I make about that is this: what we are seeing played out in the Pilbara, unfortunately, is a damaging dispute which has national implications and implications for our balance of payments. It is a dispute being conducted under laws enacted by a Liberal government and not under laws preferred by a Labor government. It is therefore in microcosm a reflection of a conservative view of how industrial relations should be conducted, not how industrial relations should be conducted from this Government's point of view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the question to me is: do I support the rule of law? That is almost an offensive question. It goes without saying that of course I do and, as a responsible Government Minister, I have an obligation to uphold it and I do. I support the rule of law. In this case I do not agree necessarily with what the law says because I think the law is wrong and I understand the circumstances which have caused the dispute to occur. Nonetheless, there is a fundamental obligation to obey the law and change it by constitutional means. I do support the law and I enjoin those who are on strike in the Pilbara to comply with the direction of Commissioner Fielding and return to work and enable the matter to be settled by other means.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I understand as the current status in this dispute is that the Deputy Industrial Registrar at Karratha in the Pilbara is investigating ways in which the matter might be resolved.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this case, the law is quite explicit: no-one can take action against an individual if he does not wish to be a member of the union. If action is being taken against such an individual, the onus of proof is upon the person against whom the allegation is made; in this case, nominally that would be Hamersley Iron. So there has been a shift in the onus of proof to the defendant, and not to the person making the allegation. That is what the law is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, I support the rule of law and seek always to change it by constitutional means. Were the Legislative Council in Western Australia not gerrymandered and elected by one vote, one value, the law would have changed long ago by virtue of the incumbency of the Labor Government in Western Australia. The law remains simply because the legislation is unable to be changed by the Government which commands the treasury bench and which is the Government of the State. It is an example of the Government being in government but not in power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, Senator Crichton-Browne is asking another matter again. He is asking: what is just? In my view the law is not always just. If I had the option, I would change the law and make it just. In this particular case, there is the right of the individual, which I recognise and acknowledge. There is also the right of the 2,000 other individuals who have negotiated their agreement with Hamersley Iron and achieved for themselves, by virtue of that negotiation in what is a typical enterprise agreement, a set of rates and conditions upon which they have also managed to function. They say that their rights, as a collective group of individuals, are endangered by someone freeloading on the basis of picking up the conditions and achievements that they have reached, and they believe that there ought to be an obligation on freeloaders. I understand that point of view. But in these circumstances I return to my reply: I enjoin those unions in the Pilbara to abide by Commissioner Fielding's direction to return to work and enable this matter to be sorted out by the processes of the Deputy Industrial Registrar in Karratha.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Has the Minister seen an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 15 June which states that many women are worried that workplace bargaining will undermine the gains that have been made in the workplace? Can the Minister explain how the Government's reforms to the Industrial Relations Act, recently passed through the Senate, address the concerns that women workers have about workplace or enterprise bargaining?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I saw the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> article. It appeared on 15 June, as Senator Giles has said, and was written by Julie Lewis under the heading `Why women fear a hard bargain is being driven'. The problem here is one of brand differentiation. When the Government says workplace bargaining, we mean a different set of propositions from what the Opposition means when it says enterprise agreements. In the public mind there is a tendency to blur those differences. I would like to differentiate between our brands so that women workers and women entrants into the work force can understand why their rights are protected and their move to pay equity is supported by this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Typically, women workers are streamed or locked into low paid jobs, or what is called women's work. Of course, this is changing under this Government. Nonetheless, there is a fear of what happened when the Fraser Government came to office, when the gains that had been made for women workers under the Whitlam Government slipped back again. We intend to continue to make some changes to provide better efficiencies in the workplace. We are concerned that things be not only best but also fairest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our changes to workplace bargaining ensure that women workers are protected because there is a fundamental condition that the value of pay and working conditions in workplace agreements cannot be contracted below the amount in an Industrial Relations Commission award. Thus, the minimum standards set by the Commission are an effective floor to the process of workplace agreements, and they ensure no exploitation of women workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also made a substantial commitment to skills training in Australia. For the first time many women workers have access to training and for advancement through higher levels of skill. Therefore, their pay inequities can be addressed. We will also continue with the national wage case. The national wage case makes economic adjustments for all workers in Australia annually. The position of the Opposition is to abolish the national wage case, to put general economic movements beyond the reach of ordinary Australians. We will continue with it because it is a way of protecting the interests of women workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the same way, in our workplace agreements there will be a dispute settling provision which will require that those agreements are voted on by all workers in the workplace, meaning that on many occasions, for the first time, women workers will get a vote on their conditions of employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are good examples of where this is already working. I gave details of the National Australia Bank's employment flexibility provisions the other day. The ANZ Bank has followed in its footsteps. The question of workplace bargaining is one in which we look to achieve economic efficiency&mdash;that is, best outcomes&mdash;but we want it to be fair as well. We do not want just best&mdash;we want the best and fairest industrial relations system. That is the one the Senate approved of just last week, as I am sure the House of Representatives will later this week.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) in response to questions without notice asked by Senators Colston, Crichton-Browne, Knowles, Parer and Vanstone this day, relating to education, employment and industrial relations.</PARA>
<PARA>I have sought leave to refer to those answers because they were in response to critical questions that were asked by honourable senators not only from this side but also from the other side in respect of both employment and productivity. In Australia today unemployment is running at some one million people. Of great concern to people on this side is the high level of unemployment among our youth. No matter what questions have been asked, the Government has deliberately evaded answering them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cook, in response to questions from Senator Knowles, took great umbrage at the fact that he was referred to as the `Minister for unemployment'. I cannot think of a more appropriate name to be given not only to this Minister but also to members of this Government, because they are the ones that created the unemployment. They have not come up with any answers. The Liberal and National parties have come up with a program that relates simply to looking at unemployment in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Colston compared the position on the wharves and in shipping in Australia with that of New Zealand. That came about because of a question I asked Senator Cook last week, not about the number of containers handled on our wharves, because there certainly has been an improvement in Australia, but about the actual cost of moving those containers from the wharf to the ship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question I asked Senator Cook last week&mdash;and he had no idea of the answer, although he is supposed to be the Minister responsible&mdash;was about a reduction in cost of a mere $4 per container in Australia, from $282 to $278, whereas our New Zealand counterparts are benefiting from a reduction of $132, from $298 to $166. In response today, Senator Cook said that a report of the monitoring of trans-Tasman shipping prepared by the Australian Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics and the New Zealand Ministry of Transport was outdated and did not reflect the benefits that have flown from improvements on the waterfront, yet that report was released by Senator Collins on 21 May this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other question I asked Senator Cook last week was how much idle labour is still being paid for on the Australian waterfront. To date we have not had a response, but I understand that it is in the order of $400 to $500. If that is the case, it is an absolute disgrace, because we have had this enormous amount of money paid out not just by the stevedoring companies but by the Australian taxpayers. The amount of money which has been set aside is in the order of $300m. In any other industry, that would not be paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that I think is worth drawing attention to is that time in and time out we have had the Minister for Industrial Relations come in here and say how great industrial relations are in Australia and what a marvellous improvement we have had. As honourable senators might recall, he went to Japan. My heart went out to the Minister for Industrial Relations when he went to Japan to explain to the Japanese how good things were, because I have been through that particular exercise myself. I say this quite sincerely because it gives me no joy to talk about the rotten reputation we have overseas in respect of industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent official Government document talked about the good job that Senator Cook had done in Japan and how he had convinced the Japanese that things had changed in Australia&mdash;how good they were. What do we have now? We have one of the major suppliers of commodities to Japan&mdash;Hamersley Iron&mdash;on strike. Two thousand people are on the grass because one particular person was found not to be a member of a union. Do honourable senators know how it was found that he was not a member of a union? There was a show day when all employees had to show their ticket, and one guy did not have a ticket. This is a hang-up from the old Broken Hill days when people had to come along on a certain day and show their union ticket, and no ticket meant no work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Can honourable senators imagine explaining to the tigers of the east&mdash;whether it be Japan, Korea, Taiwan or, more recently, Thailand&mdash;that one of Australia's major commodity suppliers is out of work because a person elects not to be a member of a union? Yet we get the Minister coming in here and we have had this Government coming in here time and again saying that there is no such thing as compulsory unionism in Australia, but that we do have closed shops&mdash;not compulsory, mind you! We had Senator McKiernan saying that the strike was not the union's fault at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everyone knows that what the union has done is against the law in Western Australia. As the Minister said, he does not like the law. That is fine, but what damage is being done? I say this from the point of view of employment and productivity. If we are to get out of this incredible mess that we have got into, we must export more. In the process of exporting more, we must employ more people. We must also get into more import replacement. These are the real jobs. They can be created only by the private sector. There is no other way. The way to do it is to get our productivity up, to reduce the unit costs of production. It is not a matter of wages, as I have said in this place time and again. Our wages are about half those in places such as Japan, but our productivity is lousy; it is more than half the Japanese productivity. Unless that is addressed, we will not get the investment we need in the export producing commodity areas or any other export area or in import replacement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The acid test is what people with some money would like to invest in in this country. We do not have to go to the ABS statistics to find out what is happening; we have only to get out of the ACT and talk to people in other places such as Townsville&mdash;Senator Reynolds is from there&mdash;Brisbane, Perth or Hobart and ask them what they are investing in. They are not investing in primary production, minerals, manufacturing or tourism. Those moneys are not being invested there. While they are not going there, we will not improve the wealth of this country; we will not increase exports or import replacements; and, more importantly&mdash;this is the thing that really matters&mdash;we will not improve the dreadful unemployment rate, particularly among the young people in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently the Minister came in here with a piece of legislation that was a direct result of the so-called Troubleshooters case. The Minister and the ACTU were coy. The ACTU and the committee investigating the matter had a wonderfully convenient loss of memory. When I asked them whether this was initiated by them as a result of the Troubleshooters case and whether it was after the Troubleshooters case that they spoke to the Minister and said, `We would like legislation', we had two gentlemen from the ACTU look at one another and say, `Look, we don't really remember this. We're not too sure'. `Do you remember talking to the Minister about this'? `No, I don't remember talking to the Minister about that'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What a convenient loss of memory. Of course that is where it came from. The sad part about it is that we have very few industries in Australia that are productive. One of them is the home building industry. The Minister is shaking his head. He does not agree that the home building industry is productive. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are very few industries that, on a world scale, we would consider to be efficient or productive. If there were, we would not have the balance of payments problems or the unemployment problems we have in Australia today. Everywhere I go I hear, `We have the most efficient X industry, Y industry, Z industry in the world'. We all hear it. I know that it is a good idea to lift people's morale and spirits; I really support that to the hilt. But I question whether it is really true that Australian industries are productive. Some industries appear to be productive because we happen to be blessed, say, with good resources or with a climate that is suitable and so on. But when you take it back to the productivity, the output, the unit cost of production, we are not really that productive. We have a long way to go.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have two very efficient industries. One is the home building industry and the other is the transport industry, where owner-drivers operate their own vehicles. This legislation, brought in by the Minister at the behest of the ACTU, was geared to make it easy for the unions to take the money and incorporate these people within their particular union, whether it be the BWIU or the Transport Workers Union.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that the Minister is that naive. Maybe he is. One clause in the legislation says that the unions may&mdash;or words to this effect&mdash;change their rules so that they can take contractors as members. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We know they do now, where they can. They use a browbeating method to do it. Everyone is aware that attempts are made by the Transport Workers Union to incarcerate owner-drivers within the Transport Workers Union system. Often, at any time in a production line&mdash;if you want to call it that&mdash;or a chain, there is a closed shop at one end or the other. A person who owns a vehicle turns up and the heavies say, `Unless you are a member of this union tomorrow do not come to pick up the newspapers', or whatever it might be. In the past those people have been able to argue strongly, `No matter how much we would like to'&mdash;they do not really want to, but it has been a wonderful way out&mdash;`we cannot because we are contractors; we cannot be owner-operators and members of a union at the same time'. This gives them the out to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own home State we have temporary construction sites. One recent site was the Indi. In a couple of weeks&mdash;and this is typical of union approaches&mdash;there is a knock on the door by a bunch of heavies who say, `We have declared this a construction site'. The small subbies on site say, `What does that mean?' The answer that comes back is, `It means you have to join the BLF'. The BLF still exists in Queensland because it was considered by the government of the day, strangely enough, as being a good union. I suppose that might have been relative to the BWIU; I have no idea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What they want, what they demand and what they get is that the subcontractor has to pay money to the union coffers. Once he pays that money, the union goes away quite happily. It has got the money. That is what this is all about. It is about making it easier for those sorts of people. I do not put them into some sort of ideological bloc somewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would not in any way like to cast aspersions on the Minister because, in the main, he probably does not engage in these practices or he probably did not. I do not know about that. All I know is that he would be aware that these practices go on and it is phoney to pretend they do not. The Minister has become the laughing stock of Australia. He is the laughing stock of every brickie, carpenter, electrician, plumber and plasterer in Australia. </PARA>

If they were to have a good effect, we would support them, but they will have the effect of forcing those people to be unproductive. They will force those people to get less money than they now get, to work fewer hours and to join organisations against their will. That is the important thing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from the contractors finding themselves in a difficult position, the net effect on the consumer, whether that consumer be the person at the other end of the truck or the person paying the bill to build the house, will be increased costs. These costs vary from place to place and they have been estimated to be as high as 15 per cent to 25 per cent, which would add about $20,000 to the cost of a normal house. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that a lot of my colleagues wish to speak on this matter, but it is important to put it all into perspective. We have to direct our attention to a better, more efficient and productive country. For instance, I notice that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)&mdash;and this was referred to in Question Time&mdash;has called a conference and that that conference will be held in private. A fascinating aspect of that conference is that, according to a press release by the Prime Minister, its purpose is to invite participants to a national meeting on youth training and employment. Guess who one of the participants is? It is Mr George Campbell of the AMWU. People may say, `What does it matter whether it is George Campbell?'. Is he not the same person who three years ago the Prime Minister of this country, Mr Paul Keating, referred to as the person who had the blood of 100,000 unemployed people on his hands? But George Campbell will be a participant in a conference called to discuss youth training and employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, we will have the usual gaggle of ACTU participants amongst all the others&mdash;the Bill Keltys, the Bill Mansfields and so on. The rest of Australia does not understand this perpetual hang-up between the Labor Party and its industrial arm, the trade union movement. Looking back over the last 10 or 20 years, the group&mdash;one can have a whole lot of people in the group such as the Christopher Skases, the Allan Bonds or whatever; the failed entrepreneurs&mdash;which can take the greatest share of responsibility for destroying the productivity of this country, for bringing it economically to its knees and creating the unemployment we have, is the short-sighted trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not talking about a number of trade unions which do not fit that category, but there are a lot who do. I am talking about those unions that go down the track of short-sightedness by doing things which on their face appear in the short term to be beneficial to the members of a particular union but which then force the more moderate unions to follow suit and show their own members that they can be as gung-ho and as militant as their comrades up the corridor. The effect is that jobs are lost. That is not just my opinion. It is also one held by most people who have thought this through. Whenever wage increases are at a greater level than productivity, it is inevitable that we have associated with it reduced productivity and increased unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Fightback package we are offering a number of things. We are offering to get rid of all those input costs, and I will not go into that now because it is not related to the matter in hand. That is very important if we are to make this a more productive country, if we are to make our industries more competitive, if we are to increase our exports and get into more import replacement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing is that we must have a deregulated labour market. That is the sticking point between ourselves and the Government. It is the basic difference between us, as was pointed out by Senator Cook during Question Time. It is our belief&mdash;this is a belief which has been shown to be correct in just about every other successful country in the world&mdash;that if we are to get out of the mess we are in we have to get rid of those restrictive work practices that were imposed in better times by militant trade unions. Senator Cook will recall, and I am sure he will admit, that at any time that is discussed it is said that many of those restrictive work practices will have to go. Some have gone already, but not without cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this is raised by various people with trade union leaders they inevitably come back with that old nineteenth century answer, `We are not about to give up hard won gains'. It is the standard response. Yet those hard won gains have cost hundreds of thousands of people, in fact almost a million people, their jobs. Commonsense needs to be used. At the time those gains were achieved, the unions may have thought they did a good job. When there was over-full employment, one could probably argue that they did but, when those gains were obtained at a rate where there was no equivalent productivity increase, it was inevitable that we would face the situation we are in today where a million people are out of work. With this Government in power, there is no light at the end of the tunnel. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Parer has moved to take note of various answers I gave to questions from the Opposition and from my side of the chamber during Question Time. That is a device under the Standing Orders which enables him to speak to the answers that I gave. Apparently this afforded Senator Parer the opportunity to practise his oratory and debating skills and to perambulate a few prejudices around the chamber about industrial relations. If it served any practical purpose, it may have helped Senator Parer. If it has, I am grateful, and I do not resent taking up the time of the Senate on these frivolities because of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of what Senator Parer has said is dross, but amongst the dross are one or two gems. One of the gems he uttered, and with which I concur absolutely, is that as a government we are about making Australia a world competitive economy. Our vision for this economy is for us to be a world competitive, global economy producing high value added manufactures, moving away from being a supplier of agricultural commodities and mineral resources to the world, the rawest form of export, and importing sophisticated manufactured goods. We want to move this economy to an economy that does not simply export coal and iron ore, wheat and wool, but that exports those sophisticated manufactured goods. In order to do that, structural change in this economy is necessary, and we have embarked on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although there is a world recession and a collapse in prices for our agricultural goods, which have had severe effects on the Australian economy, nonetheless an economic recovery is gathering in the Australian economy. Anyone who is prepared to be fair and reasonable and who can look with a dispassionate eye at the statistics produced by the ABS will see that the signs of that recovery are manifest. They are shown in an increase in housing starts and approvals for loans for housing construction; they are shown in an increase in the number of motor vehicle registrations, indicating that consumers are buying cars and other whitegoods for housing; they are shown in an increase in the number of advertised vacancies according to various indices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a recovery that is beginning; it is a recovery that most Australians welcome; it is a recovery that is the answer to the problems of unemployment in this country. But it is a recovery that has this adverse political effect for the Opposition: the stronger it becomes and the more effective it is, the less chance the Opposition will have to win an election. The Opposition knows that. As a consequence, we find this effort to damage the confidence so necessary to fuel that recovery, to downplay the significance of the statistics and to talk about doom and gloom instead of concentrating on the positive measures that are occurring. That macro strategy has been the strategy of the Opposition over recent weeks. Today's foray is a subplot of that macro strategy; that is, to single out the area of industrial relations for particular criticism and to concentrate on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me deal with some of the criticisms that have been made and reply positively on behalf of the Government, giving the truth about industrial relations. If one compares our performance to the performance of the Fraser Government, one can see that the period of the Fraser Government was epitomised by a high level of industrial disputation, by a wages explosion in the economy that disoriented the axis of the economy and by high unemployment. The Fraser Government achieved the trifecta: double digit unemployment, double digit inflation and negative economic growth all at the same time. There was also a high level of disputation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The features of the economy at the present time include very low industrial disputation, 60 per cent below that of the average of the Fraser years and, in the most recent returns of the Statistician, off the bottom of the graph&mdash;in fact lower than what the Statistician has collected since he or she commenced collecting those statistics. On the inflation front we are looking at a year average of 1.7 per cent. We had double digit inflation under the Fraser Government in its recession; we have very low levels of inflation in ours. We are coming out of the recession into economic growth. We have a very high level of unemployment which is the last factor which will come right. Through the initiative of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), we are now moving into a job summit for the young unemployed to deal with an area of concern in unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dare I say&mdash;it will probably be unpopular if I say it and I may be criticised for saying it&mdash;that, in terms of a fair analysis of what the unemployment problem is, the highest area of priority is not youth unemployment. I know that is contrary to what is often said. But the highest area of need among the unemployed is among those who are middle aged, face redundancy and do not have marketable skills which fit them to take a place in the economy when it lifts. That is the group in highest need; that is the group that is most neglected in popular political debate. I say that because I think it is essential, if we are to debate these matters, to talk about the situation and not simply exploit the statistics for political reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one compares programs, the Government has a series of opportunities for training, for training in place of the dole, for work experience and for job placement. As I said during Question Time, we have invested $720m this year into technical and further education and we have increased expenditure on higher education by 42 per cent in real terms over the term of our period in government, creating the equivalent of 17 new universities. So we are trying to address those problems of training and skill necessary to achieve our vision of a world competitive economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition&mdash;which presided over a high level of industrial disputation, divisions in Australia according to whether one was a worker or an employer, the politics of hate and resentment and the politics of envy&mdash;now lectures us that all the problems of the economy are due to unions or the work force that they represent and that ordinary Australians have been too greedy because wages have been too high. That is a fallacy of the first order; wages have been restrained over the nine years of our Government. It is a pretty pathetic effort to try to blame ordinary wage earners by saying that their wages are the cause of the present recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It has to be said&mdash;and let me say it now as strongly as I can&mdash;that the ordinary wage earners, the ordinary, average Australians, have conducted themselves in a way of restraint that has been a model for any other economy in the world. That is a compliment which they ought to be paid and for which they ought to be recognised. They do not deserve to be criticised as though they are greedy. It is not they who were greedy: Christopher Skase was greedy; Alan Bond was greedy; all the heroes of unrestrained capitalism, to use the proper technical definition, were greedy. But it was not the ordinary people of Australia who were greedy, and criticisms of ordinary people in this context are totally unfair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coming to the particular points that have been raised in this address by Senator Parer&mdash;which no doubt will be parroted by the familiar litany of faces on the Opposition benches, who simply cannot look at the Australian work force and recognise that some Australians want to be in trade unions and have them represent their point of view&mdash;</PARA>

As a fundamental question of good human management, I ask: do we get people to work together, to cooperate to achieve that goal, by confrontation, by demand and by insistence that they do things&mdash;which is the fundamental principle of the Opposition's industrial relations policy&mdash;or by cooperation, working together and the development of a team ethic?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The period of the Fraser Government was marked by division and confrontation. The so-called Fightback package, more accurately described as a consumption tax package, sets as its central goal `labour market reform', but no-one has explained and nor has John Howard said what those words mean. There is no detail to define the meaning. What we do know is where inspiration is drawn from by the Opposition for so-called labour market reform. It is drawn from across the Tasman in New Zealand. It is drawn from the APPM dispute. It is drawn from examples of confrontation and conflict. Those opposite must understand that they will get a better Australia when they work with Australians, not against them. Our industrial relations policy is one that concentrates on working with the progressive forces in the Australian community to achieve change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the waterfront, which is part of what Senator Parer addressed us on. Senator Parer, in a question to me last week, took statistics that had been compiled up until May of this year and tabled by the Minister on 21 May, which painted a picture of past circumstances and what they showed. He then used the picture of the past to condemn the present and to argue that reform on the Australian waterfront was not at the same level as that in New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know the Opposition is fascinated by New Zealand and wants to go down the New Zealand road. A weird side light of all of this is that, as Australians, we find we have a cultural cringe to New Zealand. Nonetheless, the fact is that Senator Parer's figures are wrong. What he did not do in the little exercise he engaged in was take account of the changes that occur through the implementation phase and which the statistics, which reflected the past, do not reflect. He did not do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the most recent figures available, on a comparison of like with like, we find that there is significant improvement on the Australian waterfront; that, unlike what the Inter-State Commission thought, the redundancy figure is much higher, the work force has been halved in real terms, and we are as efficient in turning around containers right across all of our major ports as the New Zealanders are in Auckland; and that what we have here is significant reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we want to be fair, we do not go on and then say, `Where are the blockages in the system?'. The blockage in the system at present, which is being investigated by the Industry Commission, is with the port authorities which are under State control and which are not passing on to the users the savings achieved by the rationalisation of labour on the wharf and the higher efficiency output of the container terminals. We have an Interstate Commission evaluation of that. When those findings are released, that will put me in a position of being able to deal with that problem and ensure that the users of the waterfront are able to achieve the full measure of the changes that the workers on the waterfront have brought about by agreeing to halve their work force and increase the efficiency with which they operate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is a pity that credit is not paid where it is due and that recognition is not given where efforts are made. Here is a case where real efforts have been made, and what happens to the people who have strenuously tried to achieve them? They are criticised as being defective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the next matter which Senator Parer raised, the  Hamersley Iron issue. I made it quite clear in Question Time that I do not support the Hamersley Iron strike and that I enjoin those people on strike to return to work in conformity with the direction of Commissioner Fielding of the Western Australian Industrial Relations Commission. I also said that that is the law and the law should be obeyed. And so it should. But I do not happen to believe that in this case the law is just. That is not a reason for not obeying it; it should still be obeyed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The law we have in this case is the law of the Western Australian Liberal Government in 1982, unable to be changed by the Western Australian Labor Government since 1983 because of a gerrymander in the Legislative Council in Western Australia, which means that the Government is in government but not in power in that State. Therefore, we have this survival of old Liberal legislation. The dispute in Western Australia is not a dispute under the law that we would like it to be; it is a dispute under the law that those opposite want it to be. Therefore, it reflects their notion of industrial relations. That does not diminish the obligation of people to obey it, but it does mean that those who want to change it through constitutional means should be encouraged to do that as quickly as possible, because it is a damaging dispute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that I went to Japan and talked to the Japanese about changes in Australian industrial relations. I was joined on that mission by the Chief Executive Officer of the Confederation of Australian Industry, Mr Brian Noakes, and the President of the ACTU, Mr Martin Ferguson. Here we had, speaking to the Japanese, me on behalf of the Australian Government, the chief spokesperson on behalf of Australian industry and the chief spokesperson on behalf of Australian unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Japanese were pleased to see, in the first instance, that we all came together, we were united, we had a common view and we expressed it, backed up by fact and statistic. The Japanese were also pleased to identify, despite blips and disputes that do occur, that at the core there had been a considerable change in Australian industrial relations performance. It behoves every Australian to recognise that and tell it to our trading partners to help win markets for Australia. Pretending that it is the old Fraser era level of industrial disputation helps lose markets for Australian industry; showing what the changes are under us helps win them. As a matter of national patriotism, one ought to at least tell the truth to our major trading partners. That is what the Confederation of Australian Industry did, that is what the ACTU did and that is what I did on behalf of the Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To their credit, many Japanese businessmen said, `Yes, that is true, there is a significant change'. I recall an occasion on which an old and venerated Japanese business person was referring to the disputes of the 1960s and 1970s&mdash;the disputes of the Fraser era. As he had not been back to Australia for some time, he thought that that situation still pertained. In a meeting of one of the business associations in Japan he was contradicted by younger executives working in industries with investments in Australia who said, `No, in fact, there has been a cultural shift'. If, because of these changes, we can win more markets for our products, that is a very good thing. Therefore, I say to Senator Parer: please do not decry the facts; please explain them properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the issue Senator Parer raised of independent contractors. He has neglected to recognise that last week we enacted industrial relations law here which is quite revolutionary in that it introduces an era of workplace bargaining. It is a significant decentralisation of the system, but one with protections. We do not want to decentralise,</PARA>
<PARA>throw everyone into the law of the jungle and let the devil take the hindmost. People in employment are entitled to dignity and to get a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. The system we have introduced enables that to occur. Nonetheless, it is revolutionary and will bring forth a massive change in productivity in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Parer talked about independent contractors. I will repeat some of the facts. For once in the lives of those opposite they might read the legislation and talk about what it contains, not about what they think it contains or what their prejudices or bigotries encourage them to believe it contains. This legislation reflects at a national level the industrial legislation that Premier Nick Greiner introduced into the New South Wales legislature last year. We are simply reflecting nationally New South Wales industrial law on the subject of independent contractors. The Opposition protests against us for doing this, but it is silent when it comes to the New South Wales Government, simply because it is playing politics. It is not looking at the issues; it is trying to exploit the arguments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat that we have enabled independent contractors who are victims of harsh and unreasonable contracts to have a speedy and accessible way of getting redress. Our crime is to put speedy and easy redress within the reach of independent contractors who in certain circumstances are victimised. This is taken to mean that independent contractors will be forced into trade unions. There is no such basis for that assertion, and that is well known. One merely has to read the legislation to know that that is the case. This is taken as meaning that awards can now be applied to independent contractors to set aside their contracts or that class actions can be taken. That is explicitly forbidden in the legislation, it is not true, yet the allegation keeps being made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also argued that this legislation is some way of introducing rorts onto building sites. I have had a bit of experience in the building industry in my time, as has Senator Parer. It is fair to say that rorts have been on building sites ever since Adam was in short pants. No-one likes it&mdash;I deplore it&mdash;but it is a fact of life in that industry. However, this legislation will not change that circumstance other than to allow people with contracts that are being rorted in terms which are harsh and unfair to have speedy and easy redress. It will decrease the area of rort, provide a particular area of access to justice and provide for fair judgment in those circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rest of the reform of the building industry is a much more massive task. We undertook it by announcing last year a building industry reform strategy, which is now beginning to work. The Opposition knocked the move because it perceived success for us as electoral failure for it, and it therefore had a vested interest in playing down the terms of the success. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the issues on which I am arraigned and accused are that somehow the union movement in this country is out of control, has induced the recession and is prolonging it. There is no evidence of that, and no independent economic commentator holds that view. It is a prejudice, a bigotry and one that is propounded by the Opposition because it prefers to play the man and not the ball. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is that in 1983 the accord enabled rapid employment growth to occur, wage outcomes to be moderate, living standards to rise by virtue of improvements in taxation and the social wage, and an outcome in which there was a shift in factor terms from wages to profits in this country. That structurally remains in place and is an achievement of the accord. Living standards have to remain high so that Australians can afford to consume the products that they make and produce&mdash;buy back their own goods. That has meant that we have reduced taxation and bought out wage increases by cutting taxes so that employers do not have to pay the higher wages but that workers do not suffer through the ravages of inflation. That is what the accord does, and that is a responsible economic outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am enjoined in this debate to be censured in some form because of Senator Parer's perception of the lack of waterfront reform in Australia. I have answered that charge. If the statistics were right and the comparisons were fair, the reform achieved in this country on the waterfront is consistent with that in New Zealand. That is the benchmark as far as the Opposition is concerned. Moreover, and more importantly because I have no cultural cringe to New Zealand, it is consistent with productivity outputs in major ports in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am now thirdly attacked on the basis that the performance of the union movement in this country contributes to unemployment. The union movement in this country has committed itself to achieving a wages outcome based on the inflation levels of this country, which is a moderate outcome. The year average inflation level is 1.7 per cent. That is a moderate outcome. That is possible because of an accord. In Senator Parer's version of the law of the jungle&mdash;the devil take the hindmost&mdash;there would be a wages blow-out as there was in the last year of the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I am lambasted in this place over the contractors legislation and I conclude again by shaking my head more in sorrow than in anger. If Senator Parer would only talk about what the legislation contains and not misrepresent it, he would understand that this is a social justice measure which protects independent contractors. It does not realise the dangers or fears that he talks about. Let me make this clear: the rhetoric he used and the rhetoric used by the HIA is not supported by the other major building organisation, the Master Builders Association. Yesterday I read a letter here from the Master Builders Association saying that the things the HIA were saying were not true.</PARA>

In other words, a person needs a licence to work in this country and that licence means paying $160 a year to a union.

Unions are not terrified about individuals being able to negotiate, they are not terrified about a collective arrangement between a group of employees and employers&mdash;the unions' fear is that such agreements can be entered into and can work effectively and successfully for the benefit of all without the need for unions. The reason we have the Troubleshooters legislation is that the unions were terrified that they were losing more and more power. </PARA>

While those opposite talk in bland terms about enterprise bargaining&mdash;a concept, I might add, with which we fundamentally agree; we do not have any basic arguments about the concept&mdash;they mean something quite different.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is why those opposite were such strong supporters of the APPM management in Tasmania, with its divide and rule philosophy. This is why they have supported Cliffs Robe River as strongly as they have, with its divide and rule philosophy&mdash;the dog-eat-dog approach to industrial relations, where the devil takes the hindmost.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our position is quite different. We believe in a system which upholds the dignity of the individual worker, which believes that he or she has something worthwhile to offer and which believes that the worker is worth consulting. We believe in a system which, while it has a measure of equality, does recognise differences in skills and capacities, and differences between enterprises. This is what award restructuring has been all about. It is a system in which productivity is maximised by consultation and teamwork, not by confrontation, aggression and division. It is a system which works well in continental Europe and Japan. It is a system which is in stark contrast with the conflict models, which the Opposition seems to want to follow, in the USA&mdash;particularly in the southern states of the USA&mdash;and the United Kingdom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Blind criticism of the union movement, which the Opposition is so fond of, is out of step with world opinion. Senator Cook has already drawn attention to the fact that wage restraint in this country has been noticed worldwide. It got special mention in the recent OECD report. It regarded as remarkable the level of wage restraint which had been achieved by the consensus model. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The union movement has shown more leadership than many employers&mdash;certainly more than the Opposition. If one casts one's mind back to 1983, to the first economic summit, the unions left the employers for dead and certainly left the Opposition for dead with their awareness of the sorts of problems that faced this country and the sorts of things that needed to be done about them. In a recent visit to this country, the Secretary-General of the OECD, Mr Jean-Claude Paye, noted&mdash;these were his words and he spoke them quite publicly in a number of forums&mdash;that the union movement in Australia was a visionary union movement, the like of which he had not seen anywhere in the world. He was talking in particular about its capacity to face problems, outline those problems and try to manage change in order to overcome some of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To be fair, he also praised employers for the changes that he had seen between the last time he was here in 1985 and this year when he visited us again. He said that employers had a much more outward-looking posture than they had had before. They were less cringing and inward-looking and showed a much greater capacity for export orientation and an aggressive stance in the world economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many things are still to be done. I am not pretending that the problems which face us are not difficult or that they have all been overcome, but we will get much further if we put behind us the blind prejudices about unions which are so often paraded before us by the Opposition. If we work together to try to improve things in the national interest&mdash;as many other countries and, notably, successful countries do&mdash;we will get a lot further. In the European countries and Japan, oppositions get together with governments to work in the national interest&mdash;they do not point score based on blind prejudices about unions. We would get a lot further if we worked together and attempted to be more objective in our analysis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, all the talk about productivity seems to be predicated on the idea that productivity is always about labour; that productivity is output per unit of labour input. Productivity is also about output per unit of capital input or unit of land input. There are lots of measurements of productivity but there is only one that seems to mean anything to the Opposition. I think we would get much more by consensus than we would by the confrontation which is being offered by the Opposition. </PARA>

Instead, it will put other taxes on employment; it will put training guarantee levies on employment. It will put extra demands for employer funded superannuation on employment, just to make sure that businesses cannot employ more people.

They have admitted that in many cases in years gone by. Many mistakes have been made in that area by the unions, by the employers and by governments. One remarkable thing that has happened in the last nine years&mdash;and I pay tribute to Senator Cook for his contribution to this&mdash;is the establishment of the Iron Ore Industry Consultative Council, a tripartite body consisting of the employers, the trade unions and two governments&mdash;the Federal Government and the State Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since that Iron Ore Industry Consultative Council has been in operation, industrial disputes within the Pilbara region have dropped markedly. That drop is not singularly attributed to the establishment and operation of the consultative council, but the council has played a major role in bringing it about. Not only is there the peak body which meets perhaps three times a year, but there are also local bodies which operate on a week to week, day to day basis. When problems arise, they are talked through and resolutions can be accommodated to satisfy all. It not just a question of winner takes all; it is that each side can get something out of it when there is a difference of opinion or whatever. It has worked. The statistics prove it&mdash;not only the industrial relations statistics of the strike figures, but also the productivity figures. They are there for people to examine for themselves. </PARA>

Was it Hamersley Iron in the form of Tony Finucane or any of the individual industrial relations managers? No, it was not. Was it any of the trade union people, be they shop stewards or convenors? No, it was not. Was it any member of the State or Federal governments, both of which played intimate roles in the operations of the iron ore industry in the area and the export of its product? No, it was not. It was one individual who stood himself out from the crowd; it was one individual out of in excess of 2,000 workers in the area who decided that he did not want to be part of the system. One individual has determined for himself that he is going to bring down all of the good work that has been done in the Pilbara region of Western Australia in the industrial relations field. </PARA>

It is a cost to the whole of the economy and the community of Australia. It is a cost to the employer, Hamersley Iron, which pays the wages of the individuals. The company has massive capital tied up there which is idle at the moment. It is a cost also to the workers and their families.

The Prime Minister will accept from the New South Wales Government an exemption from payroll tax on his family company's share in Danpork, but it is not good enough for the rest of Australian business. The Prime Minister accepts the exemption for his own company but he will not introduce it for other companies in Australia.

Senator Sherry should not tell me that that does not mean that Mr Keating's company can employ more people. Of course it means that Mr Keating's company can employ more people. If it is good enough for him, it should be good enough for every other company in Australia. But unfortunately that is not the situation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This debate arose out of matters relating to what is happening in the Pilbara, but it has become a debate about the philosophy of what should guide unionism or should guide people who are in the work force. I think the proposition put by the other side&mdash;that individuals have rights and that the individual should stand above the group&mdash;is accepted in many places. That argument, put by Senator Parer in his usual lucid way, can be respected. Our difficulty is that we believe individuals have rights, certainly, but we also believe that groups have rights. As we look around to see who might accept and support our philosophy, as distinct from the individualist philosophy from the other side, we see, for example, a statement from the New Zealand Catholic Bishops Conference. I know that those opposite would not accept that, and I respect their position, because their philosophy is based on matters other than those on which we base our philosophy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth reading this statement because it refers to the legislation in New Zealand of which those opposite are much enamoured. I can understand, given the basis of their philosophy, that they would be enamoured of that legislation. When Senator Sherry, I and others were in New Zealand last year, we were given a statement from the Bishops Conference. It is worth reading a passage from it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This legislative change&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the change contemplated by those opposite&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is not simply a technical issue. It involves ethics and morality.</PARA>
<PARA>That is, unfortunately, the handicap we have on this side: we act from a basis of ethics and morality. It is often a bit difficult to counter those on the other side who are less inclined to do that in this area. The statement continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The question must be asked what the new legislation does to people and society, to human dignity and the common good. As Bishops of New Zealand we must speak against this proposed legislation as its underlying ideology is contrary to the social doctrines of the Church.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the Catholic church. We do not adhere to this or that church, but we do think the sorts of things the bishops say have particular relevance in this area. The bishops quote Pope Paul VI in this way:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pope Paul VI teaches that, `All social action involves a doctrine. The Christian cannot admit that which is based upon a materialistic and atheistic philosophy'.</PARA>
<PARA>What is this materialistic and atheistic philosophy they talk about? As you know, Mr Acting Deputy President, Senator Parer is a most outstanding and decent man, but on this subject he unfortunately seems to have abandoned the sorts of things that are spoken about in this statement. What is this underlying philosophy that they talk about? The bishops go on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The underlying ideology of the new industrial legislation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is the legislation the other side would like to adopt, it seems&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is unacceptable for two reasons: firstly, because it emphasises free choice without balancing this concept with concern for the common good&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the public good&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and secondly because it emphasises the rights of the individual without their accompanying duty to act in solidarity and without giving any corresponding rights to the group.</PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly what Senator Parer is concerned about. He says, `The individual should be able to stand above the group. The individual should have no duty to act in solidarity with the others'. That is a philosophy I can understand, but I say to Senator Parer and those opposite that that philosophy is the one that is by implication described in this statement as materialistic and atheistic. </PARA>

To illustrate just how false that statement is&mdash;and I hope Senator Crane will speak after me and answer this&mdash;there is the evidence of what happened at Camperdown abattoirs. A series of people there were prosecuted for alleged violence on the picket line. All the charges have either been dismissed or withdrawn, and the police as a result have had to pay $18,000 worth of costs. The highest ranking policeman down there in the Western Districts, the superintendent, Mr Neil Patterson, according to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Warrnambool Standard</EMPHASIS> of 30 May 1992, had this to say:</PARA></TALK.START>

It appears from the cross-examination, which I will not go into as I have already referred to it on other occasions here, that a Mr Leeson was down at Camperdown to uncover evidence that could be used against the union and against the workers.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the time I have available, I wish to refer to the Hamersley Iron situation and pick up on the comments made by Senator Beahan, Senator McKiernan and the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook). This debate highlights the fundamental difference between the Opposition and the Government&mdash;ours is a position of freedom of choice; the position of the Government is one of compulsion. That has been spelt out quite clearly by what the Minister said in answer to a question today and during this debate. He said that he disagreed with the law as it exists in Western Australia. All I can say is, `Thank God for what was done in Western Australia in 1982 by the then coalition Government. Thank goodness the upper House in Western Australia has had the sense to keep that law in place since that time'. This is a debate about compulsion as against freedom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is ironic that we are having this debate today when we look at what happened in the United States last week. Mr Yeltsin, from Russia, addressed both Houses of Congress in the United States. He got a standing ovation when he said, `This is the end of the era of communism and compulsion in Russia; it is the beginning of the era of freedom and that compulsion will never return'. That is a very significant comment. Those on the other side of the chamber could well take note of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the Hamersley dispute, this debate is about one of the worst abuses of union power which can possibly exist against the rule of law. It is a matter of high principle. This debate is about the abuse of union power by a select few unions in this country, thereby destroying the good reputations of those unions who behave quite rationally and quite sensibly. If I had more time, I would go on to name some of those unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Minister commented today on the position of the legislation which was passed last week. We can compare those comments with the sorts of remarks he made last week about the Housing Industry Association&mdash;and, if we had time, it would be worth drawing a comparison also with the remarks he made about APPM in Tasmania. The Minister last week commented on the Housing Industry Association to the effect that it was extremist, disgraceful, dishonourable and disreputable, despicable, dishonest and untrue, a discredited housing organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All that the Housing Industry Association was doing was exercising its right to disagree. It did not pull out the contractors in its industry and say, `Stop building houses'. It did not say, `We are going to take the law into our own hands'. It exercised the fundamental right to disagree with the Government and to state its disagreement publicly. Yet what has this Government done in terms of broadcasting? When we go into the next election, the Government will prevent organisations like the Housing Industry Association being able to advertise those particular matters on television and elsewhere. That is the position of this Government. It wants to kill free speech; it wants to take away the right of free speech from the Housing Industry Association or any other organisation, for that matter. The union movement has a right to put its point of view to the Australian public. But the union involved at Hamersley does not have a right to hold Hamersley to ransom. It does not have the right to victimise an individual and his family&mdash;because that is what this is about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate Tony Finigan from Hamersley on his appearance on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> the other night. I hope Senator McKiernan, who is in the chamber, heard what Tony Finigan had to say on that program. Tony Finigan was asked&mdash;and this is as best as I remember it&mdash;`Wouldn't it be easy for you to sack that particular person and send him on his way and they'd all go back to work?', and he said, `Yes, it would be easy, but my company is not about breaking the law; I will not do it. That individual has a right to operate and to work on that particular site as an individual. It is his freedom of choice as to whether or not he joins the union'. It was a very brave Tony Finigan who said that, in spite of the pressure that is on the company. Employees do have that right, it has cost them dearly, and I will defend that individual's right of freedom of choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with Senator McKiernan when he said we should not be debating this matter in this place. The only reason we are debating this issue in this place is that the union up there defied the decision of the Western Australian Arbitration Commission. If it had gone back to work, we would not be debating Hamersley here in this place today. It is for that reason we are debating it. It is about time that both sides of the equation, the employers and the unions, accepted the decisions made by the Arbitration Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same position applies to that which existed in Tasmania with APPM. If the parties had accepted the first recommendations to return to work, we would not have seen the continuation of that dispute in the way we did. What we are talking about with Hamersley is whether small groups in the community have the right to abuse the law, to take the law into their own hands and to run this country by anarchy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only way to improve productivity in Australia&mdash;Senator Walters has just touched on this matter&mdash;is by putting incentive into the system; by getting rid of up-front business taxes in industry; and by giving individuals the opportunity and incentive to maximise their own efforts. That will never occur until such time as those individuals are allowed to negotiate as employee and employers together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite will not improve productivity under the certified agreement position that was put in the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill last week, particularly now that there has to be union involvement. There have to be unions on the shop floor. That was part of the legislation that was passed last week. That was a backward step in industrial relations reform by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude my remarks on this matter by re-emphasising what Senator Knowles said about the Minister misleading the Senate. The Minister has a very loose tongue when it comes to playing with the truth; he likes to stretch it out a little bit. I bring to the attention of honourable senators in this place that it was about this time in the last sitting of Parliament that we were moving to censure Senator Cook over the Robe River matter. He was forced to put documents on the table. Those documents confirmed precisely what I had been saying. He also said at that time that he was going to make an adjournment speech to resolve the matter, to clear the air. He still has not done that. He said he would do so this session, and that is recorded in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. He has only two days to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Minister is consistent: he often plays with the truth and misleads us during Question Time as to the true position and the facts. I reject the sorts of accusations he makes and the language he uses when he comes in here and talks about these matters; for example, when he talked about the Housing Industry Association and others. He has also included the NFF in his attacks in recent times. He attacks them on a false premise, on matters that are not true. That highlights very succinctly the difference between us and the Government. Our position is one of freedom and freedom of choice, the rights of the individual; the position of the Government is one of compulsion. </PARA>

<PARA>I rise to speak on the Auditor-General's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Audit</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report No. 44&mdash;Project Audit&mdash;Department of Social Security&mdash;Entitlement checks in localities with Community Development Employment Projects</EMPHASIS>, tabled in the Senate today. The community development employment projects or CDEPs which are administered by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission allow Aboriginal communities in which there are no alternative employment prospects to employ local community members to undertake community development activities. These community members are paid the equivalent of Job Search or Newstart allowance but still remain eligible for the additional family benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In December 1990, the Australian National Audit Office reported on its audit of ATSIC pertaining to CDEPs. In this audit No. 12 of 1990-91, the Auditor-General found that there was a need for ATSIC and community members to clarify their entitlements to CDEP vis-a-vis the unemployment benefit. In particular, the Auditor found a need to ensure that, in cases where the CDEP payment is less than the unemployment benefit, the person receives the difference in the unemployment benefit. In this 1990 report, the Auditor also identified a number of factors which contribute to inaccurate payments, as well as a number of areas in which there was scope for ATSIC to improve its administrative procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the August 1991 Budget, the Government foreshadowed changes to the Social Security Act to prevent recipients of Commonwealth funded employment programs, such as the CDEP, from double dipping by claiming the Job Search or Newstart allowance as well. Although it was claimed by the Department of Social Security that such instances of double dipping were rare, the necessary changes to the Social Security Act were included in the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3), which passed through Parliament late last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In June 1991, an interdepartmental review of the CDEP found that checking of the simplified CDEP participant schedules was an inadequate arrangement for DSS's crosschecking purposes. As a result, amended checking procedures were put in place during the second half of 1991 whereby there would be a greater cooperation between DSS and ATSIC in establishing new CDEP schemes, but that DSS would rely on its own liaison processes to prevent incorrect payments under social security legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, in response to proposals for enhancing the CDEP scheme placed before the Government in July 1991, it was also decided that the relevant Ministers&mdash;the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, and the Minister for Social Security&mdash;prepare for the Government's consideration a submission for coordinating client databases and facilitating the exchange of client data. This is the background against which this project audit was conducted in mid-1991. It is a background which indicates that there has been a general recognition of the need for greater accountability, better monitoring and improved liaison between ATSIC and DSS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the significant policy and procedural changes which were being implemented at the time of this audit, it is difficult to assess whether the Auditor's concerns continue to be valid today. The Government's task must be to assess the extent to which the changes in policy and procedures that he has put in place address the concerns which have been expressed by the Auditor in this report. However, it needs to be said that the ANAO has concluded in this audit report that the procedures in place at the time of review were unable to provide assurances that persons in receipt of income under CDEP schedules were not also, as individuals, incorrectly in receipt of social security benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, it is a very serious matter if people who are in receipt of CDEP payments are also receiving Job Search or Newstart allowances to which they are not entitled. Such a situation was totally contrary to the intentions of the Parliament when it amended the Social Security Act last year. It is totally contrary to the overriding rationale for the CDEP scheme whereby participants receive a CDEP wage in lieu of unemployment benefits. It also runs counter to the Auditor's earlier report in 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In light of the fact that it was found that it was not possible to be assured that persons in receipt of the CDEP were not receiving incorrect social security benefits, the Auditor made a number of recommendations which need to be taken very seriously by the Government. Most notably, the Auditor casts doubt on the validity of the policy and procedural changes announced last year whereby DSS decided to confine its responsibilities to its own programs and not to have an involvement in the delivery of the CDEP program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor contends that it is premature to endorse such a move when there remains the potential for people drawing CDEP wages to also claim DSS benefits for which they are not eligible. Instead, the Auditor believes that there is a need to pursue more coordinated and cooperative arrangements in relation to the setting up of new CDEPs, the conduct of periodic joint reviews, the coordination of databases and the conducting of a foreshadowed census of all existing CDEP communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor believes that DSS, rather than withdrawing its involvement in the CDEP scheme, is well placed to contribute to the development of the effective delivery of CDEP in remote areas because of its size, computer resources and experience. The Auditor notes that the Government, in its response to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, has recommended that there continue to be a general emphasis on `maintaining parity between CDEP wages and forgone DSS entitlements'. However, he concludes that, unless there is some form of regular check to minimise double dipping, it will be very difficult to maintain such a parity. I understand that both the Department of Social Security and ATSIC have agreed to the vast majority of the recommendations contained in this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report is also important in the light of various concepts that have been put around. In fact, Prime Minister Keating, or at least one of the Ministers on the other side, recently suggested programs for young people working on farms. A similar situation may exist in that very careful auditing needs to be done to ensure that a program such as that does not have problems associated with it and that people do not receive two benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We want every facility to be made to ensure that Aborigines in remote communities are able to carry out the programs with dignity, but we are also concerned about the Auditor's report in that the lack of coordination between some of the departments may mean that there are some problems still associated with CDEP and the possibility of double dipping from Social Security. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>This document, the forty-fifth report of 1991-92 by the Auditor-General, is a very important one, since its recommendations have implications for the future actions of many Commonwealth agencies. The report primarily addresses staffing issues and efficiencies achieved arising from the Department of Veterans' Affairs contracting out its information technology services to the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Veterans' Affairs has been somewhat of a ground breaker in the contracting out of information technology services. I understand it is the first Commonwealth agency to do so. The coalition strongly endorses the contracting out of public sector services as a general principle and, after obtaining assurances on the security of veterans' data, we supported the Government's actions with respect to the Department of Veterans' Affairs. We did that because every available taxpayers' dollar in that Department should be concentrated on the compensation and care of veterans and war widows. Any reasonable effort to contain bureaucratic overhead costs should be undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, not everybody in the Government was happy with the decision. Senator Richardson tried, and failed, to dissuade Cabinet from approving the DVA proposal. The reasons for his objection were revealed in an extraordinary four-page letter to the Prime Minister which was leaked to the press. Not surprisingly, the objections were not based on principles of financial management or any genuine concern at the implications for veterans, but rather were purely political. Senator Richardson recognised that, by supporting the outsourcing, the Government would not be in a position to exploit any community concerns over the coalition's policies. On this occasion we can be thankful that the Cabinet reached a decision based, not on the dishonest politics of the kind Senator Richardson practises, but on sound policy principles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this report, the Auditor-General has criticised a number of aspects of the outsourcing process. Inadequacies in the process were highlighted when industrial disputation occurred. The disputation was initially provoked in September last year by a lack of coordination between the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Department of Finance, resulting in Public Sector Union action. After a hearing before the IRC, disputation ceased. However, unfortunately, this was only for a short time. After a second IRC hearing, the PSU refused to comply with an order to end its disruptive activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report notes that no pensions were affected as a result of these activities. Strictly speaking, that is true, but it fails to mention that a number of health providers were very seriously affected. For instance, I received a number of representations from domiciliary nursing agencies which were faced with going out of business because they were not being paid by the Department of Veterans' Affairs for their services to veterans. This was threatening their capacity to properly care for veterans and war widows. The payment of veterans pension allowances was also disrupted, and I am surprised that that has not been noted in the Auditor-General's report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was only after long overdue ministerial intervention, and prompting from me, I might say, that the Public Sector Union accepted a staffing agreement and ended industrial action on 19 November. As a result of the inadequacies revealed in staffing negotiations, the report recommends that the Department of Finance and the Department of Industrial Relations develop a more comprehensive policy framework for dealing with the staffing aspects of outsourcing to the public sector. This is crucial, given that outsourcing activities are now being considered across a number of other agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The investigation of the staffing issues also identified shortcomings with redundancies and superannuation. I intend to draw the Auditor-General's attention to issues related to redundancies in government business enterprises which I have had some involvement with recently and which I believe the Department of Industrial Relations is not dealing with adequately. I have had assurances from the Minister, Senator Cook, that he will review the existing policy, but it is also probably something for the Auditor-General to look at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report recommends action to make sure that, for those persons where continuing employment is gained with a new supplier, access should be denied to involuntary retirement lump sum superannuation benefits. In this case alone, because of unclear legislation, the cost to the Commonwealth was $700,000. With many agencies likely to follow the same path as the Department of Veterans' Affairs, the importance of getting this provision right is obvious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also looks at the cost savings achieved as a result of the outsourcing. Net savings of $10m will be achieved over five years from February this year. The Department had claimed savings of $12.5m, but did not allow for the direct costs associated with the outsourcing, including more than half a million dollars as a result of the PSU actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While aspects of the handling of outsourcing of information technology by the Department of Veterans' Affairs have been criticised, it should be remembered, in fairness to the DVA, that it is the first department to undertake this activity. I find it extraordinary, however, that the Department of Veterans' Affairs continued to fill vacant positions in the computer centre after the decision to outsource had been made and, most incredible of all, that the promotion of one officer was actually gazetted three days after his job and the computer centre had ceased to exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report contains important recommendations for improving the handling of outsourcing in the future. I urge the Government to ensure that the suggested procedures are adopted. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Select Committee was appointed as a result of concerns raised by several Senators during debate in June 1991 on the Telecommunications Bill 1991 and associated bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concerns related specifically to absence in the legislation of any measures which would control the content of 0055 information and entertainment services provided through Telecom lines, or the content of certain videotex services formerly provided through Telecom's Discovery service, and between May 1991 and April 1992 provided as the Genesis service.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During debate on the Telecommunications Bill and associated bills, a majority of Senators formed the view that the whole issue of content and standards for telecommunications services and pay television should be the subject of an inquiry by a select committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee was tasked with finding answers to a number of questions:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the nature and content of material being transmitted over the telecommunications network;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">whether the content of that material was acceptable having regard to community standards for equivalent material available through other media;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the best way to ensure that the public interest was protected in relation to access to this material; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">whether the content of pay television should include material which would be classified in the R or X categories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee was to consider in the course of its inquiry the existing regulatory arrangements, at both State and Commonwealth levels, used to regulate all film, video, literature and other publications, and to determine whether similar arrangements were applicable to regulating the provision of commercial recorded information or entertainment services via networks utilising telecommunications technologies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee was therefore being asked to resolve the fundamental question of applying community standards, in the context of the existing classifications, to the new services of pay television, videotex and telephone message services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its May 1992 report on telephone message services, the Committee re-affirmed the recommendations it made in its December 1991 interim report, which called on Telecom Australia to adopt a code of conduct which would completely eliminate the carriage of unacceptable sexual material on the 0055 service where it was accessible by minors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry would then be allowed to cater for this market only through its 0051 closed user access service, restricted to adults who must opt in to the system using a PIN number, but only for material of an equivalence no higher than the M film/video rating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee recommended that Telecom ensure compliance with this code of conduct by utilising the expertise of the Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC) as the independent arbiter of community standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the report I am presenting today, the Committee has concluded that the evidence taken by it in relation to the availability of X-category material reflected the anomalous situation which currently exists. That is, although the sale and distribution of X-rated videos is banned in all the States, sale and distribution is legal in the Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory, and there is a mail order business for such material going to the States from the Australian Capital Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Possession of X-rated material is not an offence save in Western Australia, so that in most States such material may be legally viewed at home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Committee has given heed to the fact that the elected State governments, representing the overwhelming majority of the Australian population, have registered an objection to X-rated material by banning its sale within their jurisdictions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For this reason, and because of doubts over its suitability for pay television raised in evidence taken during the inquiry, the Committee has decided to recommend against X-rated material being permitted to be available on pay television.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has concluded in relation to R-category material that there is undoubtedly concern in the community about the level of violence and the role that depictions of violence, sexual or otherwise, may play in the formation of attitudes to violence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We recognise that the current situation is that in the Australian States and Territories R-category films and videos are available for public exhibition in cinemas, and for sale for use in private residences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite this, the Committee has decided that, in view of the inconclusive nature of the evidence received by it during its inquiry, the proposed Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA) should conduct extensive, Australia-wide quantitative and qualitative research on community standards of taste and decency in relation to classifications for pay television.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The research should also ascertain what levels of violence and depiction of sex should be allowed on pay television, and what other matters should be included for viewing by adults and children in the various classifications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until the ABA has completed this research, standards for programs on pay television should be the same as those currently set for free-to-air television by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, which would preclude R-category material being permitted to be available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to that part of the Committee's report which deals with videotex services, such as Genesis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consistent with its reports on telephone message services, which took account of the high level of public concern at the availability of `adult' information and entertainment on the telephone network, the Committee has decided to recommend that material equivalent to either the R or X film/video classification, or the Category 2 literature classification, not be available on any videotex service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has noted that Genesis Telecommunications, which provided an adult videotex service between May 1991 and April 1992, was terminated because the number of subscribers was too small to make it profitable. The Committee considers that this is an indication of the low level of community demand for and acceptance of such services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has also recommended that, as with telephone recorded message services, AOTC and other telecommunications services carriers enter into contracts with the Office of Film and Literature Classification for it to act as the monitoring and enforcement body for the code of conduct the Committee has recommended for videotex services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of its inquiry, the Committee received 2,365 submissions, many of them signed by or representing more than a single individual. In addition, 793 form letters and 61 petitions (signed by a total of 942 petitioners) were received. The Committee noted that sixty petitions relating to the subject of the Committee's inquiry had been tabled in the Senate (15,751 petitioners), and 123 in the House of Representatives (22,807) since 1989.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The second reading debate not having concluded, I would like to make a very short contribution. There has been a committee amendment circulated on behalf of the Australian Democrats in addition to those amendments already circulated by Senator Spindler. I would simply wish to raise this issue briefly in the second reading debate on the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 1992. It relates to the recent announcement by the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) of policies with regard to acceptable sexual behaviour by members of the Australian Defence Force in the one instance, and in the other instance an instruction with regard to homosexual behaviour in the Australian Defence Force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This announcement raises an issue of major concern. I believe it represents an instance where Australia is in fact failing to meet its obligations under international conventions. There is no provision under anti-discrimination legislation to cover the rights of homosexual members of our society. During the early days of the Hawke Government when anti-discrimination legislation was being passed, the Democrats said that this should have been the case. Nevertheless, it is not and it remains an area where our anti-discrimination laws are, in our view, deficient. Therefore, it is legitimate to ask why, when the Government has legislated equal opportunity for women, for migrants and will soon do so for disabled people, it has not done so for the homosexual members of our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Defence Force is an area where there is a particular problem and the community has strong views on it. The release and endorsement of those two documents, to which I referred last week, point to this problem. It is for that reason that I propose to amend the Defence Act 1903 in the committee stage of the amending <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"> I have commended, and I do so here on the public record, the defence instruction on unacceptable sexual behaviour which was tabled by the Minister for Defence in the Senate on 18 June. But I contend that, because of the broad scope of the instruction&mdash;including the welcome inclusion of sexual harassment&mdash;its clarity and appropriateness, that is all that is necessary to meet the problems which are put forward by the ADF chiefs of staff as the reasons for the separate, and I contend discriminatory, policy on homosexual behaviour in the Australian Defence Force. </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those reasons come under the headings `Command and morale', `National security', `Health' and `Minors'. The point that I make is that the general policy refers to inappropriate sexual behaviour quite differently from the specific policy with regard to homosexual behaviour, which simply talks about involvement in homosexual behaviour, such involvement being unspecified as to its appropriateness; that is, it may not necessarily be in breach of any of the general policy's prohibitions, which are quite specific. For example, point 6 of that general policy reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In all ADF and single service `on entry' training institutions, including the Australian Defence Force Academy, sexual relations and public displays of affection and private intimacy between students and staff, and between all students, regardless of their training status, are to be prohibited within the precincts of the institution and during absences from the institution on duty through the promulgation of a general order as defined by the DFDA.</PARA>
<PARA>That is an example of how specific the provisions are in the general instruction. It is the question of public display of affection and so on which I contend should apply equally to heterosexual or homosexual members of the ADF. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note the deep concern of the Human Rights Commissioner, which has been publicly expressed. I note the acknowledgment by the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate), in reply to a question from me in this place yesterday, that those discriminated against will have no recourse through the courts of this land against the policy, that our Human Rights Commissioner can report only to his Minister, and that such a report will merely be tabled in the Parliament. Senator Tate said regarding international recourse that a successful complaint under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to the United Nations Human Rights Committee will deliver only a view which cannot be enforced, and that under ILO Convention 111:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has obligations to declare and pursue a national policy designed to promote equality of opportunity and treatment with a view to eliminating any discrimination. Sexual preference is a declared ground of discrimination. In that situation, all the ILO can do is publish the representation and, where applicable, the fact of lack of a satisfactory reply by the state.</PARA>
<PARA>In this case the state is the nation of Australia. I note also concerns regarding privacy. We have had reports from individuals dismissed from the ADF who tell of fishing expeditions which make a mockery of the ADF homosexual policy directive that speaks of `the need for sympathy, understanding and discretion when dealing with the member'. But it does not provide, as the general policy on unacceptable sexual behaviour does, for dealing with false allegations. That is a major concern as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are just some of the issues which are raised by the recent announcement of the Minister for Defence. I know those issues are of concern across the community. I know they are of concern to people in this place. I believe they are concerns which must be met. That concern is widespread. In the committee stage, as I say, I will be moving an amendment which specifically prohibits discrimination on the grounds of sexual preference in making appointments to the Defence Force, in the promotion or transfer of members of the Defence Force, in respect of the period of service of any member, or in the discharge of members from the Defence Force. I believe that this must be done since it is in the defence forces that we see the last vestiges of discrimination in our society on the grounds of sexual preference.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To say the least, this is a fairly contentious issue which has now, of course, been introduced into this piece of legislation fortuitously because it was not considered a few days ago. Therefore, the vehicle is now available that otherwise would not have been.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me first of all say that the Government opposes this amendment absolutely because it is technically flawed. It would only affect the Army and not the other two Services because of the section of the Act that Senator Powell seeks to amend. That is not a criticism&mdash;I understand what happens when amendments are constructed on the run. This is a danger and I cannot criticise Senator Powell for that because on other occasions I have come back and amended a Bill that I have put through the previous session because of an inadvertent technical defect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The section that Senator Powell seeks to introduce for the defence forces is one that has been considered by Ministers for some months. I think that at the first appropriate occasion I should take the opportunity to put on the record the true processes that occurred. In Senator Powell's press release, and in those of others, the impression has been given that the chiefs of staff have ganged up on Ministers and that the Ministers have caved in. The fact is that the Chiefs of Staff Committee considered for some months this whole paper, plus&mdash;as a subsidiary of that&mdash;the view on homosexuality. The options paper it put to Minister Bilney and me contained simply options. The Committee did not come down with a conclusive view, nor did it try to force its views on the Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If, as Senator Powell says, this policy is not a good one, I have to wear the responsibility&mdash;not the Chiefs of Staff Committee in any sense. It was a decision made by me, not at the Committee's insistence and not under pressure from it. That is the way it occurred. That is true ministerial responsibility. Sometimes ministerial responsibility is either apparent or vague. On this occasion it is absolutely apparent. This is a decision made by Gordon Bilney and me. I just take the opportunity to put that on the public record. I know that there was no deliberate intent to put that in some other way. I can understand how that interpretation may have come about, but it is not true. The decision was that of the Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to that, the previous policy on the acceptability of homosexuals within the Defence Force did concentrate on the various areas read out by Senator Powell in her second reading speech. But in my statements here and elsewhere, I stressed that the key factor was in terms of the esprit de corps of the armed forces and their effectiveness. I did not go to those other issues that were there in the past in terms of security, health and other matters. They are not particularly relevant these days. I am not particularly concerned about the matter of health and the homosexual community in terms of service in the armed forces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am certainly not concerned about the security matter these days, because the world has moved a long way in the last 20 years. I had to say those two things. Whilst they were in the original policy, they were not permanent in our thinking. It was the cohesiveness and effectiveness of today's Defence Force that led Gordon Bilney, and especially me, to make that decision to leave the existing policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased that Senator Powell and others have recognised that the document produced by the Chiefs of Staff Committee on acceptable sexual behaviour, which covers areas such as harassment, et cetera, is good. I believe that it is. A lot of work and a lot of thought was put into it. The armed forces are not like every other section of the community. There are some differences. The first difference is a thing called rank. This is not a class rank, but rank exists within the armed forces. Rank implies obedience and respect. When we come to things like sexual relations, the two can get mixed up horribly and pressure can be put on, inadvertently or otherwise. The response to an overture or something else can be as much a response in respect of rank as it can be to an overture of a sexual nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are far more intense training institutions that the armed forces use. That complicates this as an issue for the moment, but not forever. The housing policies of the Defence Force which force cohabitation can also compound this issue sometimes. But if one goes around to base after base, as I am certain even my friendly opponent, Senator Newman, would concede, one starts to see single occupancy of rooms rather than multiple occupancy. That is part of the new trend in the Defence Force. Where there were previously four students or four privates, almost inevitably they are heading towards having one student, apart from during the three-month recruiting period. Those sorts of housing arrangements will change some of the relationships in the Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But some things will never change. Submarines will never change. There is a hot bunk arrangement: one person gets out and goes to work and another person dives straight into that bunk. There is not really much scope to complain about behaviour. If unacceptable behaviour occurs, the consequences on a submarine, for instance, can be absolutely horrendous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to assure honourable senators, in case they are in any doubt, that Mr Bilney and I did not retain the existing attitude towards the role of homosexuals in the armed forces out of some redneck bigotry. I hope that is accepted, but if it is not I have to wear the consequence. It certainly is not an attitude resulting from our having any phobia towards homosexuals, et cetera. We also have to say that there are homosexuals in the Australian defence forces at the moment, but we do not encourage or authorise witch-hunts against those individuals. Probably all of them perform their tasks, adequately or otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real problem is the reaction of the rest of those in the Force. That does not necessarily mean that it can be dismissed merely as redneckism or a machismo sort of behaviour. Everyone, at least until today, who signed up in the Defence Force did so under certain conditions. One of those conditions was that homosexuals were not eligible to serve; homosexual conduct, not so much preference or activity, was not allowable in the defence forces. To change the conditions absolutely, whilst those people are under return of service obligations, does not seem to me to be a useful process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is an issue outside this chamber that will be argued to both extremes, and not rationally. It is one that will generate an emotive debate and, at times, a bigoted debate. I think that is a pity, but that has to be confronted. If people think the decision that Gordon Bilney and I made was the easy way out, I ask them to think it through fairly substantially. Of course we anticipated that the ABC would be giving us a pillorying every day; of course we anticipated that the Fairfax press would come out the way it has. So it was not the easy route or the easy way out for us to adopt the retention of this particular proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I indicated in answer to a question that this issue may be challenged in the court or elsewhere. I have listened with interest to what Mr Burdekin and Senator Tate have said. I found it a little surprising that there would be so little room for appeal, because people do have appeal rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not intend to respond to Mr Burdekin; he has processes that he has to go through. He approaches his Minister with a report and, in turn, his Minister approaches me. I will not enter into a public slanging match with HREOC at this stage. What people have said, I will let them say; but I will not respond other than through the normal, formal processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, at this stage the Government will not accept Senator Powell's amendment. If I raised this matter with the 119 Labor Party Caucus members, I do not believe that everyone would agree with the decision of Gordon Bilney and me. I suppose this throws up other problems of process, which are never examined when the status quo is being endorsed. However, a new policy has to go through all those processes. A couple of my Party colleagues have indicated to me that they want to look at it as an issue&mdash;and that is their right. If they want to look at it as an issue and come back and put other arguments to me, I will not have a closed mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But at this stage I still have some fairly compelling reasons for not altering the existing policy. If we did alter the policy by acceptance of this amendment today, and if the House of Representatives were then minded to accept it, I believe we would severely affect the cohesiveness and the effectiveness of the way our defence forces are configured today. That belief comes from a lot of discussion. Honourable senators might assume that every time we go to a base we just go to the officers' mess and have a meal, and that is it. On at least half of the bases we visit we go to the other ranks' canteen. We always do a tour and stop to talk with the soldiers, the airmen and the seamen. Overwhelmingly, they would see a major problem if we were to alter the existing policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It came through very clearly to me in Kangaroo 92, as it did to every parliamentarian who visited the area during the exercise&mdash;from Pine Creek to Kununurra to Exmouth to bare base Curtin to Tindal to Darwin; no matter where we were, this was a universally raised question. Most people said, `We signed up under a certain set of conditions. How can you change those conditions?'. </PARA>

They see it as their duty to represent those under them vocally.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, Senator Powell's amendment is flawed technically&mdash;that is not a criticism&mdash;in that it would apply only to the Army. The Government is not minded to accept it in what, unfortunately, will be a confined and narrow debate, although I am not backing off the guillotine one inch. Because the amendment has been introduced so late, people have not been able to contribute to it in this chamber even in the second reading arena. I know that a number would have come in to contribute to it had it been introduced earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I assure the Committee that the decision by Minister Bilney and me is not based on any preconceived, moral judgments about individuals or preferences. If honourable senators want to go back to my record in immigration, they will find that many of my colleagues regarded me as being far too libertine in my treatment of homosexual reunion. At the time some senators on the other side made that point. We do base our sincere judgment on the premise that to move at this stage would affect the effectiveness and cohesiveness of the armed forces, and the esprit de corps that exists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do have a responsibility for pastoral care and to represent the defence forces as well as the rest of the community. We have done that, and we have done it to the best of our ability. We have come down on what has to be a fairly fine judgment to retain the existing bar. There will not be, as I have to say there has been in some stages, a grievous witch-hunt with military police spying through bedroom windows, et cetera. That is not the sort of culture that we will be involved in. If anyone in the armed forces thinks we are going to do that, that person should stand corrected immediately. On that point, the Government rejects this amendment today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am perfectly ready to attack the Government when the opportunity presents itself, but on this occasion I put on record my appreciation of the sensitive and thoughtful contribution of the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) on the Australian Democrats amendment. I think it shows an understanding of the special and unique needs of the Defence Force, which are demonstrated to be lacking by the Democrats' even having to put up this amendment. As the Minister said, this issue is regarded very differently by different groups in the community. If ever there were a need for rational debate, it is on this subject. If ever there were a need to get rid of passion in debate, it certainly is in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people call other people `homophobes'; some people are just as rude about people with another point of view. I do not have a passionate view on this issue. I have always taken the view that it is a matter which is very much central to the defence of our country and our capability to defend ourselves. Anything which will diminish our ability to effectively defend this country has to be scrutinised very carefully. As I said in my personal explanation earlier today, that is the position which I, on behalf of the Opposition, have taken since this matter first became public in February. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to look at this question totally, in the interest of the nation and our ability to defend our country. The first duty of the Government is to see that this country is properly defended. To that end, while the decision that has been taken is a ministerial one, as the Minister says, quite properly it clearly has been based on advice from the chiefs of staff. I say `properly' because this is a matter which goes to their ability to see that their troops can effectively defend the country. If we put people into such positions of authority and pre-eminence, we must be able to rely on their judgment in most things, and certainly in something as intrinsic as their ability to produce a force which can defend us. I would have been relying on the professional advice of the service chiefs, as the Minister has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also share the concern that we are talking about members of a community who work together, live in very close proximity to each other and fight in extremely close proximity to each other. There are often great difficulties with people who are frightened and need reassurance. Close friendships can and do develop in the Defence Force. There are a lot of very young people under the command of people older and more senior than them. Consideration of all these things is vital to the esprit de corps of the Force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very disappointed&mdash;and I will be more outspoken than the Minister has been&mdash;about the Human Rights Commissioner. A few nights ago on the radio I heard him most passionately arguing the case for the so-called rights of the members of the Defence Force to practise as homosexuals in the Defence Force. Mr Burdekin, of all people, should know that Defence Force personnel sign away a lot of rights when they commit themselves to the service of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are ILO conventions that this Government regards as extremely important to the protection of workers. Those rights do not transfer to the members of the Defence Force, who can be compelled to work long hours&mdash;24 hours, if necessary, or longer if there is a demand. They are told where they can work and what they will work at. They are told whether they can live out of a Defence establishment or on base. They are directed to change jobs, often quite frequently and often in places where they would never choose to live if they had their way. They are totally unable to strike. They are unable to have unions. That is so for good and proper reasons. I am not arguing that any of these things should be changed. But service men and women know when they sign on in our defence forces that by doing so they are signing away, at least while they are in uniform, many of the rights which Australians regard as basic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sexual practice of men and women within the Defence Force, whether it is heterosexual or homosexual, is proscribed and subject to military discipline. That is so for good and proper reasons. Mr Burdekin should have known that. I am very offended that a man who might be in a position of having to judge these issues has come out as part of the political debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last week or so the British also completed a review of this whole question. While it has been widely reported that they have changed their policy, in fact, all they have done is decide that they will no longer charge people for homosexual offences under military law. They have reviewed their right to administratively discharge people for homosexual practices and they have retained it. I hope that the media, which have reported this inaccurately, will get it straight and put it on the public record. </PARA>

Senator Chamarette put forward the reason that we must at all times attempt to move towards a position where this world lives in a peaceful state and where people should not be forced to do violence unto others.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a person who was conscripted in 1966&mdash;the last time there was conscription in Australia&mdash;overall I welcome the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill to make the arrangements for conscientious objection much more appropriate for the modern day. It is an amendment to the Defence Act that many of us in the mid-1960s argued for. I congratulate the Government upon finally achieving something that many of us demonstrated for in 1966. Opposition members will be pleased to know that, although I was conscripted, I failed the medical.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>I am particularly concerned about the proposal in the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill to allow selective conscientious objection. The view of the Opposition is that if one is a conscientious objector one is a conscientious objector on either religious or moral grounds which cannot be selectively applied to one conflict or another. We are talking about the defence of Australia; we are talking about apprehension of the invasion of our homeland. We do not believe that conscientious objection can be selective with somebody suffering from virtually a split personality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this country is to be invaded, surely Australian citizens have an obligation to contribute to the protection of the country. If they cannot defend their own country, they must be able to demonstrate&mdash;let us face it, conscientious objection means a long held view, a strongly held view&mdash;that it is not some fleeting whim of the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely, it will be very difficult for anybody in Australia to demonstrate that they have a conscientious objection to defending their country. It makes it even harder, I should have thought, to demonstrate that they have a conscientious objection to defending their country in either this particular instance or in another. We find it utterly illogical and totally unsatisfactory, especially as there are provisions in the legislation for true conscientious objectors to provide an alternative to military service if this country is under attack. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not believe that there is a need to provide a separate category. People who are conscientious objectors to war, and are genuinely found to be so under the procedures laid down in this Act, can provide other service to their country. People who do not have a total objection to war surely should defend this country. We do not see any rationale for the provision. In fact, we fail to understand why the Government has seen a need to put it in. It is an extraordinary provision. Perhaps the Minister can explain why the Government has done so. To date, it has not been explained satisfactorily to the Opposition why a blanket conscientious objection is not enough. How can one have a selective opposition?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This package of superannuation legislation introduces changes of fundamental significance for retirement incomes policy in Australia. It is worth recalling the genesis of the legislation. It is a direct response to the criticism by the Industrial Relations Commission of a number of aspects of award superannuation, particularly non-compliance, and the Government's refusal to accept the Commission's recommendations to convene a national conference on retirement incomes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bills require employers to make progressive increases in the minimum level of employer support over the next 10 years so that by the year 2002, 9 per cent&mdash;and probably 12 per cent of wages&mdash;will be set aside for retirement income purposes. The coalition acknowledges the need for Australians to accept increasing responsibility for their own standards of living, both during their working years&mdash;by productivity-driven enterprise bargaining&mdash;and during their retirement years. For those who cannot or do not choose to save for their retirement, a safety net by way of the age pension must remain available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is now a significant body of demographic writing which has recently been endorsed by a House of Representatives committee suggesting that, at the very least, confident predictions about the cost to government of an ageing society 30 years down the track are fraught with danger. Nonetheless, the coalition accepts that the implications of the greying of the population cannot be dismissed or down-played simply because the probable impact is unlikely to be felt until well into the next century. It makes a great deal of sense, therefore, to address the issue now, but the approach we adopt is crucial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of those who argue for compulsion do so from a narrow retirement incomes policy perspective rather than a national macro-economic approach. The key issues are affordability and capacity to pay. For countries like Singapore with growth rates of 8 per cent to 10 per cent over the past decade, it is possible to afford many elements of a comprehensive welfare state. For countries like Australia which have been going backwards in recent years, increasing levels of compulsion can only be paid for in two ways: either at the expense of jobs, if the full burden is borne by employers; or at the expense of wage increases, if workers are to bear the brunt as the Government claims they should. Either way, the outcome is very bad news for those struggling to make ends meet and for those policy-makers determined to get the country back on the track in order to provide people with rising standards of living and a greater capacity to earn and save for retirement. That is why we have undertaken to retain the floor which is in place at the time of the next election&mdash;probably 3 per cent to 4 per cent&mdash;and then to offer a range of generous tax incentives within certain contribution limits. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With Australia still suffering from the greatest economic recession it has had in 60 years and with the level of unemployment over 10 per cent, the last thing which business needs is policies which undermine the capacity of employers to expand their enterprises and increase employment. Yet the Government's proposed superannuation guarantee charge regime will add at least an extra $2 billion a year to labour costs, irrespective of the state of the international or the domestic economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even ardent advocates of compulsory superannuation, such as National Mutual, are concerned that the legislated contribution levels make no allowance for the capacity of various employers and industry to meet the requirements. The legislated approach assumes that everyone can pay higher rates at the same point in time. The impact on small business, where the great bulk of the burden will undoubtedly fall, is particularly severe. The Victorian Automobile Chamber of Commerce estimates that for an average award employee, total on-costs will rise from 31.5 per cent to 37 per cent of labour costs and even more for many staff not covered by awards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like the training guarantee levy, the SGL is a de facto payroll or employment tax imposed regardless of profitability, but, unlike the TGL, it offers no prospect of productivity improvements. Since the SGC is being imposed as a legislative obligation, there will not be any opportunity for employers to bargain any offsetting productivity increases with their work force. At a time of very weak demand, firms will have great difficulty in absorbing the costs or passing them on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There can be little doubt that most Australians aspire to a higher level of retirement income than that enjoyed by the current generation. After eight years in office, the present Federal Government has finally managed to achieve an age pension equivalent to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. But the capacity to make significant future improvements will be critically affected by the health of the national economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Already more than three-quarters of persons of age pension age receive at least a part pension at a cost to revenue of approximately $12 billion a year. This amount will undoubtedly increase with the ageing of the population unless there are a number of significant structural changes, such as the gradual raising of the age pension age for women, the abolition of compulsory retirement ages and the easing of pensioner poverty traps. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line is that a country simply cannot achieve permanent increases in national savings and retirement incomes unless they are financed by faster economic growth, higher levels of productivity and rising levels of disposable income. These are not simply retirement incomes issues&mdash;they are national economic issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two major arguments constantly advanced by the Government to justify a compulsory system are the need to boost national savings and the need to curb the rising cost of age pensions. There is undoubtedly an urgent need to boost national savings. Household savings have more than halved from a peak of about 15 per cent of disposable income in the mid 1970s to just over 6 per cent in 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it by no means follows that forcing workers to go without wage increases will help the cause. As overseas experience has shown, unless there is rising output and productivity increases, compulsory savings in one form will simply lead to a run-down in savings elsewhere. Treasury is particularly conscious of this switching effect. The most that it claims in favour of the SGL is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Higher superannuation savings would not be fully offset by reductions in other savings because many employees have equivalent levels of non-superannuation savings and superannuation savings are not a perfect substitute for other savings. . . .  Some substitution . . . can be expected, however, . . . there is unlikely to be complete substitution. No estimate of the likely magnitude of this effect is available.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, there is likely to be a very significant switching effect&mdash;not a perfect switch by any means, but a very high level of switching. Therefore, it cannot be said with any degree of confidence that there will be any particular level of increase in savings as a result of this regime. As Paddy McGuinness has cogently argued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The weight of economic evidence is that imposing compulsory superannuation on individuals does not increase total savings. It simply causes people to save less of their residual income, their take home pay.</PARA>
<PARA>Or worse still, to go further into debt. Professor John Freebairn is right when he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The key to providing high income in retirement is the pursuit of policies promoting high economic growth.</PARA>
<PARA>Even prominent advocates of government intervention, such as Ray Block, who gave evidence to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation on behalf CEDA, admitted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we realise that the increase in national savings will only be marginal.</PARA>
<PARA>According to Peter Griffin, Managing Director of Rothschilds, a compulsory system is unlikely to increase national savings and will lead to lower returns to savers, as well as a big distortion in the allocation of investment capital and the workings of the capital market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key to national savings is to build a sound economy and provide incentives to save. A leading retirement incomes commentator, Daryl Dixon, told the Senate Committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the key to increasing national savings is to give people incentive to save.</PARA>
<PARA>Professor Julian Disney, a member of EPAC, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . if one is concerned about national savings, it seems to me self-evident that the best way of encouraging savings is to provide a savings incentive for the widest range of purposes.</PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, the critical issue is national savings&mdash;that is, how much the country as a whole saves&mdash;not the savings of any particular group. The OECD's most resent comparison of savings patterns shows that Australia's national savings averaged 20 per cent of national income throughout the 1980s down from around 24 per cent in the 1960s and 1970s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there is no evidence that the Government's superannuation initiatives have produced or will produce a large increase in national savings. Indeed, it is possible that the Government's initiatives are exacerbating a major shift in savings away from traditional retail financial institutions. This structural shift of savings will have profound and largely unforeseen consequences for the composition of investment flows. Compulsory superannuation would hasten the process by allowing major taxation concessions for compulsory superannuation. National savings may actually decline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are no short cuts to economic prosperity, nor is there any magic retirement incomes pudding, whereby increasing levels of retirement income can be forced on employees or encouraged by taxpayers, irrespective of capacity to pay. This is recognised by all the major institutions. National Mutual Life has urged the Government to deregulate the labour market, deregulate and privatise key areas of the economy, including transportation, communications and government business enterprises, and to direct the fiscal stimulus toward encouraging savings in long term private sector investment. The coalition supports, and indeed has made the running on, many of these vital national reforms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the nation experiencing a protracted economic crisis of Argentinean dimensions, more than ever it is vital to take a leaf out of the Japanese postwar rebuilding book and start to engender a national savings culture. This will not come about via a system of compulsory superannuation which pretends to put all the burden on employers. Inevitably, many employees will take the view that their superannuation needs are being taken care of by others and that there is no need for them to make any further provision for their retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This lowest common denominator approach is quite the opposite of a savings culture. Indeed, once compulsory superannuation is firmly entrenched, it will not be long before politicians are being urged to take the view that tax concessions&mdash;currently around $3.5 billion and set to at least double by the turn of the century&mdash;could be better used elsewhere. Indeed, there are a number of senior Government figures who already take this view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the most damning indictment of the SGC proposals is their impact on employment. It is quite fatuous, and indeed disingenuous, to pretend&mdash;as the Government's principal spokesman on superannuation, Senator McMullan, did recently&mdash;that the levy will not be an additional cost. In the initial stages at least most employers would already pay out the required amount of superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation does not tinker around the edges. It will involve substantial cost increases to provide superannuation cover for possibly 800,000 non-managerial, non-award private sector wage and salary earners, possibly 50,000 to 100,000 public sector employees currently lacking effective coverage, for example, due to poor vesting, and possibly 650,000 employees of non-complying employers, at least 600,000 of whom are in the private sector. These new recruits constitute 25 to 30 per cent of private sector employment and around 5 per cent in the public sector. Overwhelmingly, they are in small businesses. Some are young professionals who consciously prefer not to save via superannuation until much closer to retirement, but the great bulk are employees earning less than average weekly earnings. The fact is that many firms are not even paying the first 3 per cent of award superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cook, the Minister for Industrial Relations, has estimated that the outstanding amount is around $700m a year. The main reason, according to his own Department, is that most employers simply cannot afford to do so. As Treasury made clear in its evidence to the Committee, if the full unit cost impact is to be borne by employers, there will be up to 45,000 jobs lost over the next two years and up to 100,000 jobs lost over the next five years. The only way to avoid such an outcome is to discount wage increases for the effect of the SGC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this the Government steadfastly refuses to do. Instead, it piously promises that if Australia's inflation rate gets significantly out of line with those of our major trading partners, it will somehow depart from a specified legislated timetable for annual increases in contributions to the year 2002. In this regard, the following extract from the Committee's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> is most instructive:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Alston: Your submission states: `The effect on employers net savings will be influenced by the extent to which increases in employer superannuation contributions are taken into account in wage negotiations. If increases in contributions do not result in any change in employee's total remuneration&mdash;which you say elsewhere must include superannuation&mdash;employer's net savings positions should not change significantly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In other words, the SGC will be at the expense of wage increases. That is what it is saying, is it not?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Preston: It is saying that wage increases will be lower than they would otherwise have been.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Alston: And if it does not involve any net increase in the cost burden to employers, it must be at the expense of wage increases, must it not?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Preston: Yes.</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Preston is the Deputy Secretary to the Commonwealth Treasury. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's refusal to give firm and specific commitments to discount wage increases contains the seed of an economic and social disaster waiting to happen. If Australia is to become truly competitive as quickly as possible, it must surely do everything at this stage to lower its export cost structure. Once the fruits of increased exports start to flow through, there will be a sound case for employees being entitled to share in the increased profits. But, to ignore actual costs and wait perhaps several years at least before making some subjective comparative judgments about international inflation rates will only ensure that our economic predicament will worsen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent weeks the Government has claimed that the economy will be able to afford both the increased cost of the SGC and a wage claim well in excess of inflation, because of claimed unprecedented growth rates and productivity increases. These utterly unlikely and intuitively implausible predictions have been greeted with a great deal of scepticism on all sides and the recent downward revision of the expected 1992-93 growth rate from 4.75 per cent to 4 per cent by the Government's own economic adviser, the Joint Economic Forecasters Group, is simply official confirmation that these targets are absurdly optimistic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian business is in no position to afford a multibillion dollar payroll tax, especially one which is scheduled in most cases to treble or even quadruple within eight years. Even if existing double dipping loopholes are closed, it would be of little consolation to taxpayers if a declining pension bill is more than offset by the rising costs of the national dole cheque. More importantly, however, the dangers to the social fabric of high and prolonged unemployment are already apparent worldwide. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With unemployment levels on present policy certain to stay around 10 per cent for years to come, and even the Government claiming only a marginal improvement over the next few years, it would be little short of lunacy to introduce a massive new cost burden on employers&mdash;with unions saying only that the cost will be taken into account in further wage negotiations. History over the last decade offers no basis for any confidence that any reliance at all could be placed on such a vague and essentially meaningless formula.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who pays? Unlike every other compulsory system in the world, the SGC legislation puts the burden entirely on employers, many of whom will be expected to find 12 per cent within 10 years. The Government's timetable ostensibly requires employers to pay 9 per cent by the year 2002, but it is clear that they will be expected to pay the last 3 per cent as well. The Government has said only that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it will give consideration to using employee contributions and tax cuts.</PARA>
<PARA>This `employer pays' approach will inevitably encourage many employees to take the view that superannuation is no longer their responsibility, thereby ensuring a lowest common denominator outcome for retirement incomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to other wage and salary earners. If the Government persists in its pretence that the cost of the SGC will be funded by general reductions in wage increases, this clearly means that those already in receipt of the prescribed level of superannuation will be required to go without a wage rise to cross-subsidise those without superannuation coverage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some real losers: part time and casual employees. Those who will do worst out of compulsory superannuation are part time and casual employees, more than two million of whom are women. Not only will they be effectively forced to forgo substantial wage rises, but also the amount set aside for them in the name of superannuation will be decimated by administration, insurance and taxation charges, leaving them with a small cash pittance and no retirement income. The retail industry, which is the largest employer of staff in the private sector, and is traditionally a major employer of part time and casual employees, has made it clear that the legislation will not only be administratively complex but also will lead to immediate job reductions, particularly in the depths of the current recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Retailers Council of Australia is also concerned that to allow the levy to operate in conjunction with the existing award system will expose employers to a situation of double jeopardy, particularly because of the vast differences in award superannuation provisions compared with the standard levy requirement. This is particularly evident with the different qualifying periods, which vary between States but in most instances require a person to be employed for at least six months before payments are made, usually retrospectively. This contrasts with the SGC legislation, which will require payment for all part time and casual employees from day one, even though major retailers such as Woolworths have a staff turnover of 30 per cent a year. According to Coles-Myer, the country's largest private employer, with 135,000 employees, of whom 32 per cent are regular casuals under the age of 21:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not only would there be a significant administration burden for both the company and funds if such employees are to receive employer funded occupational superannuation, but there would be no real gain for the individual in terms of retirement income.</PARA>
<PARA>As the SGC applies only to those in the paid work force, some two million non-working women are denied access to the alleged benefits, despite the fact that not only do they live longer than men but also they are particularly financially vulnerable in their retirement years in the event of early widowhood or divorce. The Fightback proposals explicitly address this and, unconstrained by industrial relations considerations and ACTU veto, we will certainly ensure that those who are in most need of superannuation access will have it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the time the Bills were introduced into Parliament on 2 April 1992, the Government has been insisting on a 1 July 1992 start-up date. This is despite the fact that there has been no clamour for such a date from any organisation except the ACTU. On the contrary, a wide range of community groups and organisations have repeatedly requested the Government to at least defer the legislation and convene a national conference to be attended by all interested parties in order to develop a long term, viable and effective retirement incomes policy for Australia. The coalition would welcome such an initiative and would be keen to play an active and constructive role in any such discussions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not one witness before the Committee seriously sought to justify the indecent haste of a 1 July start-up date. According to Brian Scullin, even ASFA, which generally supports the thrust of the legislation, told the Committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there remains in our view a number of significant defects in the legislation and ten of these are in the paper that I have tabled today. . . As none of these have yet been addressed by the Government and businesses throughout the country are complaining about the impossibility of meeting such a tight deadline the Government has no option but to defer the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>It is plain, therefore, that the only explanation for the Government's obsession is its anxiety to have its accord deal with the ACTU in place well before the next election. Such a justification is almost a perversion of the democratic process. When the country is crying out for a sensible long term approach to retirement incomes policy, the Government seems determined to honour a back room deal irrespective of the consequences and in defiance of overwhelming community opposition. The irony is that once the workers of Australia become aware that they are, at least in theory, expected to forgo wage rises and accept lower standards of living in order to disqualify themselves from the age pension, they will be most unlikely to show any gratitude to this Government at the ballot box. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One cannot help but agree with the Business Council, which urged the Government prior to the last Budget to postpone its plans to legislate for superannuation until agreement is reached by employers, unions and the Government as to the future direction of superannuation and retirement incomes policy. It has consistently stressed the need for a: . . . comprehensive approach to retirement incomes based on outcomes rather than contributions.</PARA>
<PARA>The small business sector will be particularly affected by the legislation as the bulk of non-compliance is in this area and most of this comes about through inability rather than unwillingness to pay, compounded by genuine uncertainties about the appropriate fund. One of the best summaries of all the objections to the current legislation was enunciated by Mr Willis on behalf of the MTIA. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, that the timing of 1 July 1992 will impose an unsustainable cost burden on industry, unavoidably resulting in further business closures and job losses. Given the protracted and the severe recession being experienced and the urgent need to lift business investment to improve both competitiveness and employment opportunities, this new employment tax is totally unjustified; second, that the arbitrary timetable for future contribution increases may also be prejudicial to future economic growth later in the 1990s; third, that the form of the Bill is unnecessarily complex and costly to administer; fourth, that another tier of legal compliance for superannuation will compound the problem of excessive regulations rather than contributing to necessary simplification; fifth, that the many uncertainties of the proposal, including the extent to which consequential cost increases are to be offset against future wage claims, may cause significant industrial disputation; sixth, that there is no firm provision for direct employee contributions and seventh, that the exemption and thresholds are unrealistically low and will result in a substantial number of costly but ineffectual benefits.</PARA>
<PARA>As far as consultation is concerned, again the evidence to the Committee speaks for itself. Mr Emery, the Under Treasurer of the South Australian Treasury, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . our Premier wrote on behalf of all Premiers requesting Treasury and other consultation before the legislation was introduced and that request was simply declined.</PARA>
<PARA>Ms Jane Elix, Director of the Federation of Consumer Organisations, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has undertaken no consultation with the community at large and absolutely minimal consultation with the organised community sector.</PARA>
<PARA>Ms Eva Cox of the Womens' Economic Think Tank said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this is a deal between the Government and the ACTU about something which has got very little to do with retirement income and much more to do with the politics of the union movement and the Government.</PARA>
<PARA>The Bills will pose substantial administrative difficulties for employers, many of whom are likely to find that they have unintentionally failed to comply with its strict requirements and have thereby incurred an SGL shortfall. In many instances, a significant increase in contributions will be involved simply by virtue of updating current award contributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, many awards currently specify a fixed contribution of 3 per cent of the appropriate wage when the award was granted&mdash;which may be as long ago as 1986. Thus even 3 per cent of the current wage would effectively require an additional 2 to 3 per cent payment. Many industrial awards require superannuation contributions to be paid into particular funds. As a result, many employers face considerable administrative difficulties and increased expenses by being required to pay into a multiplicity of industry funds nominated by separate awards which do not allow employers and employees to develop their own superannuation arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The levy regime perpetuates the continuing lack of freedom for employees to choose their preferred superannuation fund. This is graphically illustrated in Queensland where the retail award allows for employee choice and, as a result, an overwhelming number of staff choose to use the company fund instead of REST, the industry fund. The coalition's Fightback proposals address this obvious unfairness and will provide those employees with the flexibility that they ought to be entitled to but which this legislation denies them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst it purports to allow contributions to be made to `any complying fund', it will not excuse failure to comply with award obligations. Indeed, Treasurer Dawkins has made it clear that the Government will support ACTU attempts to vary award provisions so as to absorb the increases in compulsory employer contributions. As Treasury recently admitted to the Senate Committee, once a compulsory system is in place there is no economic or financial justification for the retention of an award-based system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The SGL legislation does not require any levels of contribution for self-employed persons&mdash;yet another anomaly. If it is so important to insist that the employed work force should be required to accept a compulsory regime, there is no good reason why the self-employed should be exempt, particularly as some of the Government's most generous concessions are directed towards them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole thrust of the legislation is to force private sector employers to fully fund ever increasing amounts of superannuation. It therefore makes no sense at all that public sector schemes with current accumulated liabilities of between $80 to $100 billion are to be excused from the discipline of funded arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The SGL goes to the heart of the debate about superannuation in this country. It is an accord solution to an industrial relations problem. It does nothing to address the fundamental complexities and inequities of the present system, but merely seeks to force an unaffordable timetable on top of the current unfair and inefficient award based system. Insistence on industrial relations solutions to retirement income problems has led to award superannuation which, after six years of massive non-compliance, has failed so badly that the Government now finds it necessary to resort to a compulsory system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But superannuation arrangements remain fatally flawed in a number of respects. In almost every instance this is because the ACTU has vetoed sensible changes which have long been advocated by serious commentators and superannuation industry analysts&mdash;for example: closing off double dipping; raising the preservation age; restricting access to lump sum payments; gradually aligning the age pension age for men and women; encouraging employees to contribute to the cost of funding their own retirement; allowing part time and casual employees to have access to low cost superannuation arrangements outside the award system; abolishing compulsory retirement ages; providing deferred pensions; and allowing women outside the paid work force to contribute to superannuation schemes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's Fightback package has bitten all of these bullets but, because of ACTU and government intransigence, instead of a rational retirement incomes policy Australia is now to be saddled with the worst of all worlds: an industrial relations based early retirement scheme totally unrelated to capacity to pay and funded entirely by employers via a multi-billion dollar payroll tax, which is likely to cost many thousands of jobs and run the very real risk of reigniting inflation over the next decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those concerned to alleviate Australia's current savings problem and future age pension cost problems, these Bills are not the way to go. The answers to our economic problems do not lie in compulsion or conscription, but rather in a concerted, voluntary national effort whereby all Australians will reap the rewards of their own honest endeavours both during their working lives and in their retirement. As in many areas of human endeavour, it is no substitute to leave it all to the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The four pieces of legislation the Senate is considering tonight&mdash;the Superannuation Legislation (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 1992, the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Bill 1992, the Superannuation Guarantee Charge Bill 1992 and the Superannuation Guarantee (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1992&mdash;represent one of the most fundamental and important reforms to social security in the nine years of this Labor Government. It ranks alongside the reforms and introduction of Medicare as the most important social security change of this Government and certainly ranks amongst the most important social security changes ever made by a Commonwealth Government in the last 90 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Up until the last 10 years, retirement incomes have primarily been based on a pension, which now currently stands at some 26 per cent of average weekly earnings, or on what is known as private sector superannuation. Up until 1983, private sector superannuation was largely the preserve of those who were highly paid&mdash;a minority of the work force who enjoyed very substantial and lucrative tax concessions which were varied by this Government in 1986. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I intend to deal with the following areas of policy relating to these pieces of legislation: first, why should we act now; second, the economic impact of the legislation; third, the likely retirement benefits; fourth, the impact on Budget figures; fifth, the employment and inflation implications of the legislation; sixth, the interaction of the legislation and social security benefits, that is, the existing pension; seventh, the attitude of State governments; eighth, some other arguments against this legislation; and, finally, the alternative vision that those opposite are offering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These pieces of legislation are very long term in their effect. They will not come into full effect for 30 to 40 years. In that sense, they are unique because it is very rare for politicians in this country to look beyond the next election, let alone beyond the next 10 elections. It is to the credit of this Government and, indeed, particularly to the credit of the present Prime Minister, Paul Keating, who, while he was Treasurer, first enacted the major changes in pension superannuation retirement incomes in this country. For the last 80 years this issue has been debated time and time again, yet precious little reform had occurred until the present Prime Minister took the initiative with some long term policy and some long term vision about the future of retirement incomes in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why should we act now? We face an ageing population. While it is true that the dependency ratio will not change a great deal over the next 20 years, it is true that there is a marked shift in the dependency ratio from persons under the age of 14 to persons over the age of 65. It costs two and a half times the economic resources to support someone over the age of 65 as compared with someone under the age of 14. What is more, even though the number of young persons is declining, it is extremely difficult to shift resources away from young persons&mdash;the education sector&mdash;towards the elderly. If we are to prosper and to advance as a nation, we need to increase our resources on young persons in the area of education. It is not simply a matter of shifting resources away. We need to increase our resources on both our young and our elderly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of an ageing population, we currently have some 11 per cent of the population over the age of 65. By the year 2030 that will have doubled to just over 21 per cent. As for superannuation overseas, it was very clear from the evidence that was presented to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, of which I was Chair, that overwhelmingly the overseas experience has been to adopt levels of compulsion that are in fact generally much higher than is being proposed in this legislation. If we look down the list of 24 overseas countries that were surveyed by the Senate Committee on Superannuation, all but two of them provide for very significant levels of compulsory retirement contribution benefits. Indeed, the employer contributions average in all of those countries is some 13.7 per cent; employee contributions average 9.95 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New Zealand, like Australia, has not provided for its elderly and has not put aside significant levels of money&mdash;in fact, none at all. In New Zealand last year the new National Party Government, faced with severe budgetary restrictions, attempted to reduce the old age pension. There is a lesson in that for this country if we do not attempt to save adequate levels of retirement income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our report investigated and received hundreds of submissions on the issue of the levels of contributions required. Without almost any contradictory submissions, overwhelmingly it was put to our Committee that levels of contributions in the order of 12 per cent to 15 per cent are required. The Institute of Actuaries of Australia, the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, AMP, Mercer, Campbell, Cook and Knight, the ACTU, even the business organisations, whilst they might disagree with the timing and with who pays, submitted overwhelmingly that we should be contributing levels of 12 to 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the issue of compulsion versus voluntarism, again from the evidence that was gathered before the Committee in the last year, not just at the hearings that were held on this legislation, the overwhelming evidence was for compulsion. Indeed, at the present time we have a tax system that pays for a pension system. That is based on compulsion. People will simply not&mdash;the overseas experience shows this&mdash;voluntarily save adequate levels of income for their pension retirement. That is the theory that is being advanced by those opposite. If that is the theory, why were more Australians not saving for their superannuation prior to 1983 when we had one of the lowest tax regimes and the most favourable tax treatment&mdash;less than 5 per cent? Why were they not saving then? The simple answer is that voluntarism does not work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other important theme behind this legislation is the compliance levels with the current superannuation provisions. The Department of Industrial Relations submitted evidence to the Committee&mdash;and it was the only reliable survey that was carried out&mdash;which showed that some 14 per cent of the work force in this country are currently missing out on their legal entitlements, their 3 per cent. There were a variety of reasons advanced for that. That is a very important principle. There are many employers&mdash;not all of them but many&mdash;who are simply ignoring their legal obligations. One of the important elements of this legislation is to ensure that the legal obligations are being met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next issue I wish to consider is the economic impact of this legislation. The Treasury estimated that there would be a 2 per cent increase in our national savings in the next 15 years, and that by the year 2020 there would be a 2.5 per cent increase. Similarly, independent economists Fitzgerald and Harper submitted that there would be a 3 per cent increase in national savings in the Australian economy over the next 10 years. They submitted that Treasury estimates were initially very conservative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Alston advanced an argument about Singapore, which has a compulsory contribution level of 40 per cent. He said that we cannot afford to do what Singapore has done or go anywhere near what Singapore has done. Yet Singapore started 30 years ago, back in the 1950s. Its level of investment, its employment levels and its economy were basically underdeveloped. I would submit that the 40 per cent contribution level is in fact one of the dynamic factors behind the growth of the Singapore economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the retirement benefits that will come out of the superannuation guarantee levy, the Treasury put forward the projection that, after 40 years and with real levels of return at 4 per cent, which is a fairly conservative estimate, a person on half average weekly earnings, about $16,000 a year, would receive a pension that is 31 per cent greater than the current old age pension; a person on three-quarters of average weekly earnings would receive a pension some 17 per cent greater than the current old age pension; and a person on average weekly earnings, currently just over $30,000 a year, would receive a pension 17 per cent greater than the current old age pension. A person on 1 1/2 times average weekly earnings would also receive an improvement on his or her old age pension. Those figures are not contested. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Initially, there will be a net cost to the Budget because of these reforms in terms of the tax deductions if the current tax regime remains in place. By the year 1999, there will be a net loss to the Budget of $1,100m. By the year 2009, some 20 years hence, there will be a net loss of $887m. By the year 2019 there will be a net gain to the Budget of $33m&mdash;in current dollar terms&mdash;and by the year 2029 there will be a net gain to the Budget of $1,100m. In 40 years time, when we are all dead and gone, or have certainly all left this place, the proposals that we are passing tonight will save very significant levels of expenditure in the Budgets. As I said earlier, it is extremely rare for any government to look that far forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the employment and inflation impact, much has been said about these issues, and much of it, frankly, has been nonsense.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is estimated that the total cost of these proposals to the economy will be 3 to 4 per cent over the next decade. Again that figure has not been refuted. It is 3 to 4 per cent&mdash;not 9 per cent, as some people seem to believe and claim. At the present time, we already have a floor of 3 per cent for the overwhelming majority of people. In many cases, those luckier persons in the work force enjoy levels much greater than 3, 4 or even 5 per cent. So, with the phase-in of this proposal to 9 per cent over the next decade, those persons who enjoy significantly better than 3 per cent will be absorbed within that 9 per cent until we get to the 9 per cent levels. That is why the cost is 3 to 4 per cent, spread across the total economy. That figure has not been refuted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the first year of this proposal&mdash;this was before the recent changes that the Government accepted&mdash;Treasury estimated that the likely cost would be between 1.5 and 2 per cent on inflation. That is going to be a high figure, given the recent changes that were announced. It will have an inflationary impact of no greater than about 1.5 to 1.7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much nonsense has been spoken about employment. These increases of 3 to 4 per cent over the next decade, which is a very responsible timetable, will be offset against future wage productivity increases. The Opposition claims that if they are not offset there will be a massive increase in unemployment. That is true. If they were not offset there would be an increase in unemployment. But the ACTU has committed itself&mdash;and the Government has gone one step further and said that it will legislate in the Industrial Relations Act&mdash;to ensure that the 3 to 4 per cent cost impact will be taken into account. So there will be no increase in unemployment as a result of this legislation; there will be none at all. This is a good time to be introducing this legislation. It is a time of low inflation; it is a time when the economic indicators show that we are coming out of a recession, when the productivity growth in the economy will be at its most significant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In evidence presented to our Committee on this issue, it was submitted that real unit labour costs have increased in the last two years due to the recession, but they will fall with recovery and increased capacity utilisation. That is happening at the present time. Industry has been restructuring. It has spare capacity so that during this recovery there will be an increase in productivity, unit costs will fall and profits will rise. That is what is happening in the economy at the current time. Most of the overseas countries that we surveyed were taking a far-sighted view. They were introducing this type of measure in the 1930s and the 1940s when the economic conditions in those countries were far worse than they are in Australia today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the truth of the matter for those that argue against this proposal is that no time is a good time. It does not matter how good the times are, business will never face up to a responsibility to have to pay. But it is not simply a matter of business paying or employees paying out of future wage increases; if we want a decent level of pensions, the community as a whole has to pay the cost of an adequate level of pensions and retirement income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of this proposal, pensions can be maintained and strengthened. I referred earlier to the tragic situation that New Zealand faces; it is an area with public policy prescriptions that those opposite like to cite and want to adopt in all sorts of government policy areas. The truth of the matter is that, if we do not adopt this policy, if we do not start reducing the impact of pension costs on our budget over the next 20 to 30 years, it will be impossible to maintain the current old age pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next issue I would like to turn to is the role of State governments in this debate. They, like business, have been strongly opposing the proposals before us tonight in a most reprehensible way. The cost of this increase will be taken into account in terms of public sector wage rises. So it will not have the financial impact that State governments claim. But State governments have gone two steps further, and most perversely, in their arguments. Current State government schemes are grossly inequitable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We carried out a survey of State public sector funds. Only four States responded. I do not know what happened to the others. If this issue is so important, one would have thought they would have bothered to respond to surveys on the matter. In South Australia, only 30 per cent of public sector employees are in the very generous public sector fund, which in effect has contribution levels of 15 per cent, while 70 per cent of public sector employees are in the 3 per cent fund. There are two classes of public sector employees in South Australia. The 30 per cent are very well off with notional contribution levels&mdash;because these levels are not funded&mdash;of 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Western Australia, the figure is worse. In that State, 30 per cent of public sector workers are in the public sector fund, 60 per cent in the 3 per cent fund, and the remaining 10 per cent of public sector employees in no fund at all. In Queensland&mdash;I pay some tribute to Queensland as it is the only fully funded public sector fund in the country&mdash;one half is in the public sector fund and the other half is in the 3 per cent fund. In New South Wales, 72 per cent of public sector employees are in the much more generous public sector fund while only 28 per cent are in the 3 per cent fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the sort of inequity that the superannuation guarantee charge is designed to cure. I find it appalling that we should have some Labor State governments arguing against this proposal. The State governments have been involved in one other appalling display of behaviour over the past few years. They have been quite busily converting from pensions to lump sums and indirectly have been encouraging the practice of double dipping. They have been encouraging public servants to take lump sum payments, to spend them in part, and then to convert them to a part pension, which is a cost to Commonwealth revenue. We have an appalling approach by State governments to this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the other arguments that have been advanced against this legislation include an allegation&mdash;which is false&mdash;that the Government has not been addressing some big picture items. There were a range of submissions put before the Committee in the past year from a number of organisations, including ACOSS, the Womens Electoral Lobby, and the Federation of Consumer Organisations, about other issues such as prudential and safety matters; reform of the iniquitous tax concessions on superannuation; the preservation age; and the allegedly high administration costs, which, frankly, I think is a side issue. Those sorts of issues also need to be taken care of. It is certainly right that they do need to be taken care of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government has adopted in record time&mdash;12 days&mdash;many of the recommendations on prudential issues made by the Senate Select Committee. The Government will hand down its tax reform package on superannuation in the next month. It will deal with the preservation issue. As I have indicated, I do not accept that administration costs were a real issue, but if they were a real issue the reforms that have been indicated in the amendment will take care of any problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us deal with this administration costs issue. It is being used by the Opposition very frequently in the debate. If we look at the old cut-off point of $250 a month, a 3 per cent contribution would give a total of $90 a year, which does not take out administration costs. If that is increased to 12 per cent by the year 2002, as is proposed, that level of contribution rises to $360 a year. Given the Government's amendment, if it is $450 a month, a yearly contribution of $162 at 3 per cent would rise to $648 in the year 2002. We surveyed the administration charges made by most of the major funds. They averaged between 60c and $1 a week. The argument that the administration costs eat away at the contributions is not a real argument; it is a false argument. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government is moving towards reforming the big picture items. Superannuation is a complex issue. It has been ignored for 80 years by all other governments. No-one could seriously expect to bring in one piece of legislation to totally reform every aspect of superannuation overnight. What this Government has done in the past eight or nine years, and what it will be doing over the next year, is transform and put into place a total superannuation picture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The arguments advanced by some of the consumer organisations and the women's organisations that persons should get a pay rise instead of superannuation do have some superficial attraction, but for persons to receive a pay rise in lieu of superannuation is not a real option and it never has been. The constitutional power to carry that out does not exist, nor do the political opportunities, except in indirect ways, with the Federal Government providing some direct targeting of persons on lesser incomes through the social security system or through some form of flat wage increase. All the big picture issues are being faced up to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the alternative vision that the Opposition is proposing? Senator Alston, on behalf of the Opposition, refuses to believe there is a problem. There is a fundamental difference between us and those opposite. Senator Alston prefers to believe that there is not a great problem facing us. When we tabled our report on Thursday, 18 June, Senator Alston said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The pace of technological change is ever-accelerating. Who knows? It could be anything from euthanasia to dramatic reforms in bio-technology.</PARA>
<PARA>That is Senator Alston's proposed vision. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am saying that there will be so many technological changes in bio-technology that we may well find that the cost of maintaining the elderly is actually a great deal cheaper than it is today. We talked about how the abolition of compulsory retirement ages would also ease the burden quite dramatically.</PARA>
<PARA>That is some sort of vision that Senator Alston, on behalf of the Opposition, offers this country! He is basically saying, `Let's ignore the problem. Let's not do what every other major OECD country has done'&mdash;except New Zealand; and we know what has happened in New Zealand&mdash;`Let's simply ignore the problem. But if we do have a problem, we can rely on some theoretical biotechnological changes. If that doesn't work, we can rely on euthanasia'. It is a fascinating prospect that the Opposition offers for the elderly in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other part of the vision the Opposition offers is freedom of choice. We regularly hear this notion of freedom of choice from those opposite. They are proposing that employers and employees should be able to direct their moneys into whatever fund takes their fancy. What is the reality of the outcome if that occurs? The moneys will be directed away from the larger industry and employer funds that currently exist, which have enormous economies of scale, and, as I indicated earlier in this debate, administration charges of between 60c and $1 a week. Superannuation investment will be in the hands of agents, who in many cases have been charging iniquitous and enormous fees and commissions. That is what the Opposition wants to do. It perversely, under the argument of freedom of choice, wants to allow agents' fees and commissions to eat into the superannuation levels. We will not have a bar of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the Opposition's philosophical approach, it is presenting voluntarism to us: people will go away and voluntarily save 10 to 12 per cent of their income and, whoopee, they will have an old age pension. That is what the Opposition is arguing for. We know it will not work. I prophesy that if those opposite unfortunately win the next election, they will change their policy after the election and they will not reverse what we are putting in place. Every major country except New Zealand has relied on compulsion and levels of at least 12 to 15 per cent. Voluntarism does not work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the reality of the Opposition's policy? The reality of the Opposition's policy is that in 30 to 40 years time, based on contribution levels of 5 per cent, it will effectively halve people's pensions. That is the Opposition's policy going into the next election&mdash;to halve pension payments. That will be the outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we are talking about truth and honesty, let us look at the seven taxes that the Opposition says it will abolish in its Fightback package. I refer to the so-called abolition of the superannuation tax.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. We are also in a period when the average age of the population is increasing for all sorts of obvious reasons. That means that by about the year 2020 we will experience dramatic increases in the proportion of the population which is receiving social security. The so-called dependency ratio&mdash;that is, the ratio of social security recipients to the working population&mdash;will also increase dramatically. If we just ignore the problem, if we continue to ignore the marked failure of Australians to save for what I believe is a combination of political and cultural reasons, if we continue to ignore the failure of 90 years of voluntarism, which is what the Opposition is proposing&mdash;it is saying, `Let's wait another 10 years and we'll see whether voluntarism really works because we've got some magic solution'&mdash;and wait another 10 years, we are facing a disastrous choice. Even if we take the optimistic projections of the recent report by Barry Jones's House of Representatives Standing Committee on Long Term Strategies, we will be facing an increase in costs of approximately 2 1/2 per cent of GDP to support our retired population. I say to Senator Panizza that the cost will be nearly doubled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not sound like much money to some people until we put it into current values. In current values, this represents an extra $10 billion in taxation that we have to find. That is $10 billion, or perhaps an increase in personal income tax of 20 per cent for every single taxpayer. Or we could opt for the much less fair option of the abolition of the wholesale sales tax and the introduction of the GST, without any compensation or income tax reductions. This extra revenue would simply be needed to maintain&mdash;not to increase&mdash;what I consider to be an inadequate pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the electoral unpalatability for most governments, of whatever persuasion, of increasing taxation at all&mdash;even to create employment during a recession&mdash;it is ridiculous and naive to assert that future administrations and, indeed, the working population of Australia will agree to such a dramatic increase in taxation simply to maintain the present level of age pension. Put bluntly, the opportunism of the political system will ensure that such changes do not happen. We all understand why. It means that the living standards of retirees without superannuation or other savings will fall. We will go back to the days when we saw those graphic pictures of pensioners being forced to eat dog food. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the context within which this legislation must be considered. That is the way the Australian Democrats have approached this problem. I wish to put on record the fact that this package of legislation is not our preferred option; we have always preferred a truly national, portable superannuation model. This would involve the centralisation of administration and the formal integration of the pension system and the superannuation system. In effect, people would purchase an additional pension on top of the basic age pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We think that this would have a large number of benefits over the privatised model we are debating. We think it would totally and permanently simplify the superannuation system. Employers and employees would have to deal with only one administration agency. The proportion of members' funds spent on administration costs&mdash;something Senator Panizza has suddenly discovered is of concern&mdash;fees and commissions would be dramatically lower than the $500m which is currently expended. We think this would free up much needed capital for use in more productive areas and would increase the returns derived by members. We see this as a classic win-win situation, but the reality is that nobody agrees with us. The question of solvency of such a fund would not arise and the massive reserves necessary under the Life Insurance Act would not be necessary as a government guarantee would operate. This is the kind of system which most OECD countries have adopted, and which is highly supported in these countries. Instead, the Democrats have to choose between a government system based on compulsion and an Opposition system based on voluntarism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very interesting to look at the history of attempts to impose national superannuation on this country. It is a sorry history and one that is not very well understood. I refer all honourable senators, especially Opposition senators, to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Income Support for the Retired and the Aged: An Agenda for Reform</EMPHASIS>. During the 1890s&mdash;100 years ago&mdash;both the New South Wales and Victorian governments extensively investigated compulsory superannuation after Bismarck, of all people, introduced his revolutionary scheme in Germany in 1889. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Kemp can see, compulsion is not something dreamed up by this Government; governments of Senator Kemp's persuasion have flirted and attempted to impose it as well. In 1905 the Commonwealth established a royal commission into old age pensions which rejected the German model and, instead, recommended the current age pension. However, just a few years later, many again started thinking of a national superannuation system. At least one of the reasons was that the German system was widely believed to have contributed to improved industrial efficiency of the German economy, a point which Senator Kemp seems to have missed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the beginning of the First World War 14 nations, including the major European countries, had a national superannuation system. Between 1913 and 1939 three unsuccessful attempts were made to introduce a compulsory system of contributory national superannuation in Australia. These were all by non-Labor parties and they all failed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, the failure of the 1938 legislation has some strange parallels with last year's leadership struggle. The pretender at the time, Mr Menzies, was a supporter of the 1938 legislation, which was passed by the Parliament but was never commenced because of the opposition of the financial establishments of the time. Eventually, Mr Menzies replaced Mr Lyons and then promptly forgot about his commitment to national superannuation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am here to remind Mr Keating. Mr Keating used the superannuation proposal before us today as a key element in his ascension to the prime ministership but, unlike Mr Menzies, his Government is at least pressing ahead with the measure. In 1943 the national welfare fund was established by the Curtin Government. This was to be the basis of a comprehensive system of welfare, something along the lines of the present excellent system which operates in Singapore. As a separate tax, the social services contribution was introduced in 1945 to fund the benefits to be paid from the national welfare fund. This tax was absorbed into general income tax in 1950, and from 1952 the national welfare fund was funded purely from Consolidated Revenue until it was abolished in 1985. Then the Whitlam Administration commissioned the Hancock National Superannuation Committee of Inquiry, which delivered an excellent report which was shelved and then rejected by the Fraser Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have had this issue on the agenda for a hundred years and it has been put in the too-hard basket every time. We have come to the situation tonight where we are going to make a decision. We have heard the predictable assertions from the competing vested interests&mdash;business saying it cannot afford the rise in these current economic conditions, particularly the 3 per cent to 5 per cent rise; the ACTU saying that workers are owed this industrial gain as part of an adequate retirement incomes policy and as part of a wages trade-off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats, by virtue of their balance of power, have had to assess the proposals and weigh up what we believe to be in the best interests of 90 per cent of the employees of this nation. It was the Democrats who moved to have the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation established. The Committee has examined the legislation in detail. It has sought the views of a very diverse cross-section of the community, including foremost experts in the fields of superannuation, industrial relations and retirement incomes. In coming to our position of support for this legislation, we have exhaustively covered every option and every possible variation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overwhelmingly&mdash;and this has always been our starting point&mdash;the evidence to the Committee has supported a compulsory levy. We have the overseas evidence where every major comparable country has a compulsory system of some sort. We have the evidence of the various accounting bodies; the evidence of actuaries; the expert evidence of Professor David Knox, who was advising the Opposition in the superannuation area; and the evidence of the study by Harper and Fitzgerald, which shows that a voluntary system will not deliver the claimed benefits, especially given the taxation proposals in the Fightback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, we have a trade union movement which has accepted, and which will be legally bound to accept as a result of amendments, that this superannuation charge will be taken into account when negotiating future wage increases. We believe that is a major bonus to the affordability of this scheme. To those on this side who continue to claim that we should be fearful of these unions who are going to go around and push for an extra one per cent because `the Democrats did not give them five; they only gave them four', I say, `Let them push all they like; let the Industrial Relations Commission make the decision, as it should rightly do'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To continue to assert, as some members of the Opposition do, that the Industrial Relations Commission will be blackmailed and will not do what in fact it has to do, is to accuse the Industrial Relations Commission of deliberately breaking the law.

We have seen what I regard as disgraceful but predictable misrepresentations from the Opposition and from other groups on this question. It all revolves around this 100,000 job loss worst case scenario. Dr Alan Preston of the Treasury was asked questions by Senator Alston on the possible effects of the legislation on employment. These questions were based on the totally ridiculous assumption&mdash;referred to by the Secretary to the Treasury as garbage&mdash;that the whole of the levy would be a net cost to business, that there would be no offset against wage rises. This is a completely invalid assumption and Senator Alston knows that.

We have seen that happen with the fringe benefits tax and the capital gains tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us take a moment to look at the big changes in superannuation policy which the Opposition has made in recent years. A couple of years ago, the Opposition rhetoric was to totally oppose what it called `union dominated superannuation'. In fact, what union dominated meant was equal&mdash;not sole&mdash;trustee representation for employee representatives and for employer representatives. That big lie was promoted for years until last year's Wollongong conference. During his speech at that conference, Senator Alston reiterated his Party's continued opposition to union dominated superannuation. His comments were so badly received by the industry that he has never repeated them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A few months ago the first report of the Select Committee was released. Recommendation 5.1 of that excellent report was agreed to by us all, including Senator Alston and Senator Watson. Just to refresh our memories, I will quote it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the requirement for equal employer/employee representation should apply to all funds with arms' length members; that is, funds with 5 or more members.</PARA>
<PARA>Just over one year ago, Senator Alston and the coalition went from a position of opposing any employee representation for funds with 200 or more members to creating support for the principle of democracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second major back flip in superannuation policy by the Opposition has been in the taxation arrangements which currently apply to contributions. On 12 December 1990, Senator Alston opposed Government amendments to introduce the partial rebate system which currently applies where employees earn less than $31,000. The Democrat spokesperson at the time made the point that a system of rebates was much fairer in a progressive taxation system than the prevailing system based on tax deductions. At the time, Senator Alston stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What appalled me more than anything was that he seems to have swallowed the Government line on this whole change and simply picked up, at its most base level, the notion that somehow rebates are better than tax deductions and that that, therefore leads inexorably to equity in the field.</PARA>
<PARA>So 18 months ago the Opposition was appalled by the notion that rebates were proposed as a more equitable way to provide tax incentives. Guess what! The Fightback package adopted completely the concept of flat rate rebates for employee contributions and the taxation of contributions at the marginal rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to put this in context because Opposition senators are sitting here tonight trying to pretend to us that their policy today has always been fixed in concrete and that they know exactly the reasons why voluntarism is the preferred method. They are telling us that they have a lot of confidence when I am pointing to their history of back flips on major issues relating to superannuation. I am predicting that we will see more in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate the Opposition on its late but sensible change of direction. I remind the Senate of the recent plea of Mr Ian Salmon that the Government and the Opposition adopt some common proposals in this area. The Democrats have extracted from the Government an agreement to increase the threshold of the levy from $500,000 to $1m. We believe that this will protect the jobs of 250,000 employees. In addition, the initial rate of the levy will be 4 per cent, with a disallowable increase to 5 per cent from 1 January. This increase will be assessed at the time with reference to the strength and scope of the recovery. As such, we believe that we have absolutely minimised the immediate impact of the levy on employment. In addition, we have slowed down the implementation by two further years. Any such criticisms on the basis of the impact of the levy are completely bogus and are seen to be so by most people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The critics also ignore the fact that we have convinced the Government to amend the Industrial Relations Act to enshrine the fact that the Commission must take into account the effect of the levy in national wage case decisions. This is a superior outcome to the original proposal. We are glad to have had the opportunity to change and improve the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the benefits of the proposals for two specific groups in the community. The first of these is women. There has been much comment on how the superannuation guarantee charge will affect women. I guess that we have to ask which group of women. I say in passing that it is extraordinary that none of the big players has addressed the issue of superannuation for all women.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am reading from a letter. Finally, I wish to address the equity concerns which have been raised in respect of the legislation. I believe that most of the equity shortcomings can be addressed. Firstly, the welfare lobby correctly stated that for very low income earners&mdash;those earning below the income tax threshold&mdash;a rise in wages would be preferable to compulsory superannuation. I agree with that position. We are supporting the Government's amendment to raise the threshold from $250 per month to $400 per month, because it goes some way towards achieving that outcome. Even when the levy is operating at 9 per cent, the lowest amount payable would be $5.60 per week. Even if there were no charges on this rate of contribution, it would never grow into a significant amount of retirement income. Evidence provided by Coles-Myer also outlined the position facing part time students and casual workers, who make up a high proportion of its work force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We think the benefits of raising the threshold outweigh the drawbacks. However, the point has to be made that State or Federal industrial tribunals can at any time grant award-based arrangements which start at a lower level. Indeed, there are some such arrangements currently operating. As I have stated in this chamber before, the Democrats support a pay rise for this category. We think the most effective way for this to occur is for the upcoming national wage case to consist of a flat rate award. This gives the greatest benefit to the very low paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We think that administration charges should be limited to 5 per cent of the contributions of members, and I recommended this outcome in my minority report.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, I will be moving an amendment which will allow flat rate superannuation arrangements to be paid by employers instead of the current strict employee-based system.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real question of equity is that of taxation concessions which apply to superannuation. This legislation does not deal with taxation at all. This issue will come up in the next session, and the Democrats and the Opposition have the numbers to fix those inequities. Certainly, the Opposition's policy on this aspect of superannuation is a good starting point, but I understand that there are some technical problems which have to be overcome with that proposal.

I know we need training for people to get jobs, and if, as I said this morning, we can identify the jobs and determine what training is relevant for those vacancies, we might think about it a bit differently. But there is no other conclusion that anyone can come to as a result of the legislation which was passed this morning and that which will be passed this evening&mdash;because the Democrats are agreeing to the Government's guillotine&mdash;that these are taxes on jobs and jobs will be lost. It is all very well for the Democrats to say that it will not be 100,000 jobs. I hope it is not 100,000 jobs, but there is very good reason to think that it will be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the short period remaining in which to debate the Superannuation Legislation (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 1992, the  Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Bill 1992, the Superannuation Guarantee Charge Bill 1992 and the Superannuation Guarantee (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1992, having been given only four hours in total and the Government and the Democrats having taken an hour of that time already, I wish to refer to that group of people in the community which is totally ignored by the Government and by the Democrats; that is, women. This is occupational based superannuation. It has no bearing at all on those in the community who have part time jobs or casual jobs, 75 per cent of whom are women. It makes no provision whatever for the two million women who are outside the paid work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the Labor Party is still living in the antiquated times when the appropriate way for a woman to regard her superannuation was to think that she could rely upon her husband's superannuation. Once upon a time that may have been adequate; it no longer is, for several reasons, one of which is that one out of three marriages ends in divorce.  No woman now can rely on her husband's superannuation to provide for her retirement income. Retirement income is of vital importance, particularly to women, as the population is ageing. Women outlive men and the facts do not need to be reiterated tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the quaint situation with the Commonwealth superannuation scheme that a widow of a Commonwealth superannuant receives only a portion of his pension. What genius worked out that that was appropriate for her to maintain a standard of living of the same order as previously is quite beyond me. Her mortgage repayments do not drop because her husband is no longer there, her rates do not drop because her husband is no longer there, but she has to try to make do for all those expenses with the lower amount that she then receives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It certainly was not me who first said that superannuation has been designed by men for men, but it is certainly a statement that we cannot help but think of tonight in discussing this legislation and the Labor Party's attitude of perpetuating superannuation as a male prerogative. It has not been designed to help women or take into account their needs or employment patterns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One out of four women only are in employment with an employer-sponsored superannuation scheme. One out of two men are in such a scheme. In the industries and occupations where most women work there are no superannuation schemes. There are still few women in management, and I hope that will change dramatically in the next few years. Senator Sherry has spent some time tonight telling us about the imagination of this scheme and that we are looking at a 30- to 40-year project&mdash;and so we should&mdash;in relation to retirement income. But surely we can take the women of this country with us into such a scheme if it is going to be as imaginative as he says. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He says it is a great social security change&mdash;why he used that expression I do not know&mdash;and compared it with Medicare. That will send the fear of you know who into most people, especially those who have been sick and those who have been attempting to rely on Medicare. But most women are employed in part time and casual employment. They are excluded from most superannuation schemes which exist presently and will still be excluded after this legislation is passed tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation, the explanatory memorandum and the second reading speech take no account of the work patterns of either men or women. If one does not fit into the usual mould, one does not fit in and that is that. In most superannuation schemes it takes 10 to 15 years before people are entitled to their employer benefit. That does not fit the work pattern of many women in our community. It is totally inappropriate for women. I invite those opposite and the Democrats to read the report of the Lavarch Committee on equal opportunity and equal status for women, in which a great deal of work has been done in many areas, including this one. It recognises that women are not covered, but the Government has still not responded to the needs of women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Sherry's speech got 10 out of 10 for passion, but he missed out on dealing with a lot of the issues which are of vital importance. I was interested to hear him talk about the way in which the beneficiaries of Labor's superannuation scheme would receive amounts significantly above the value of average weekly earnings. This is the second half-hour speech we have heard from Senator Sherry in five days on the matter of superannuation. He is, of course, the Chairman of the Select Committee on Superannuation, and he spoke when the Committee presented its report last Thursday. I will quote from that speech because it is interesting and it substantiates the point I am making tonight that women just do not fit into the Labor Party's mould when it comes to superannuation. He referred to the fact that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is proposing by the year 2002 a 12 per cent level of contributions.</PARA>
<PARA>That represents 40 per cent of average weekly earnings. So all of these males whom the Labor Party and the Democrats are busily looking after will, if the scheme continues in this fashion, by the year 2002 be able to obtain superannuation to the value of 40 per cent of average weekly earnings. But what about all of the women to whom I referred who will not be able to be in that scheme, who are not in the work force or who are part time or casual? Senator Sherry did not forget them. Let me tell honourable senators what he had to say about women. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With regard to those persons who do not spend significant time in the work force&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and I stress the words `significant time'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that includes, particularly, women who, for significant periods, are in many case bearing children&mdash;it is important to emphasise that the current old age pension will be maintained.</PARA>
<PARA>I suppose we are expected to bow three times and be ever grateful to the Labor Party and the Democrats that the current rate of old age pension will be maintained, giving those on it&mdash;particularly women, according to Senator Sherry&mdash;an income of 26 per cent of average weekly earnings. In the same breath, he tells us that those people whom the Government has put into a super scheme will get 40 per cent. That is the attitude of the Labor Party and the Democrats with regard to women and that is the point that I wanted to make tonight without going into the whole of the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to refer to our attitude to women in the Fightback policy. I shall not go into the whole details of it, but it is an aspect which is specifically referred to as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a major initiative to assist women in particular, the Coalition will allow spouses, either in a married or defacto relationship, to make tax rebatable contributions in respect of themselves and their partner. Such contributions will be immediately vested and preserved in the name of the beneficiary.</PARA>
<PARA>That is very different from what we are looking at tonight. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The maximum rebatable amount will be $1,500 a year in respect of a maximum contribution of $6,000 a year. This rebate, raised by the spouse in whose name the contributions are made will be in addition to $1,500 rebate available to all individuals in respect of their own superannuation arrangements. The maximum rebatable contribution that can be made by a married/defacto couple will be $12,000 per annum.</PARA>
<PARA>It then goes on to refer to part time and casual employees and to the opportunity for those who are not or who are intermittently in the work force to have a retirement savings account. We specifically recognise the need for a retirement income of a decent standard for women as they get older, as there are less people in the work force&mdash;which has been referred to tonight&mdash;and things of that nature. We are prepared to do something about women's retirement income and their future. The Labor Party and the Democrats are not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Sherry referred to this being a 30- to 40-year project. Why then is it necessary to bring this levy in on 1 July 1992 when we are still in the depths of recession and when even the Labor Party is only just beginning to tentatively refer to the fact that we may be turning the corner?  Surely, if this proposal were the right way to go for superannuation, it would be better to wait a short time&mdash;which is what the Labor Party would have us believe is the case&mdash;until business is thriving a little better than it is at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One will not find much joy towards superannuation and retirement income from any person who loses his or her job as a result of the two taxes placed on business today. But jobs will be lost because businesses will not be able to absorb the training guarantee levy and the superannuation increase which descend upon them next week on 1 July 1992. However, tonight I am particularly concerned about the women of this country as they get older. I am also concerned that the Labor Party and the Democrats are prepared to proceed with the male-dominated superannuation that we have had for as long as superannuation has existed in this country. Not the slightest attempt has been made to give decent retirement income proposals to women so that they can look forward to a retirement with better than 26 per cent of average weekly earnings, which is the best that the Labor Party is prepared to offer them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are discussing the Superannuation Legislation (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 1992, the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Bill 1992, the Superannuation Guarantee Charge Bill 1992 and the Superannuation Guarantee (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1992. Occupational superannuation in the form of a Federal award entitlement dates from a decision in 1986 in the national wage case to include a superannuation component in Federal awards. That component, of course, was 3 per cent. In the 1990-91 national wage case, the ACTU argued for a further 3 per cent round of award contributions, and the Government supported the ACTU's claims noting:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Occupational superannuation is a key element in the Government's retirement income policy of encouraging retirement provision by employees during their working lives to achieve adequate living standards . . . and the key to providing better income for the growing number of old people in the future is to increase savings now. Improved access to superannuation is the best way of achieving this.</PARA>
<PARA>The Industry Commission then proposed that a national conference should take place and the Government, faced with that, decided to legislate. The Senate has heard Senator Alston tonight talk about the Business Council's opposition. I am reminded of the employers who opposed award superannuation in 1986. It is as well to remember their opposition. They opposed award superannuation in 1986, just as the Opposition opposes it today and, of course, as many employer organisations still do. I quote from the transcript of the 1986 award case when the CAI, the leading employers organisation, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whatever the reasons for the government's inaction, it may be clear to us that the question of retirement incomes and in particular the structure of the superannuation system is one which squarely lies within the legislative responsibility of the government.</PARA>
<PARA>It went on further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Having taken those steps, it is within its power to go further and legislate for the superannuation structure that it wishes to see operate within the community and, in our strong submission, it is the parliament which is the appropriate forum to determine the question of national superannuation coverage and it is for the parliament to make those decisions and not this commission.</PARA>
<PARA>So that is what the CAI, the leading employers organisation in this country, said when in 1986 it faced award superannuation. Of course, this Government is making that decision in the legislation before us tonight. Still, the major employer organisations oppose this proposal and the coalition, as usual, supports it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The superannuation guarantee Bills introduce compulsion in a system that, as far as I am concerned, has failed ordinary wage and salary earners until this point. The employer often gave only to the elite in any particular workplace. It is the higher paid minority which historically has received superannuation in this country. The chiefs always got it; the Indians always missed out. That is my experience over a long period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a former life, I was a trade union secretary and I can see the people to this day who missed out because of the voluntary system that we had, particularly under countless Liberal regimes in previous years. Because the schemes were usually based on an enterprise or a group of companies, the employer always had the key on the employee. When employees had accumulated a certain amount of superannuation, they found that their salary did not move quickly enough because they were locked into that employer. If they wanted to either move their employment to gain a promotion or to improve their salary position, they found that they had a conflict because, as soon as they moved to leave, the employer deducted so much from the superannuation that had been accrued that there was a financial loss for the employee. In other words, the message was clear: `Move from that particular employer's establishment and you will be punished'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the system of voluntarism that we have had in this country. That is the system that has torn people apart and made them sick with worry because in their individual cases they had to make this terrible decision. Often, even when they left the employment, if they finally took the decision to leave, they were filled with resentment and anger because they had not received a fair return for the years they had invested with that particular company. Of course, in those days the employer invariably dominated the trustees of the company fund, so the employee usually did not even have a voice at the trustee level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have seen voluntarism work in real life, not as some theoretical, dry formula. I have seen the people punished by that system. That is why I strongly support the Government's legislation&mdash;because it sets out to redress the voluntary system that existed in which there were endless tax incentives. If it were to work with money being thrown at it, it would have worked. But it did not work. So many people were punished by it that it deserves to be relegated to the scrap heap of history. It is no wonder that the Australian Council of Trade Unions supports the SGL proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to compulsion, the ACTU noted that award superannuation has meant that 79 per cent of the work force is covered by superannuation, including 72 per cent of all women workers. I want to take up what Senator Reid was saying about women. Women will not be excluded, particularly as there has been a great increase in the number of women participating in the work force. When we project that into the next 20 or 30 years, we face for the first time&mdash;not what Senator Reid has been saying about women being neglected&mdash;women being able to be treated absolutely equally. As those figures that I mentioned earlier of the percentages of women who are now covered by superannuation in the work force indicate, and as the ACTU concluded before the Superannuation Committee, for women and the lower paid workers, compulsion has worked and delivered benefits where a system based on incentives has failed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, there is failure in every level of the existing system. I have a short example of a particular attempt to gain redress under the award system. Without going into the confidential details, I will give some idea of the sorts of problems people have in chasing up an entitlement. This was a breach. A letter was sent on 28 August 1990; a follow-up letter was sent on 24 September; 10 phone calls were made; three letters were sent to the employer; two letters were received from the employer; there were 12 phone calls with the employers association; there were 16 phone calls with the superannuation fund; and then finally there was the need to prosecute. That is very typical of some of the weaknesses that we have had&mdash;even though there has been improvement&mdash;where we do not have the power of the law enforcing superannuation rights for people in this country. So that is why I certainly support compulsion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that there is a need to create economic security. It is part of the process of empowering people to have that security for their retirement. Economic security is the first thing that citizens in a modern state demand from government. They are getting that in this legislation today. This package extends the economic security of older Australians into the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was strengthened in my resolve&mdash;I do not usually quote Treasury&mdash;when Mr Cole, the Secretary to the Treasury, came before the Superannuation Committee. He talked about the need for this legislation and said:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . .     . . .     . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, the present low average levels of superannuation support in the work force, particularly in the private sector, hold out little promise of significant improvements for future retirees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . .     . . .     . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thirdly, the long period that it typically takes to accrue retirement benefits necessarily means a correspondingly greater urgency for action now.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . .     . . .     . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fourthly, the demographic structure of the Australian population is going to age markedly . . . and delays in increasing the present inadequate levels of superannuation support will exacerbate the difficulties in meeting the retirement income needs of an ageing population.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, . . . it is also my judgment&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is Mr Cole's judgment&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that the pace of adjustment towards the SGL's interim target is calibrated pretty well, having regard to the current economic position and prospective developments.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Cole added:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the SGL will be of greatest benefit to those principally low paid workers who currently have no superannuation support, or whose only superannuation is provided under an industrial award . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He further said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the impact of the SGL on retirement incomes is very progressive, with the greatest proportion of increases going to low income earners with the lowest levels of existing superannuation support, and absolutely nothing going to those who are already adequately covered by existing superannuation arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA>We have a major proposal. It is a compromise to some extent, but it is achieving agreement on a long term strategy. I think the Government can be very proud of that. Senator Sherry has pointed out that the financial drain will continue until the year 2019. Senator Kernot pointed out that if we do not act now the real crisis will occur in 2020. </PARA>

In the early 1950s, as a teenager, I went to a meeting of an organisation that supported the Chifley Government's national welfare fund.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. Between 1945 and before its defeat on 10 December 1949, the Chifley Government introduced this fund which was the basis for the future superannuation scheme, and probably a couple of other schemes. In the early 1950s Sir Arthur Fadden from the Country Party, the Treasurer of the day, clouted that money and put it into Consolidated Revenue. Although the fund continued until 1985, effectively the coalition Government put the resources that had been built up for a superannuation fund into Consolidated Revenue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind honourable senators that we moved from a situation in the early 1950s when the Menzies Government and subsequent conservative leaders at election time said `Five bob for the pensioners' to the introduction of indexation when the Labor Government came to power. It is not good enough. We have to change the past practices of coalition governments by allowing this legislation.

From what I said earlier, I believe the jury is still out on the superannuation industry. I hope that by the time the Committee has finalised its three reports and the Government has reacted to them we will have cleaned up the superannuation industry and made it sufficiently answerable to the needs of the Australian people, bearing in mind that this legislation will impose great pressure on the industry to clean up its act and gain the probity and the trust that the Australian people require from it. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Superannuation Legislation (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill, the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Bill, the Superannuation Guarantee Charge Bill and the Superannuation Guarantee (Consequential Amendments) Bill ask this Senate and the people of Australia to accept a basket of proposals of great complexity that most of the country cannot possibly understand. The Government does not understand it and I am sure the Australian Democrats do not understand it, in spite of the attention it has been given in the media. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This proposal does not define the benefit that might accrue to individuals at the end of the day. It results in tax gains for the Government, it strengthens the ACTU and it provides an enormous bundle of new and continuing business to life offices. This package will not result in significant increases in savings, as claimed by the Government. Even the Democrats, in their minority report published in the second report of the Select Committee on Superannuation, acknowledged that. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's position is that this legislation simply attempts to create a much larger pool of retirement savings. The fundamental design of the retirement incomes framework is a separate and distinct issue which must be dealt with in isolation.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Government is saying, `Pass this legislation and trust us to deal with other outstanding issues'. The Democrats said that they did not agree with that kind of approach.

I have said that I believe there should be a better retirement income than what is around at present. The major arguments put forward by the Government to justify a compulsory system are the need to boost national savings and the need to curb the rising cost of age pensions. The reality is that this country cannot achieve permanent increases in national savings and retirement incomes unless they are financed by a faster growing economic situation. Unfortunately, we are in exactly the opposite situation at present. The result will be a high number of job losses, which no-one on the Government side of the chamber or on the Democrats benches wants to hear about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are not simply retirement issues; they are national economic issues. The Government simply does not know how to address that issue.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The growth of the Budget deficit from the time the One Nation statement was released to the recent Premiers Conference illustrates exactly what I have said.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Compulsory superannuation will only result in a limited, if any, increase in national savings. I will come to that later. The most likely change will be a drift from savings in banks to superannuation funds. That is all. The figures that were quoted earlier this evening about the increase in national savings, even in the next 20 or 30 years, were very minimal. Even I, sceptical about what would happen, thought that they would be greater than that. It will result in a large increase in unemployment, as has been pointed out this evening.

The sharing system&mdash;whether it is half and half or some other arrangement&mdash;is in place in Germany, Japan, Singapore and Italy, to mention just a few. The Government and the Democrats will undoubtedly say that the employees will be sharing the cost of the superannuation levy by obtaining smaller wage increases than might otherwise be the case. I could believe that, but can honourable senators opposite tell me that when these employees at the end of the week, the end of the month or the end of three months see their diminishing purchasing power at the supermarket they will not go for a wage rise? If they go for a wage rise when they have less and less disposable income they will be granted further increases. They have to be. They will get them.

The answer is that we in the Opposition do not know, the Government does not know and the Democrats do not know. But we have a fair idea of what will happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The time available to me in this debate is limited, so I will address just a few particular problems. As I said earlier, superannuation funds are efficient. I will use as an example one that I pay into for one of my employees. Of the 3 per cent contribution that my company made on his behalf last year, 11.62 per cent went towards insurance costs&mdash;I presume that means life cover&mdash;16.06 per cent went towards administration fees, and 10.84 per cent went towards contribution tax. A total of 38.52 per cent of the contribution went to other than increasing his savings. Taken as a percentage of his already built up savings in the fund, insurance costs are 3.03 per cent; administration fees, 4.2 per cent; and contribution tax, 2.84 per cent. That means that 10.07 per cent of his total benefits in the fund are being slowly drained away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also looked at the conditions whereby an employee could collect his superannuation. Death cover starts at $16,000 and moves up. I looked at the conditions for a casual employee or someone who may decide to take 12 months off work and travel overseas. If an employee has not worked and has not contributed for six months and is killed he has no death cover. Even though insurance and death cover have been taken out of his contributions every year, he is not covered. </PARA>

Can Senator West tell me whether any of hers are any different. I believe that superannuation schemes should be contributed to equally by employer and employee. What is wrong with an employee doing some saving? Can anyone tell me that? No, everything has to be loaded onto the employer as another tax. It is treated like the fringe benefits tax&mdash;someone gets a benefit, it is taxed and the employer has to pay.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard Mr Dawkins speaking on the radio this morning. He told us how this superannuation will make up a pool of funds which will increase manufacturing and production around Australia. He forgets that that money will come out of small business which is producing already. Those small businesses are the most efficient businesses we can get. The superannuation is coming out of small businesses. Small businesses will be closed down so Mr Dawkins can put in a big union controlled enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have seen where these funds were going to improve production and manufacturing in Australia. In Western Australia the Government employees superannuation scheme was ripped off by the State Government. The SGIO was ripped off by the State Government. Will this scheme be the same? I know that Mr Dawkins plans to build up something and even take over BHP. The Government has as much chance of taking over BHP as Chiang Kai-shek had of taking over mainland China again. Mr Dawkins will be shutting down efficient businesses and we will have union controlled outfits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Business cannot afford an increase of 5 per cent, let alone 4 per cent. Treasury has said that 100,000 jobs are on the line&mdash;Senator Kernot does not know that&mdash;and that does not include the 35 jobs that the Democrats helped unload last night. The worst case scenario is the loss of 100,000 jobs, supported by the Democrats. The Democrats do not worry about their conscience; they do not have a conscience when it comes to jobs. They unloaded 35 jobs in Western Australia last night and tonight at least another 80,000 jobs will be lost, on 4 per cent; 100,000 will be lost on 5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I repeat: Government senators are making decisions in matters with which they have never had experience. None of them, from I have heard, has ever paid a wage packet out in his or her life. How many wage packets has Senator West paid out? How many has Senator Tate paid out? I asked him that this afternoon by interjection, but he did not reply. I do not know one Government senator who has paid out one pay packet, yet those opposite have the audacity to come in here telling us what small business should and should not do&mdash;that it should keep continually paying whilst being taxed out of business. As an employer I am sick and tired of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will go halfway with any employee, as I have done for 20 years. For 20 years I have set up superannuation funds for my employees. I would meet an employee halfway on anything he wanted to contribute. When he left my employ&mdash;he did not have to stay with me&mdash;he got his entire entitlement and I said good luck to him. I told him, `If I can give you any advice from now on, I will do so and help you in your new job'. By working in that way, I have picked up virtually unemployed people and made citizens out of them. I can read out some recommendations just like those that Senator Evans reads out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I leave the issue there, except to repeat that there are 100,000 jobs on the line. Treasury has said that if this cost were to be completely added on to the unit labour cost we would lose 100,000 jobs. Can those opposite tell me how that cost is not going to be added on to the unit labour cost? I cannot see how with most jobs these days we get better productivity through the action of the employee. If there is any better productivity achieved, it is through better machinery, better technology and better managed technology. That is how it is going to be. I cannot see any employees' actions whatsoever going to increased productivity; therefore the superannuation guarantee levy will be a tax totally on the employer, and I can see those 100,000 jobs quite easily going out the door within a very few years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight, as has been said before, we are debating one of those watermark issues in the history of Australian politics and in the history of the provision of services and assistance to enable people to have a standard of living after their retirement which is above and beyond the poverty line.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must correct some of Senator Panizza's aspersions and comments in quoting Treasury figures. The<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 6 May for the hearing of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation records Mr Cole as having said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The material provided was not really Treasury analysis of the likely impact of the SGL on unemployment. The material provided was simply a simple exercise of modelling using assumptions that were provided in the question placed by Senator Alston.</PARA>
<PARA>The simple analysis goes with the simple minds that thought up the assumptions, I would suggest. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has long been known that, with economic modelling or indeed, any sort of modelling, with anything that uses computers to generate lots of numbers, garbage in produces garbage out.</PARA>
<PARA>It is the same as statistics: if we are dealing with figures, we have to start off with the right assumptions. Mr Cole continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On this occasion, the assumptions, as I say, were specified in the question, and the answers that came out were no more reasonable as an analysis of the likely effects of the superannuation guarantee levy on employment and unemployment, than the assumptions that were used in the question.</PARA>
<PARA>He further said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We pointed out in the answer that we were analysing and we were modelling the assumptions that were specified in the question. We pointed out that they were unreasonable and therefore that the result was not reasonable.</PARA>
<PARA>Those were the qualifications that Senator Panizza should have added when he was talking about what he alleges will happen. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think it was quite clear to any person who actually read the material. I am surprised that so many people, including economically literate journalists, have managed to misconstrue what was answering specific questions, which is what we were asked to do.</PARA>
<PARA>Those are the qualifications that should be always taken into consideration when assessing what the Opposition claim to be the facts relating to the effect of the SGL. It is very important to always do that and to pay those qualifications the respect they are due. We heard earlier tonight of the effect of ageing upon this community, of the dependency ratios, and that 21 per cent of people by something like the year 2025 will be of retirement age. We also know that we are encouraging young people to stay on longer at school. Therefore, it is obvious that with the declining population, but with the bulge of those of us who are baby boomers at the retired end, there must be fewer people actually in the work force providing income to the Government from which it then has to pay pensions. That is a fairly simple and straightforward piece of commonsense logic, I would have thought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other question one must ask from the way Opposition senators are acting by not wanting this type of thing to be introduced is whether they want an either/or situation. Do we pay to have our children educated&mdash;and we know that is something in the `Frightback' package&mdash;or do we pay to have our aged cared for and provided with services? One must assume they want us to make that choice, which I do not think is an appropriate choice to have to make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been many issues raised tonight in this debate, one about women. In `Frightback' we are told that spouses will be able to make contributions on behalf of their non-working spouse or partner, which is usually, on the part of the Opposition, said to be a woman. The maximum contribution is $12,000 each. I ask those opposite: how many families in this country can afford to put aside $24,000 each year for their superannuation? It is just typical of everything that this Opposition does. Those opposite are not living in the reality of what the average person has to live with, has to work with and has to exist on out there in the world; they are working on the assumption that everybody is getting at least average weekly earnings, and a heck of a lot more. </PARA>

The sum of $24,000 out of a salary package is enormous. For some families it is the whole salary package. Senator Panizza is making assumptions, like a number of people have made assumptions in this debate, that people can afford to do things. We are aiming for a situation where people are able to afford to do more things with their incomes at the end of their lives when they are able to enjoy some part time occupation or to participate in activities which require a little more money than that provided by the pension.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been reminded by Senator Giles, as she like me is a former nurse, that it was not until the late 1970s, early 1980s, that nurses in Western Australia were able to take out superannuation. They were not eligible for some of the State superannuation schemes. Often, the older women may be single and may not have moved out of nursing homes.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is reviewing. Perhaps Senator Panizza wants to review it more after he has been reminded of what Professor Knox had to say to us. Professor Knox said, `The hypothetical question is: so should we proceed with SGL?' In reply to his own question, Professor Knox said, `I suggest we should'. He then went on to talk about a couple of areas that we should look at. He thought that, to improve the cost efficiency of the SGL, two areas needed to be looked at. One was an increase in the threshold, which is part of the Government amendments that we will be moving.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other area relates to the frequency with which contributions are paid. Professor Knox's suggestion was 12-monthly. We have not agreed to that, but we have certainly looked at six- and three-monthly. I suggest that obviously there has been accommodation there. Basically, as Professor Knox said, we should proceed. He said that we should not remove the option for low income earners to have access to superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Knox also dealt very well with compulsion. He thought that there was a need for a compulsory core and an optional extra. He put the compulsory core of the employer contribution in the range of 7 per cent to 12 per cent. He thought that, if it were appropriate for there to be an employee contribution, employees would need a tax incentive. That is almost straight Government policy, but the Opposition chooses not to take note of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Knox is not the only person who has said that there is a need for compulsion. The Business Council of Australia informed the Senate Select Committee that there is an emerging consensus across the industry and employer groups that some form of compulsory payment is necessary. The Metal Trades Industry Association, in its original submission, also supported the general principle of compulsion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr O'Sullivan from Noble Lowndes also supported a minimum contribution of 10 per cent, including member contributions. Mercer, Campbell, Cook and Knight support maximum employer and employee contributions. Mr Davis from the Small Business Association thought that there should be mandatory employer and employee contributions, as did Mr Mansfield. It is not as though the Government is out on its own in thinking that there should be compulsory superannuation. That is very important for people to realise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Panizza mentioned the superannuation system in Italy in his address. I hasten to add that in Italy the employer contribution ranges between 14.8 per cent and 30.43 per cent. The employee contribution is 6.1 per cent to 10.79 per cent. That means that in some areas about 66 per cent of the employees' total contributions are made up of compulsory employer contributions. They end up with 80 per cent of their final career earnings as their pension. That is a very significant contribution by the employers. Obviously, they get the benefits at the end of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been said before, New Zealand is the only country of those that we surveyed in this Committee that does not have some employer contribution. It has none and it is obviously striking some major financial problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has said that we should enable people to have freedom of choice. I wonder what would happen if people had freedom of choice to opt in and out of the superannuation insurance field as they chose. Like all those people who take out optional extra superannuation insurance, they would be badgered and harassed by sales persons from all the life insurance companies who, carefully on some occasions, do not fully explain things, or do not leave their possible future clients with a full understanding of their fees and charges. We have heard some comment from the Opposition about administrative charges on the SGL. I suggest that we would have to address this problem for not only the SGL people but everybody involved in superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An annoyed self-employed gentleman&mdash;a farmer&mdash;rang me last week. He had been paying into a superannuation fund, which he had set up late in life in 1981, for about 10 or 11 years. He was planning to retire in the near future. He thought, when he was seeking to set up this fund, that he had given adequate instructions so that he would be able to maximise his money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This gentleman has made a contribution of just over $18,000 since 1981. In the account balance late last year there was just over $26,000. If he had taken the $1,200 which he contributed each year&mdash;plus in the two years he had a good wool clip he contributed an extra $1,800 twice&mdash;invested it in the banks and paid tax, he would have had a greater amount of money on which to plan his retirement income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Administrative charges, fees and costs are not just a problem for the SGL people. They are a problem that the Select Committee will be addressing in its third report. To me this highlights the problems that this aspect brings to it and that is one of the reasons why we have suggested that quarterly payments into the funds will reduce the number of transactions which are made, and therefore reduce some of the administration costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very important issue. We keep hearing that there should be freedom of choice and that it is not the right time to make changes. I suggest to some people that it is never the right time to make changes to anything such as this. It is never the right time to make changes to things that are of importance and significance to people. It should always be voluntary. If that were the case, we would still have slavery and children working down the mines and in factories. We would still be working 80 hours a week and that type of thing. Those reforms were fought for very hard and were only accomplished when they were made compulsory reforms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that in this case, if we are going to do something about people's retirement incomes, we have to have an element of compulsion to make sure that people do have something to look forward to in their retirement. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the bringing together of employers and employed . . . whose interests are identical, who depend on each other, (should) never be in unnatural antagonism without deplorable result.</PARA>
<PARA>The unnatural antagonism of the ACTU towards employers in this country will be at the expense of its own members; those very members whom Treasury has openly admitted will ultimately pay for the scheme with reductions in real wages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Superannuation Legislation (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill, the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Bill, the Superannuation Guarantee Charge Bill and the Superannuation Guarantee (Consequential Amendments) Bill before us tonight reflect a government driven by an ACTU agenda. The ACTU failed to secure a second round of 3 per cent award superannuation. However, it has achieved its purpose using another formula and another forum&mdash;a sympathetic Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The superannuation guarantee levy is a compulsory scheme to pander to the ACTU, giving it what the IRC denied. The Government and the ACTU are telling businesses and the Parliament that the levy will be paid for from wage increases not claimed and granted. Yet, behind the backs of their hands they are telling employees that employers will pay for the extra superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While some Government members tell us that the extra super will be in lieu of wage rises, ACTU Assistant Secretary, Iain Ross, has confirmed that there would be room for a national wage rise in 1992-93, over and above the wage rises taken in the form of superannuation as a result of the superannuation guarantee levy. He expects inflation to stay down and to have SGL and 5 per cent and pay rises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the bottom line someone must pay for the $122m cost to business, and taxpayers will have to fund the $500m-plus for the extra social security costs and the cost of personal taxation revenue forgone in the rising unemployment. Not only will there be rising unemployment as a result of this levy, but also there will be a drain out of savings from business into superannuation funds, certainly during the short to medium term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Treasury has now done its arithmetic. It seems to have progressed from the back of the envelope stage to predicting an increase in national savings of one per cent of GDP by the year 2005 and 1.5 per cent in 40 years. So it is a long wait. In fact, it was interesting to listen to the Treasury officials before the Committee. When they first appeared it was fairly evident that this scheme had been prepared by the Government without a great deal of Treasury support and backing. But at a late stage they were forced to come in and defend the indefensible. We felt a tinge of sadness for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to the chamber that this levy will not be sufficient to foot the bill for the extra unemployed. We also need to know whether this figure takes into account cessation of double dipping, because if it does not the result is entirely false. While it is possible for employees to take their lump sum and spend it and then apply for the aged pension&mdash;and this will continue&mdash;there will be little appreciable difference to national savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the matters which ought to be addressed instead of applying this crippling blanket legislation are the raising of the preservation age to 60 years; restricting access to lump sums; gradually aligning the aged pension for men and women; encouraging employees to contribute to the cost of their own retirement; allowing part time and casual employees to have access to low cost alternative superannuation arrangements; abolishing the compulsory retirement age; and providing for deferred pensions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The SGL is to be added to the award superannuation provision and will further add to inequities and complexities as far as the overall picture is concerned. The whole regime is built on an inequitable foundation and will tend to exacerbate poverty and hardship in both the short and the longer term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The levy requires no direct employee contribution and as such is quite fairly unique in the world. In fact, representatives from Coles Myer put to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Until superannuation becomes a joint responsibility and is included in adjustments to labour costs, employees will have no commitment to providing for their own retirement. Whilst superannuation is seen as an input based on workforce participation rather than attempting to quantify an appropriate end benefit we cannot say that there is an effective and workable retirement incomes policy in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>The imposition of the levy will not lead to efficient investment, contrary to that stated by the Government members. It has a bias to one form of savings and it erodes individual freedom of choice. In contrast to this, the coalition's Fightback superannuation package preserves freedom of choice and tackles the problem of national savings by generous concessions which will greatly encourage personal retirement savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the proposed start-up date of 1 July, employers with annual payrolls of over $1m will be asked to contribute 4 per cent of each employee's earnings up to a maximum of $80,000 to any complying fund. This means, on average, $4,000 per employee. The bill for the nation's employers for all this is estimated at $122 billion: $22 billion for small businesses and $100 billion for major companies. The contributions will rise progressively to 9 per cent by the year 2002. Extra to these employer contributions, a further 3 per cent is to be negotiated on a wage tax trade-off. According to the newspapers, a possible deal on those figures has occurred with the Democrats, and I look forward to viewing the Government's amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although some negotiation has resulted in amendments and we now have a situation in the Bills where employees who earn less than $450 a month will be exempt, unfortunately there is no general exemption from the charges for an employer whose annual national payroll is less than a certain specified minimum. We, as a coalition, suggest that employers whose income is exempt from income tax and whose annual national payroll is below the training guarantee threshold, for example, should be exempt. This would cover the situation of small charitable organisations, in particular, which are in a poor position to meet these proposed requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another suggested improvement is that proposed section 61 should be altered to delete the words `is under 55 but'. An employee who retires because of illness above the age of 55 should not be in any worse position. I put it to the Senate that, despite the fact that this legislation has gone to a committee, it still has lots of imperfections and technical problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The levy will be payable by employers who fail to meet the minimum level of contribution. It is to be paid to the Taxation Office as a non-deductible levy to be redistributed to employees. In addition, an administrative charge by the Taxation Office must first be met by the employers in respect of each employee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to contrast the situation which I have been examining with a letter from Quentin Gomes of Harquep Enterprises in Perth. I hope he is listening tonight. He expresses succinctly the agony which has been voiced in many of the submissions which came to members of the Committee. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite working 60 to 70 hours a week only to survive in the current economic climate, we just never seem to be able to make a quid. We are simply exhausted just fighting to stay alive and the only thought the Government has, is to extract more and more taxes squeezing the last drop of blood out of the small business community.</PARA>
<PARA>Those are the words of a small businessman. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the face of huge unemployment, is this how the Government expects us to create new jobs by sending the very job creators to the wall? If we, the small businesses die, so will many of our employees. [There will] be none of us left to retire.</PARA>
<PARA>The ACTU has claimed that the reason for its hurry is the demographic projection that the ratio of Australians of working age to those over 65 years will fall from 5 : 1 at present to 3 : 1 by 2031. However, these figures are very flawed. They do not allow for a reduction in the cost of maintaining the young or the capacity of the Australian economy to enable people to save more and therefore provide for their own retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many problems with the legislation which will also add to the confusion. The law is too complex for employers to administer, especially when they are required to do so on a monthly basis. Not all funds are award based and the legislation presumes that all superannuation comes under schemes run by large insurance companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Additionally, it is envisaged&mdash;despite the protestation of Government members&mdash;that the super funds' costs will rise. In fact, I am most concerned about a comment from the Taxation Office made in relation to the Taxpayers Association submission about the need to pay monthly contributions. It says that all the funds would need to do is change their methods and trust deeds and pay monthly. In other words, according to this communication, high costs and administrative problems appear to be of no concern to the Australian Taxation Office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area of concern is that the legislation is not clear in respect of wages and salaries. In fact, I foresee much litigation arising from this problem. With regard to fringe benefits, the then Treasurer, the Hon. John Kerin, in a 1991 information paper said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Salary or wages for purposes of the SGL will not include eligible termination payments, retiring allowances, pension annuity payments, fringe benefits and some education and training allowances.</PARA>
<PARA>I think we need to be given a definite indication of whether this is still the case. It must be made clear that ordinary time earnings in proposed section 6(1) do not include fringe benefits in the same way that this is made clear for salaries and wages in proposed section 11(3). Further, the guidelines contain no exemption in respect of the employee if the employer is prohibited by the RBL rules or otherwise from making further contributions, although there are some small amendments in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Definitional problems also occur with what constitutes a resident. A definition is needed to cover visiting employees to Australia by overseas companies. I also perceive problems in the charge for interest. In fact, it is for a flat 58 weeks, regardless of the period of the year in which the shortage occurred. Although guaranteed payments would not be due until, say, 14 August after the end of the financial year, the employer would be required to calculate interest rates from the beginning of the year in question until the date on which the superannuation guarantee charge in relation to the total would be payable. Such a draconian provision leaves me speechless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Problems with the definition of an employee also occur. The Bill defines employees as covering the executive bodies of companies, people engaged under contract where the contract is wholly or principally for the supply of labour, members of Parliament, performers or presenters of entertainment or sport and members of local government councils. No wonder the Government is moving on the independent contractors area. It wants to try to rope them into this legislation as well. In other words, the levy is going to have an adverse effect on people such as solicitors who act as executive directors of companies. The levy requires that employers must make contributions in respect of persons who act as non-executive directors of companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because the legislation exempts the self-employed, it is going to cause a rush into the small contractor situation as subcontracting of labour is closed off as an option by the imposition of the SGL. This will also backlash against unions by costing them membership as unemployment increases. This is what the Keating Government is desperately trying to cover up by forcing its proposed draconian contractor legislation through the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are of course problems in respect of subcontract labourers with this levy. Many trades and professions already operate with a large subcontractor work force or the hiring out of skilled labour. In fact, we have seen an increase in the number of canvas workers because of anomalies in the sales tax legislation. Problems arise with plumbers and electricians. These are one-man businesses which will all remain outside the legislation, as will the self-employed, Government employees, non-residents and those over 65 or under 18. All of these groups will be exempt from the superannuation guarantee levy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those businesses which continue to subcontract labour will be in an obscure and very difficult position. There will be an increase in self-employment by people who have little or no expertise in business as those who have been subcontracting labour can no longer afford to do so because they are forced to pay the levy, and they will stop using the services of subcontractors. Where additional cost can be carried, it will quickly be passed on to the consumers of the services, increasing the cost of living for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Legislation to stop independent contractors from operating is a most iniquitous assault on private enterprise and personal freedom and will not solve the Government's or the unions' problems. In fact, it will exacerbate the problems created by this levy and hamstring small scale private enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another major concern is the need to amend trust deeds to make the funds comply from 1 July to requirements such as the vesting provisions. There have been real concerns as to whether trust deeds must be changed before the law is passed and proclaimed. The penalties for non-compliance are severe. The possibility of inadvertent errors is great with unclear situations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is regrettable that the Bill lacks transitional arrangements. An example of this is the New South Wales Coal Association, which has a very long established fund which now does not comply with the provisions relating to funding and vesting. In closing the old fund, it has had to make top-ups because of the need for additional funds so that the scheme can provide the entitlements outlined by the deed. But with this changeover, it will not be able to avoid having to pay a charge under the charge provisions, even though its contributions are substantially in excess of the specified rate. It is an iniquitous situation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There will also be considerable costs in moving from non-complying to complying funds in cases such as this. There are other organisations paying well in excess of the levy which will end up paying twice because of the complexities of complying and non-complying funds. It is a most iniquitous situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An employer should not incur the superannuation guarantee charge through contributions it makes to a non-complying fund, if at the time of making them it had reasonable grounds to believe that the fund would receive complying status for the year in question. Again, I think the Government has moved slightly in this regard by way of a recent amendment. But it has done absolutely nothing to provide for transitional arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is likely that many employers will provide superannuation guarantee benefits by contributing to externally managed superannuation funds, whether established by a union, an industry body or a financial organisation. In some cases, employers will agree to contribute to whichever fund an employee may select. It would be grossly unjust if the employer incurred the charge because the fund was later classified as non-complying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also raise a technical problem for predecessor funds under proposed sections 13 and 14. These provisions will operate as a disincentive for the amalgamation of superannuation funds. It seems that the successors to the schemes that were in existence as at 30 August 1991 with an earnings base no narrower than the original scheme was, under the information paper released in December 1991, given the same treatment in relation to their earning bases as funds in existence as at that date. So many employers would have proceeded on the basis that successive schemes were to be given the same treatment. Again, this charge and change is inequitable. One cannot rely on early Government information and proceed on that basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further problem with the SGL levy is the affordability of voluntary organisations and associations, for example, in the disability area. Where these organisations are currently in receipt of government support, they will need to be assured of additional funds in the government contribution to cover the levy or the charge, otherwise their services will be curtailed. I appeal to the Minister, Senator Tate, to give the Senate the assurance that the Government will maintain the real level of funding benefit to enable the payment of the guarantee levy by these organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation will extend provisions for retirement savings, yet there has been no consideration of people who are not in the work force or who work part time. The small amount of part time work situation includes mostly women who, for at least part of their lives, are not in the paid work force and can have a break of only a few years. This aspect of the legislation is especially disturbing in the light of the trend towards job sharing and the desirability of this trend in helping to offset rising unemployment and family and social problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A vast majority of almost three million women are outside the paid work force. They have no access to superannuation, and they are especially vulnerable in their old age and in the event of widowhood or divorce. Of the 1.3 million casual workers in Australia, 63 per cent are women, and a high proportion are migrant women who are already subject to heavy discrimination from union executives. Eighty per cent of the 1.9 million Australians of working age who are not in the work force are women. There is no protection for these people under the legislation. In addition, there are many ways in which these people will bear the brunt of escalating costs as businesses raise prices to try to pay for the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By requiring 3 to 4 per cent contributions for everyone earning more than $3,000 a year, most of the savings, if not all at the lower levels, will be taken up by charges and the employee will be forced to go without increases that the employer could otherwise have afforded to pay. The guarantee legislation increases discrimination against women by widening the gap and by its blatant failure to address such a problem. In order to address this discriminatory problem, the coalition has a provision to allow workers to contribute up to $6,000 a year on a tax concessional basis for non-working spouses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further problem with the SGL is its effect on State governments. In fact, the head of the South Australian Treasury, Mr Peter Emery, told the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> that the introduction of the levy would cost South Australia $35m and could jeopardise an estimated 1,000 public sector jobs. Similar figures have come in from other States, indicating that there has to be some adjustment in this area. In Tasmania the cost will be about $12m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unfortunate that at this late stage of the parliamentary sitting this legislation is being rushed through with complete disregard for the many good submissions received and tabled by the Select Committee. It is disastrous in its fundamental philosophy of removing the right of individuals to plan for retirement in their chosen way, placing the onus on employers who cannot afford it, who will be looking for ways to pass on the cost. I would like to end with the concluding remarks of a letter which I quoted from earlier by Quentin Gomes from Perth:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We strongly object to the Guarantee Tax and implore you not to pass it through the Senate. Your rejection will mean giving us, the drowning small businessman, a hand to stay afloat, who in turn will keep at least those who have a job in employment and avoid the soul destroying exercise of lining them up on the dole queue.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the remarks of my colleague Senator Watson and the very great concerns expressed by other colleagues on this side of the chamber in this debate on the Superannuation Legislation (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 1992 and related Bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> These superannuation Bills are before the Parliament because they represent ACTU policy. A key component of the ACTU accord mark VI is superannuation. As we all know, the IRC failed to agree with the Keating-Kelty push for compulsory superannuation. Instead the IRC recommended a national conference on retirement incomes. As a result the Government has now decided on compulsion through legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is the ACTU so obsessed with superannuation? I would suggest to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that the ACTU is not noted for its long term perspective on so many other aspects of industry policy. We have seen how vigorously the ACTU and its cohorts have fought over the years to prevent the very real productivity improvements which could have been made in this economy and which could have sustained higher living standards than we now have. Why is it that suddenly this organisation has decided that it has to address the central issue of the ability of a government of any complexion, some 20 to 30 years out, to pay the pension bill? Why is it that Mr Keating and Mr Kelty have suddenly focused on this issue and are ramming this legislation through the Parliament this evening?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that the ACTU, having presided over a real cut in living standards&mdash;an astonishing thing under a Labor government&mdash;believes that compulsory superannuation will assist in signing up members. As we all know, the membership of unions is falling. It has fallen over the period of this Labor Government, despite all the attempts of the Government to bolster the power and privileges of unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The funds accumulated in these union controlled funds will provide the unions with a source of political power and influence over industry and the direction of investment funds. I remind the Senate of what Mr Keating said at the ACTU Congress in 1989. I think this quotation from Mr Keating lays the basis for and gives the reason why we have this legislation before us this evening. Mr Keating said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the trade unions at any time are placed in a more hostile political environment, they will face it not only with their negotiating power in the labour market, they will face it being a significant controlling element in the $600 billion savings.</PARA>
<PARA>These Bills are not focused on concern for the problems that some future government may have in funding retirement incomes. It is not concern about the living standards of Australian workers. It is not concern about the comparatively poor levels of national savings in this country. These Bills are basically about one thing&mdash;union power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These Bills help fulfil the ambitions outlined in perhaps one of the most reactionary documents ever brought into the public arena, certainly in the last 20 years: <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia Reconstructed</EMPHASIS>. One of the thrusts of that document was to develop union influenced and union controlled superannuation funds. The union movement wants compulsorily required savings of employees as a vehicle to maintain its influence and power in the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know why the Labor Government and the ACTU support this legislation. What is surprising to me is that it is also supported by the Australian Democrats. I suggest that the question before this Parliament is why the Australian Democrats have been suckered into supporting this disgraceful deal. I do not recall any survey of Australian workers to see whether they would prefer compulsory superannuation arrangements, which would limit their choice of savings options and, effectively, in some industries result in the loss of jobs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Alston has confirmed, basically the workers were not asked. There was a very good reason for that. If the workers had been told that there may be some trade-off in wage increases, in living standards and in the ability of workers to decide what to do with their savings rather than to allow a union controlled or union influenced fund to decide what to do with their savings, the union officials may have been met with a resounding no.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last week or so, Senator Spindler discovered that jobs are the real issue in this Parliament. So each day in this chamber he has taken almost every opportunity to let us know about his new discovery that jobs are important. It is somewhat ironical that the Democrats, who have opposed all major mining developments, fought all forestry developments, sought to tie up the rural industry in green tape and supported virtually all major legislation to increase union power, now show some concern for jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How fair dinkum is this newly found concern of the Australian Democrats for jobs? We have all read about the hard-fought negotiations between Senator Kernot, Treasurer John Dawkins and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Senator McMullan.

So he should, because on the basis of what he aimed to achieve I suggest that he did pretty well. On the basis of what Senator Kernot and the Democrats aimed to achieve, I suggest that, at least measured by the standards of the national interest, they did pretty badly.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill will impose an additional tax on employers of between $2 billion and $3 billion per year. It is worth recording&mdash;Senator Reid drew this to our attention&mdash;that we had a Bill before the chamber this morning which concerned the training guarantee levy. This levy imposes some $700m to $800m on employer payrolls. I thought Les Hollings in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Telegraph</EMPHASIS> of 21 June summed it all up rather well. Let me refresh your memory, Mr Acting Deputy President, as I know you are a keen reader of that newspaper, as to what Les Hollings said:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How callous can politicians get?</PARA>
<PARA>I ask you, Mr Acting Deputy President: how callous can Senator Kernot and the Australian Democrats get? It is clear that Senator Kernot is acutely sensitive about the jobs issue and about how this particular legislation will cut employment. This is what Senator Kernot said of her handiwork:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do not accept that no jobs will be lost as a result of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>You will notice that that is a double negative, Mr Acting Deputy President. She went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are asking the Government to negotiate on reasonable proposals to minimise the impact on business and jobs in the short run.</PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps we will not lose 100,000 jobs; perhaps Senator Kernot would be content with the loss of 60,000 or 50,000 jobs. That is what Senator Kernot said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> recently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened very carefully to Senator Kernot's speech. I came into the chamber particularly to listen to it. I say to her and to her fellow Democrats: how many jobs has this particular effort of theirs cost? What is their estimate? Employers, who after all have to pay the money, believe that the job losses will be substantial. The Confederation of Australian Industry estimates that job losses will be between 60,000 and 180,000. Mr Ian Spicer said that the deal done was `an incomprehensible decision' that would reduce investment prospects, boost inflation and make the economy less competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Returns of a survey of some 824 firms undertaken by the CAI indicated that, of those which indicated the superannuation guarantee levy would lead to an increase in costs, three out of four firms will respond to the levy by employing fewer people. The General Manager of the Queensland Confederation of Industry said that the Democrat deal would `force manufacturing industries to go off-shore and place jobs in countries other than Australia'. Other industry groups make the same point. In my own State, the Victorian Automobile Chamber of Commerce indicates that there will be lost jobs and lost job opportunities as a result of this measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Spindler, like many in this chamber, has expressed concern about the state of the car industry. This industry is suffering very low margins and, in many areas, serious losses. This new found concern of Senator Spindler came as a bit of a surprise to me. Senator Spindler strongly favours public transport over road transport; he supports additional fuel taxes and transport taxes in an attempt to encourage people to forgo their cars and use public transport. The Senate will recall that yesterday Senator Spindler and his colleagues strongly supported an additional tariff on imported used cars in order to protect the local car industry. Today Senator Spindler and his colleagues reverted to type and decided to support an extra tax on the car industry&mdash;the superannuation levy. Senator Spindler has also expressed concern about the state of the textile, clothing and footwear industries; today he decided to help them along a little by agreeing to impose an extra tax on them. The superannuation guarantee levy is an extra payroll tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax increases will not end there. State governments around Australia will have to find an extra $300m over the next year to fund the increase imposed by the Keating Government. According to estimates that I have read, the $300m will rise to over $1.5 billion by the end of the century. Where will State governments get this money from? Mr Acting Deputy President, you will know that the Government in your home State of Tasmania is particularly strapped for funds. I suggest that the governments will get the money through additional State taxes and charges, some of which will undoubtedly fall on industry&mdash;particularly if it is a Labor government&mdash;including the car industry and the TCF industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even on the most conservative estimates, the Superannuation Guarantee Charge Bill will cost tens of thousands of jobs.

The Australian Democrats have made a particular point of building up links with welfare lobbies. Much of the rhetoric of the Australian Democrats emphasises their alleged concern for the underprivileged. The coalition of welfare groups, led by the Australian Council of Social Service and including the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation, has said that the superannuation deal would make low income earners, women, and casual and part time workers forgo wage increases now and in the future for little or no long term gain.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The superannuation guarantee legislation, an attempt by the Government to circumvent the Industrial Relations Commission's refusal to deliver a second 3 per cent superannuation in last April's national wage case, is the product of a deal struck in a meeting at the Lodge between former Prime Minister Hawke, two of his ministers, and the ACTU secretary Bill Kelty, and president, Martin Ferguson.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effect of the legislation is to establish a compulsory minimum level of employer contributions of between 9 and 12 per cent. The mandatory contribution level was originally to be set at 3 per cent for businesses with annual payrolls of $500,000 or less, and at 5 per cent for all other employers, with both minima rising to at least 9 per cent by the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, after pressure from the Democrats the Government has agreed that the mandatory contribution level will initially be set at 3 per cent for businesses with annual payrolls of $1 million or less, with both minima rising to at least 9 per cent by the year 2002.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The superannuation guarantee levy is intended to work in a similar way to the training guarantee levy. Where an employer makes contributions at a rate lower than the compulsory level, a tax will be imposed on the employer. The total tax payable in each case will consist of; (a) the difference between the amount of contributions payable at the legislated minimum rate and the amount of contributions actually made, (b) an interest component based on the rate for underpayments and overpayments of income tax (currently 14.026% per annum), and (c) an administration charge, consisting of a flat amount of $50 plus an amount of $30 for each affected employee.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a recent speech made in Perth, Professor Ross Garnaut, an economist at the Australian National University, and author of "Australia and the Northeast Asian Ascendancy" (a 1989 report, loudly acclaimed by the Government), argued that the key to sustained economic growth is improved international competitiveness. Three of the five elements he identifies as being vital to Australia's competitiveness will suffer a negative impact under the Government's proposed scheme: (a) economy-wide costs and prices relative to international costs and prices, (b) the relative cost of capital, especially interest rates, and (c) the capacity to lift labour productivity in individual workplaces.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will outline the likely effects of the SGL legislation on each of these elements in more detail below, but at this point it can be noted that; (a) Treasury forecasts have indicated that the introduction of the scheme will boost inflation by two percentage points, (b) the interposition of an additional layer of intermediation in the financial markets (required because of the conservative investment programmes of the swelling superannuation funds) between major lenders and small to medium-sized borrowers will result in increased interest rates, and (c) the legislated increase in contributions (purportedly in lieu of wages growth) significantly reduces the scope for productivity based negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thus, the Government plans to proceed with legislation which clearly ignores the policy implications of its own apparent concurrence with Garnaut's position. They have been bullied into this self-contradictory and pathetic position by the ACTU. The threat from Bill Kelty that the Accord would be "dead" if the Government failed to deliver increased compulsory superannuation is clearly the driving force behind the Government's proposed reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) UNEMPLOYMENT</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the shadow Minister for Social Security, Child Care and Retirement Incomes, Senator Richard Alston, has pointed out, the Government's employer paid superannuation scheme amounts to a $4 billion payroll tax, and is "the last thing business needs if it is to be able to get up off the floor".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislated superannuation increases will, in all likelihood, represent a simple "add-on" to existing labour costs. Increased unit labour costs will, in turn, lead to a reduction in business retained earnings. The distressing but inevitable outcome will be higher unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Results from the Murphy Model indicate that implementation of the proposed scheme will cost more than 100,000 Australians their jobs over the next three years, an increase in unemployment of one quarter of a percentage point by the second quarter of 1994. This painful employment effect will be associated with a relative decline in production by one half of a percentage point during the same period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's claim that the cost of superannuation contribution increases will be off-set by wages restraint is not to be believed. As the former Treasurer John Kerin admitted of the Government's wages policy, "We don't exactly know where we're going". The Government has now agreed, under duress, to put the principle of absorbing the cost of the SGL into wage demands over the next 10 years into legislative form, but it is doubtful that this Government's legislative guarantees can withstand the power of the ACTU. Indeed, regardless of the Government's statements of intent, the first scheduled increase in superannuation to apply from 1 July 1992 will unavoidably constitute a simple add-on to the current price of labour.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The timing of the scheme's introduction exacerbates its negative impact on employment. In the existing, already weak, labour market, any cost increases on employers can be expected to affect employment even more. Likewise, the arbitrary and inflexible timetable for future increases in minimum employer contributions during the 1990s, has the potential to play havoc with the economy, and will almost certainly have continuing, significant, deleterious effects on the level of employment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Which raises the question of whether or not the ACTU really cares about the 10.4 per cent unemployed in this country. The much vaunted wages trade-off for superannuation is either a delusion or a ruse. In reality what the ACTU and the Government have devised is an uncaring, irresponsible, short-sighted, "jobs for super" trade-off.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) INFLATION</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As noted above, reducing economy-wide costs and prices relative to international costs and prices is essential if Australia is to improve its international competitiveness and thereby achieve sustainable economic growth. In this respect, the SGL legislation is the opposite of what is actually required. It places a huge burden on business which will, in part, have to be passed on in the form of higher prices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Results from the Murphy Model of the Australian economy indicate that the increase in unit labour costs to be brought about by the SGL legislation will lead to an increase in inflation by one third of a percentage point by the second quarter of 1993, rising over the subsequent 12 months to an increase of more than two percentage points.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Button has previously argued in the Chamber that compulsory increases in employer contributions will take the place of, rather than be in addition to, substantial wages growth, and that this is a position the Government shares with the ACTU. However, although the ACTU Executive has announced a decision to "defer consideration of the timing and quantum of a claim for a National Wage adjustment", following its February meeting it emphasised its on-going commitment to press for further inflation-linked wages growth, and it is now clear that the ACTU expects to secure real wage increases in 1992-3. With inflation running at 2 per cent, it is thought that a nominal wage increase of 3 per cent will be the ACTU's likely target.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Obviously then, the claim that unit labour costs, and thus prices, will not be boosted by increases in the minimum level of compulsory employer contributions, is fantastical.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) SAVINGS AND INVESTMENT</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the main arguments advanced by the Government in support of the proposed scheme is that it will lead to an increase in the pool of national savings upon which Australian industry can draw for investment purposes. Indeed, Senator Cook has described the SGL legislation as "a significant investment boon to the economy". Unfortunately, for the Government, this claim is yet to be substantiated. On 15 April 1992, just ten weeks before the Government intended for the scheme to commence, Treasury officials told the Senate select committee on superannuation that they had not yet calculated the impact of the SGL on aggregate national savings. That is, they could not say with any degree of certainty what the savings/investment effect of the scheme would be. Several weeks later however, Treasury was arguing in its submission to the Senate Committee that the SGL would lead to an increase in national savings, by three per cent of GDP over the period to 2020.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, as the minority report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation states:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Treasury remains deeply sceptical concerning. . . [the SGL] proposal about which it was not consulted and to which it had no policy input. It was simply required to take on board an Accord deal and massage it through the Parliament. (p 89)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In fact, overseas experience suggests that the net effect on national savings from superannuation schemes is negligible, but that there is a significant effect on the composition of savings and investment. The implications of this compositional change are important and will be examined below. But first, it is worth considering arguments in favour of the CAI's assertion that rather than acting to raise the level of national savings, the SGL legislation will actually lead to a fall in the pool of funds available for business investment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The CAI has argued that there are "strong reasons to believe that aggregate savings in the Australian economy will diminish" as a result of the introduction of the scheme contained in the SGL legislation. The argument is that superannuation payments made by employers will act as a drain on business retained earnings, the very funds which profitable businesses draw on to invest in their own expansion. As well as reducing business savings, lower levels of profitability discourage the establishment of new enterprises. Thus, in opposition to Senator Cook's claim, in the view of Australian industry, the SGL legislation is far from "a significant investment boon".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Furthermore, as Senator Alston argued recently in the "Australian Financial Review":</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Forcing employers to provide a minimum level of superannuation without any commensurate employee contribution is likely to lead workers to vacate the field. . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The OECD has already warned of the principle at work here:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Increased institutional saving, in the absence of more general improvements in the incentive to save, may result only in the substitution of increased superannuation savings by lower saving in other forms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even the Treasury was forced to acknowledge the effect of the potential operation of this substitution or "switching" on its projections for an increase in national savings as a result of the SGL legislation:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some substitution can be expected, however,. . . there is unlikely to be complete substitution. No estimate of the likely magnitude of this effect is available. (p 88 Sen Com)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the minority report of the Senate Committee noted:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there is likely to be a very considerable switching effect. . . Therefore it cannot be said with any degree of confidence that there will be any particular increase in savings as a result of the SGL scheme. (P 88)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The obvious point is, that to legislate for a given level of savings is ineffective. To improve savings, what the Government must do is implement policies which increase the incentive to save. National Mutual has estimated that given the Government's over-reliance on compulsory superannuation contributions, its proposed rate of 9 to 12 per cent will fall well short of the 15 per cent rate needed to even begin to counter the growing constraint on public sector savings formed by the increasing social welfare bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The broader implications of a continued poor level of national savings, or of a further reduction in the same, which the SGL legislation looks set to achieve, are extremely serious. The ANZ Bank has estimated that national savings must be increased to 21 or 22 per cent of GDP simply in order to stabilise our level of foreign debt. And, to begin to reduce foreign debt, savings must reach a rate of at least one quarter of GDP.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The inadequacy of Government savings/investment policy was highlighted recently in comments made by Anthony Berg, the Managing Director of Macquarie Bank. He stated that the Government's existing focus on superannuation is not sufficient to build Australia's domestic savings up to a level which would enable the restructuring and expansion of the country's manufacturing industry, and noted that the likely, but undesirable, outcome was that investors will be forced offshore for capital, thereby further adding to Australia's existing, excessive $144 772 billion net foreign debt.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now, I would like to return to the important question of the likely effects of the SGL legislation on the composition of national savings (as opposed to the aggregate level of national savings), and its further consequences for the general pattern of investment in Australia. The ANZ Bank, supported by the Industry Commission, has pointed out that compulsory superannuation has the potential to "distort national savings in favour of super funds, causing the cost of bank funding to rise". At the proposed mandatory levels of 9 to 12 per cent, the potential impact of this distortion is inevitably greater. The massive transfer of capital from the banks to superannuation funds which will occur under the Government's scheme will operate to disadvantage borrowers, through at least two different mechanisms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, the conservative investment policies of superannuation funds mean that they customarily invest only in secure, long term projects. They typically place funds into equities, property and fixed interest securities. Medium-sized and small businesses have accordingly tended to rely on banks as a source of finance. Thus, the SGL legislation will cause the pool of funds available to borrowers from banks to shrink, thereby increasing the difficulty of obtaining finance for medium-sized and small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Second, even if, as the Treasury has argued, superannuation funds begin to provide finance to these borrowers through intermediaries (who are already expert direct lenders), the extra layer of intermediation required, is likely to add to the cost of borrowing. Either way, small to medium-sized borrowers are sure to lose out.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) LIVING STANDARDS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is axiomatic that superannuation increases do not help maintain current living standards. Understandably, low income earners especially will always prefer pay rises in the form of wages. If the Government's claim that increased compulsory employer contributions will significantly reduce "wage growth from other sources" does turn out to be accurate, the SGL legislation clearly poses a threat to current living standards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Low-income earners, as those most unable to afford any kind of "disposable income for savings" swap, thus have most reason to fear the Government's proposed scheme. On the other hand, if inflation-linked wages growth is simply awarded on top of increases in the level of compulsory employer contributions, both savers and consumers can expect to see the value of their earnings eaten away by price increases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f) RETIREMENT INCOMES</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's plans regarding the future of the age pension and the role of the SGL legislation in these plans, are sketchy, and to the extent that they can be made out, appear to hold no great promise for either future retirees, or the ever-shrinking section of the population who will generate the income required to support them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even if the pressure on expenditure caused by the age pension bill is relieved by the Government's scheme as the Treasury predicts, what will this mean for individual retirees? As superannuation goes up, entitlements to the age pension will go down. On the face of it, individual retirees will certainly not be better off, and given the broader economic consequences of the scheme, those on fixed incomes will be particularly vulnerable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CONCLUSION</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been argued above that the SGL legislation will jeopardise; (a) economic growth, (b) employment, (c) price stability, (d) national savings, (e) current living standards, and (f) future retirement incomes. Perhaps most importantly, it will reduce the capacity of Australian industry to compete internationally, adding as it does, to the inflexible nature of our labour market. Clearly, the proposed superannuation guarantee levy legislation is yet another threat to Australia's future economic prosperity. In itself, the proposed scheme exemplifies the inability of the Government to implement the structural reforms so desperately required if we are to achieve sustainable economic growth. Hamstrung by its relationship with the ACTU, the Government finds itself unable to take on the policy actions it knows are needed.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many issues were raised in the second reading debate. I thought the contributions from those honourable senators who were members of the Select Committee on Superannuation were very substantial. Quite clearly, I could not agree with all their contributions, but that is not the point. The point is that I thought each of them made substantial contributions and it was a debate of some substance. I thought it fell away a little at the end, but that is perhaps as might be expected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are dealing today with major and long term reform. Politicians as a professional group do not rate highly in public esteem. The opinion polls rank us very low. There are a variety of reasons for that, and it is to some extent an international trend, but I think one of the reasons is that it is all too common for people to perceive members of parliament as acting in a knee-jerk way in response to issues immediately before them&mdash;recent and very well publicised events in New South Wales would reinforce this view&mdash;and acting in a way that fails to distinguish between party interest and national interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have here a proposal that is not going to change Australia fundamentally today or on July 1, or even January 1 next year. In the next 30 to 40 years, the proposal will make a very major change to the culture of this country, a very major change to the economy of this country, and a very major change to our society. It will make a contribution in three or, if one wants to subdivide it, four important ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, it is going to make a substantial contribution to the necessary retirement incomes task that Australia will face going into the next century. There have been interesting discussions by some about whether it is correct that the dependency ratio will increase, which is a very interesting arithmetical exercise. What is clear is that the burden on future generations of taxpayers to meet even the existing levels of retirement incomes for the burgeoning number of retirees in relation to the body of taxpayers will be a very substantial burden that we will impose upon our children if we do not act now to do something about retirement incomes. So this is a major response to that problem. All the parties in the Parliament seek to make a major response to that problem. The Opposition has a different response, but it recognises the problem and advocates its course of action&mdash;a course of action which I think will not solve the problem, but at least it is a recognition of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This proposal will also make a fundamental change to our economy because of its contribution to national savings. People have indicated that, because the expectations data indicates that it will not be a one-for-one relationship, every extra dollar going into superannuation will not be a net extra dollar of savings; there will be no contribution to national savings. That is a very poor argument. It is true that one simply cannot say there will be X billion dollars of superannuation savings, therefore the national savings will go up by X billion dollars. It is quite clearly true that one cannot say that because there will be some impact on the other savings activities of citizens. It is not possible to prove how much, but it would be extraordinary if that were not so. But if only half the money that is put into superannuation is an increase in national savings, that will be a very fundamental change to the nature of our economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major and continuing problems in the Australian economy is the inadequacy of national savings. This proposal will give us the capacity to fund the investment which the economy of the next century will require without relying upon the savings of people overseas, without blowing out our overseas debt. If we do not enhance our national savings, we have two choices: less investment or more debt. There is no third route. So this is a very fundamental contribution to the future of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This measure also will enable the pension to be maintained and enhanced for those who have not had the opportunity to contribute to superannuation. That is the next important element. If we do not do something about retirement incomes, if we do not do something towards self-provision for retirement by those in the work force now, when those people who have not been able to make self-provision come to retire, the burden of taxes will either have to be enormous or the society will not be able to provide the level of retirement income support that Australians have come to expect. We wish to see that support not merely maintained but also enhanced, and this is a necessary step in that process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a fundamentally redistributive mechanism. That is the reason why, as a package, it is a very major reform. It will stand as one of the major reforms of the decade. Everyone says that it needs to be done. Senator Sherry outlined quite clearly why alternative approaches of voluntarism have never worked anywhere. This compulsory mechanism is necessary. Nobody is arguing that some such mechanism should not be introduced. We are confronting the perennial argument of employers and conservatives since Federation and before&mdash;but since Federation in the Australian nation&mdash;that now is not the right time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been involved in negotiating in one way or another for improvement of working conditions since 1968. I have never met a conservative politician or an employer who thought that any time since 1968 was the right time for any improvement of any condition of the workers I represented. I am happy to say they have not always prevailed in those debates, but that has always been their view and it remains their view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one thing that is consistent is that it is never the right time. In fact, there is a very straightforward economic argument that would contend that as one emerges from a recession there is no better time, but let us not worry about that. It is quite clear that these people would never ever agree to an increase and they will not now. It is simply an argument of convenience to say, `Now is not the right time'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that a large number of good corporate citizens are already paying extra superannuation.

But it is the oldest issue in the book that a large number of good corporate citizens are paying extra superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Watson and Senator Kernot raised questions to which I will respond fairly briefly. Senator Watson raised a concern about the funding of charities that might be affected by having to provide superannuation for their employees. There is a response to that in the paper released by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins). There was also a concern about whether ordinary time earnings included fringe benefits. The answer is no. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a concern about resident overseas executives. The Government will be acting to deal with that in the course of the debate. There was also some concern about people who have flat rate schemes. I will make a comment about that in response to a question that was also put to me by Senator Kernot. Other questions were raised by Senator Watson, but I think that answer goes to the heart of his problem. I do not want to take as much time as one normally would in responding to such a major debate because we do want to have some time for the committee stage later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One point is very important to emphasise. There has been accurate publicity about the amendments which the Government proposes to move. There is apprehension that one of those amendments may be misunderstood. It relates to the proposal to increase the minimum monthly threshold at which a payment obligation is activated for employees from $250 to $450. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fundamental to the Government's view of the way this scheme should work and its interrelationship with the existing award arrangements that the $450 threshold should not override existing award provisions nor be seen as a mandate to change existing award provisions. We do not wish to see people who are gaining a benefit at the moment lose; we are simply trying to put in place a scheme for all those who are not benefiting or not benefiting adequately. It is fundamental that that neither overrides awards nor is seen as a mandate to change awards. That would be entirely contrary to the Government's intention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the concern about flat rate payment schemes, several industries have concerns, particularly the transport industry, the textile, clothing and footwear industry and the coal industry. There is sympathy for the circumstance of those industries. There have been some proposals in circulation and discussion to meet those problems. As drafted, they fail to meet those problems. They would neither solve the problem of the industry nor provide an adequate basis for security of retirement income for those and other people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government intends to continue to work to find a form of words which will maintain the fundamental integrity of the scheme and meet the legitimate concerns of employers and employees in those three industries without in any way penalising people who are paying the amount of money required by the legislation but under a different formula. So the current formulae that are in circulation are not acceptable. However, it is a legitimate concern which we intend to address. </PARA>

If we are to be criticised about the timing, we should have done it 20 or 40 years ago.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to follow up a matter that I raised in a question to the Minister representing the Treasurer, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) on 4 May 1992. I drew to his and the Senate's attention the fact that the annual inflation rate had dropped to 1.7 per cent for the year to the end of the March quarter 1992, that the average weekly earnings increased by only 2 per cent in the year to the end of the December quarter 1991, and that interest rates on savings investment accounts had almost halved. I asked: will the Government introduce legislation to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act to calculate the increase in provisional taxpayers' income at a more just and realistic level than the current 10 per cent?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raised that matter because of the number of people who contacted me who now find that the 10 per cent rate is unreasonable, to put it mildly. A lot of people now have to pay provisional tax who have not had to do so previously and whose income has dropped dramatically in the last 12 months or so. I heard one radio interview in Canberra when a man rang in to say that when he had retired two years ago he had calculated that the income for him and his wife would be $18,000 a year. That, they had concluded, was a most adequate income and they were very happy with the arrangements. But he said that his income had now dropped&mdash;I do not remember the precise figure but it was around $9,000 and less than $10,000. He recognised that he was in a mess as a consequence of this. But he, of course, still had income from which tax had not been taken and he was required to pay provisional tax, which was still being levied at 10 per cent notwithstanding the drop in his income. Other people have made representations to me about this very matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Businesses pay provisional tax, and I can only conclude that the Government's attitude to this matter is that businesses have plenty of money and can pay. If there is an advantage to the Treasurer that is fine, and if small people are hurt in the process it is just too bad. The answer I received from the Minister representing the Treasurer, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button), which he tabled on 18 June, indicates that the Government has no intention of doing anything about this massive injustice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The answer itself is bizarre. In taking so many words to say so little, one can only conclude that the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) knows that he is wrong and is trying to cover it up. I also invite him to take a course in plain English. I shall not read all of the answer, but part of it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provisional tax uplift factor was set at the rate of 10 per cent to reflect broadly the expected long term growth in incomes subject to provisional tax.</PARA>
<PARA>I will pause there. I would have thought that the Treasurer was one person who ought to know exactly what long term growth in incomes was likely to occur. `Uplift' is a word with which I have been familiar for a long time, and I had a certain view as to what its meaning might be. But I had to make inquiries as to what it meant in this context. I asked whether there was any definition of it in taxation terms and I finally found that it is tax jargon which means `to increase'&mdash;in other words, to take more from taxpayers. The answer goes on to reflect on the fact that inflation and interest rates are components of provisional tax income, but they are not the only tax components. It does not bother to mention what the others are. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Incomes subject to provisional tax may be expected to exhibit quite a sharp proportional rise during the emergence from an economic downturn.</PARA>
<PARA>I am glad the Treasurer thinks there will be one. In the meantime, the people on the incomes which I am referring to are having a very hard time of it. The next paragraph of the answer really indicates the extent to which the Treasurer is out of touch with the impact of the Income Tax Assessment Act on these people. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If a taxpayer considers that the amount of provisional tax assessed in any year is more than his or her expected tax liability for the year, the taxpayer is able to vary the provisional tax liability to the amount of the expected lesser tax liability.</PARA>
<PARA>However, to do that he or she would have to go to a tax accountant. People then get into a situation of paying the fees involved in that. If honourable senators have seen the tax Act lately they would have some idea of why it is very costly to do so. The answer then states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This self-assessment option is available to those who believe their incomes for the year will not rise by 10 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>That means that one can make an assessment of what one thinks one's income will be. That may sound reasonable&mdash;one can work it out from last year's income and so on&mdash;but, if one makes a mistake and finishes up with more income than one has assessed, the penalties are horrendous. Who can risk doing this? Who can risk not paying the 10 per cent in light of the consequences that will be visited upon people by the Taxation Office and the Treasurer if that is in fact the outcome? We get this magic word again when it goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 10 per cent uplift factor was set in legislation with a view to making the provisional tax system&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Wait till you hear this, Mr Deputy President&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">more simple and certain by avoiding the need to adjust the rate annually.</PARA>
<PARA>The only person for whom it might have been more simple and certain is the Treasurer. It is certainly not the taxpayers that he is supposed to be looking after. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nevertheless, the Government is monitoring the experience with the current uplift factor&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>It is definitely hooked on it&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and would introduce amending legislation, if it believed that alteration of the uplift factor was warranted in future years.</PARA>
<PARA>That phrase appears four times in this. It has happened now: people's incomes have dropped dramatically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not the first person to raise this. Senator Watson has spoken on it several times. I am certain that the Treasurer's representative in this place understands exactly what we are talking about. If one were to go to an accountant to have it calculated in an attempt to reduce one's tax in that fashion, one would be paying as much as if one paid the 10 per cent in advance as provisional tax in any event. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, that is not the only way that the Treasurer will rip off taxpayers. I know of two incidences recently in which people are in credit with the Tax Office. When they have asked for a refund, the Treasurer has virtually laughed at them and said, `You will be owing us more sooner or later. We will keep it on account'. The Tax Office does not pay interest on it; it just keeps it on account. But if you, Mr Deputy President, happen to owe the Treasurer some money through tax and do not pay it on time, you are likely to be pursued and charged penalties on the money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the Treasurer again: why will he not adjust this 10 per cent? The only conclusion I can come to is that he does not care about those who are involved in having to find and pay this money and that he enjoys getting the extra money that he is not entitled to and that he will not adjust. It ought to be adjusted annually. To try to hide behind words suggesting it is more simple and certain is totally unacceptable. It is unconscionable that this should be allowed to go on. I conclude from the Treasurer's answer that he is quite happy, and in fact is determined, to allow it to continue because of the benefit he sees in the money that the Government gets in from this totally unworthy source. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 23 August 1978, I rose in this chamber to give my first speech. In the course of that contribution I said that one of the most disturbing features of our statute book with regard to the matter of conscientious objection and the waging of war was the failure of the National Service Act to protect the conscience formed by the rules of the just war. I went on to indicate how the Act had provided, of course, for the person who was a total pacifist, but did not provide for the ordinary person whose conscience allows him to distinguish between a just and an unjust war. There was no adequate provision for recognition of that conscience at all. I went on to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We as legislators ought to be reinforcing the individual conscience as that which culturally makes us what we are&mdash;a society where the common good cannot be secured by means which destroy the individual personality.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am very pleased of course that only today the Senate has passed a Bill which in fact deals with those very important and vital matters to our democracy which I mentioned in my first speech in this chamber 14 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those remarks of course came out of my experience during the time of the Vietnam war when I recall, having returned to lecture at the University of Tasmania, being at one of the university colleges one evening, sitting around a radiogram, listening to the marbles being drawn out of the barrel and seeing young students sitting around with great apprehension wondering whether a marble bearing the date of their birth would be drawn out and therefore they would be conscripted to serve in Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall very well the blood draining from the face of one young student when his marble was in fact drawn out. Of course he commented that whilst he would be prepared to defend Australia, he would certainly, in conscience, not feel able to participate in the Vietnam war conflict. In other words, he had a conscientious objection to a particular armed conflict to which he was being conscripted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only was his conscience not recognised but also, if he was going to go through any sort of process of protest, he was forced to go to the magistrates court and be involved in a very adversarial proceeding where he would be confronted with the claims of society being advanced by an aggressive lawyer on one side and his trying to explain his conscience to the magistrate on the other. So the whole forum in which his conscience was examined was also totally inappropriate to the fundamental integrity of his conscience, which he may not have been able to articulate in a way which was suitable to the normal processes of our common law adversarial system of arriving at the truth of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was very interesting that some seven years later I was able to chair a committee, the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, which prepared a unanimous report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Conscientious Objection to Conscripted Military Service</EMPHASIS>. The report was written by three members from this side of the chamber&mdash;myself as Chairman, Senator Nick Bolkus and Senator Barney Cooney&mdash;and three members from the other side: Senator Robert Hill, the late Senator Alan Missen and former Senator Chris Puplick. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was the unanimous recommendation of that particular Committee: recognising that conscientious objection to military service was such a fundamental matter to the integrity of a human being, the Parliament should change the National Service Act and the Defence Act to enable recognition of the conscientious objection to a particular war. As I said, that proposal was put by that Committee, to which was added provision for the better manner of assessment of whether that conscientious belief actually existed; the person making the claim that it did bearing the onus of proving that on the balance of probabilities. In answer to the inevitable objection that this might undermine our society, we stated in the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the relationship between the Government and the governed in Australia's democratic society requires and allows for the recognition of conscientious belief. In a democratic society, the bounds of tolerance of individual behaviour are not as tightly drawn as in an authoritarian, or totalitarian, society. Dissent from the government's decision or programs is not to be always described as `mere political dissidence.' Recognition that some dissent can be conscientiously based is a mark of a democratic society.</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Australia, as a democracy, even when engaged in armed conflict, is well able to accommodate the proposed extension of the recognition of conscientious belief in order to protect the integrity of the individual against the coercive power of the State.</PARA>
<PARA>A further seven years later and 14 years after giving my first speech in the Senate, the Senate has today passed amendments to the Defence Act which adopt the recommendations of that Committee as a benchmark against which will be measured this nation's dealing with those whom it decides should be conscripted to perform military service. Of course, the National Service Act itself will be repealed by this particular Bill. For all practical purposes it has been defunct since 1972, but this carries out the formal repeal of that measure which, as I say, governed the conscription of those who went overseas to serve in Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That leaves the Defence Act, which deals only with the defence of Australia in time of invasion, or threatened or imminent invasion&mdash;an apprehended attack by the enemy on Australia itself. In that situation one might very properly predict that there would be very few who would conscientiously object to engaging in that particular defence of the nation itself, but there may be some. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that situation, the setting of this benchmark is very valuable indeed because it indicates, as can only be done by parliaments such as this in a time of relative tranquility and away from the hysteria of actual warfare or preparation for war, that this Parliament has set down the principles which should govern the protection of the conscience of the individual against the coercive power of the state, even at a time when Australia might require conscription&mdash;and I am not against conscription itself at a time when society is threatened. Even in that state of affairs this individual conscience ought to be recognised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate Senator Robert Ray, the Minister for Defence, for shepherding this very important reform through the Parliament and for gaining support for it amongst members of the Cabinet. I believe it already had a large measure of support in the Caucus and in the Party as a whole. Indeed, the tenor of this Defence Legislation Amendment Bill is to be found in the Party platform as amended at the national conference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This recognition of the boundary beyond which all organised society cannot go, even in defence of the country and its values, is particularly important in our democracy. It would be paradoxical and very contradictory to the values we would be defending as a democracy in a war if we allowed the overruling of the individual's sense of integrity in relation to such an important core fundamental matter as to whether he or she might be forced to kill another human being in armed conflict. To allow the collectivity to suppress</PARA>
<PARA>the individual in such an important matter of conscience, I believe, would be a very great wrong indeed and, as I have said, completely contradictory to the values of a democratic society which professedly we would be trying to defend in the warfare being engaged in. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator Collins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The tree fern management plan submitted by Ausfern Pty Ltd provides for the retention of at least one mature stem every twenty metres as well as spore laden fronds on-site for the purpose of naturally resporing logged sites. Additionally, in accordance with the principles of the Forests Practices Code, Ausfern has undertaken not to harvest <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Dicksonia antarctic</EMPHASIS>a from stream side reserves, thus allowing corridors of native tree ferns along watercourses to be retained.  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Designated Authority recommended that the declaration of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">D. antarctica </EMPHASIS>as controlled specimens be subject to the initiation of research on the natural regeneration and ecology of tree ferns in plantation areas. This was seen as the most appropriate mechanism to gain further knowledge to ensure conservation of the species while permitting a degree of controlled export. In view of the apparent lack of long-term commitment by the landowners, APPM Forests-Burnie, to allow harvesting of tree ferns on their land, it was not seen as appropriate to request that Ausfern initiate a program of re-establishment of tube stock seedlings for the duration of the current licence which expires on 31 December 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Ausfern has provided some evidence of natural regeneration of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">D. antarctica</EMPHASIS> in a eucalypt plantation at Lockwood Creek and in a pine plantation on the St John's block north of Lockwood Creek and on block 127 Lapoinya, Land District of Wellington managed by the Tasmanian Forestry Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Little appears to be known, however, of the regrowth rate of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">D. antarctica</EMPHASIS>. The propagation and monitoring measures proposed by Ausfern which were a condition of the declaration of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">D. antarctica</EMPHASIS> as controlled specimens will be useful in allowing the gathering of relevant information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The view expressed in the monitoring report (which is included in the management plan) that planting of tube stock would allow faster establishment of tree ferns than resporing by mature trees left on site, was neither rejected nor accepted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Designated Authority was satisfied that Ausfern's decision to re-establish ferns on the logged areas through natural resporing was sufficient in the short term on an experimental basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Comparative costs of the different regeneration methods have not been established.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) A management program submitted by Australian Native Fern Products was approved on 22 March 1991 to allow the export of tree ferns taken from private land in Tasmania. At the time of approval, the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982 did not provide for the unilateral imposition of conditions such as the period of operation of management programs. Under these circumstances, it was necessary to ensure that re-establishment of seedlings would be undertaken on a long-term basis and proposed planting of tube stocks as suggested by Australian Native Fern Products was considered the most appropriate option.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) It is a matter for the industry to assess the most cost-effective methods of regenerating tree ferns and these may vary from site to site. However, in the longer term, it is anticipated that tree fern management in Tasmania will be conducted in a uniform manner throughout the State. In this regard preliminary discussions have been held with relevant Tasmanian authorities to facilitate the development of uniform regulatory standards for the industry and management of the resource on an ecologically sustainable basis.</PARA>
