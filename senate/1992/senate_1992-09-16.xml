<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first relates to the use of the terms `in-patient' and `patient'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government, in co-operation with the States, the medical profession and the private health insurance funds, has been encouraging a move toward day surgery and day only procedures consistent with modern medical practice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To facilitate this the relevant Acts were amended in 1989 to cover day surgery procedures. An integral component of those changes involved the substitution of the term `in-patient' in the National Health Act 1953 and the Health Insurance Act 1973 with the term `patient'. These changes removed the need to occupy a bed for private health insurance benefit purposes, thereby reducing the financial incentives for patients to be admitted overnight.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the reference to `in-patient' was substituted in the definition in the National Health Act it remains in the Health Insurance Act, the term `in-patient' still appears in error through the body of both Acts and this Bill deals with that oversight.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no policy implication of this tidying up except in one part of the National Health Act where the term `person' was inadvertently substituted in lieu of `patient'. Technically this inadvertent change would let private health funds refuse to pay benefits for new born babies in intensive care as they are technically not `patients' at the moment. The insurance funds understand, however, that this was an error and they are continuing to pay benefits while this change is being made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also contains minor amendments to substitute the title of `Managing Director' for `General Manager' of the Health Insurance Commission wherever the term is used in the Health Insurance Act 1973, the Health Insurance Amendment Act 1991 and the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The change of title is in line with the titles now used by other Government business enterprises. It is simply a change in title and it does not involve any change in the terms or conditions of the chief executive of the HIC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also deals with one aspect of pathology. In some cases specimens received at one laboratory will be referred to another laboratory, for example, where they require testing on equipment not available at the first laboratory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Act stands collection benefits are only payable where the specimen is collected by the pathologist or his or her employees. Where a specimen is sent to the second laboratory the collection benefit is not payable, as the staff employed by the first laboratory are not employees of the pathologist running the second laboratory. This Bill removes that anomaly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also contains provisions which will repeal those sections of the Health Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Act 1991 which related to the introduction of the interactive eligibility checking system and restricted the availability of pharmaceutical benefits to Australian residents and other eligible persons as defined in the Health Insurance Act 1973.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These provisions will not now come into effect because the conditions which had been inserted in the commencement provisions could not be met.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, on 1 July 1992, new arrangements for checking eligibility to free or concessional pharmaceutical benefits will be introduced. These new arrangements relate to tighter administration of the existing legislation whereby claims that include prescriptions where the entitlement to concessional benefits is not valid will be reduced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In these circumstances pharmacists will need to satisfy themselves that a person is entitled to concessional treatment. While the Government does not believe that there will be major difficulties in this, particularly as most pensioners, for example, are well known to their local pharmacist, there may be some cases where a person who is entitled to concessional treatment (ie currently paying up to $2.60 versus the up to $15.70 amount applying to general patients) has to pay the general patient rate at the time of dispensing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where such an event occurs and the patient can satisfy the HIC that he or she is entitled to the concessional rate there needs to be a power for the HIC to provide a refund. This Bill includes that power. This amendment will have effect from 1 July 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A further change removes a technical difficulty with the definition of `approved pharmacist'. While State and Territory laws now prevent a person who is not a pharmacist from owning a pharmacy, this was not always the case. A number of pharmacies which are owned by non-pharmacists are currently operating under `grandfather' clauses. In these cases it was the practice to approve a pharmacist manager `for and on behalf' of the non-pharmacist owner; however, in accordance with recent legal advice it is now proposed to deem non-pharmacist owners, where this complies with State laws, as pharmacists for the purpose of supplying pharmaceutical benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also makes provision to allow for the approval of suppliers to supply pharmaceutical benefits to be cancelled where it is clear that the supplier has ceased to supply pharmaceutical benefits, without having to wait for the approval to be inactive for six months before it can be cancelled. The other existing provisions which safeguard against inappropriate cancellation remain in place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill makes amendments to sections 4 and 5 of the Hearing Services Act 1991 that will further define `eligible persons'under the Act. The effect of these amendments will be that persons who are not Australian citizens nor Australian permanent residents will not be eligible for hearing services provided by the Commonwealth through the resources of Australian Hearing Services. The Minister may, however, determine (under paragraph 5(1)(h) of the Hearing Services Act) that certain persons who are neither Australian citizens nor Australian permanent residents can receive hearing services from the Australian Hearing Services Authority. The Bill also amends section 66 of the Hearing Services Act to extend the protection provided in that section to the statutory name `Australian Hearing Services'.</PARA>

<PARA>Mr President, I move this motion because in the community there is a great controversy about the role of New Zealand shearers in Australia. I must say at the outset that the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs is populated by senators who, while they may have a different agenda, have a clear intention when looking at any inquiries to find the truth and to make reports which are properly based and are useful to the Parliament and the people of this country. From that background I therefore give my support to this particular inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been allegations&mdash;and there continue to be allegations&mdash;that Australian workers in the shearing industry are severely disadvantaged by itinerant workers from New Zealand, who are able to take advantage of trans-Tasman travel arrangements and undercut existing working and award conditions. The result, they say, is that many locally based shearers who depend on local shearing contracts as their main source of income are now without work at a time when work opportunities in many industries are shrinking. This has caused a great deal of disruption and bad blood in many rural communities, even to the point of causing fights and brawls between Australian and New Zealand workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is some evidence of widespread disregard for award conditions by graziers and shearing contractors, who have little or no regard for local workers and who appear to have deliberately set out on a path of breaking down the hard-won conditions and wages of Australian shearers. On the other hand, the graziers in the community are saying that very unreasonable terms are contained in the award; they wish to have weekend shearing and a number of other measures that they believe are proper and reasonable. So we have this controversy between the two groups. That controversy should be addressed and the truth made public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All honourable senators present would be aware of the problems facing rural communities from the consequences of drought and recession in recent years. That makes the situation even worse. We have seen problems in the wool growing industry in recent years, especially with falling world commodity prices and diminishing world markets. These, combined with internal problems such as drought, have meant job losses in the wool industry. This has affected the shearing industry and the shearers themselves. It has exacerbated the problem in terms of the public debate and the effects that have been felt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that time both the Australian and the New Zealand economies have undergone substantial changes. New Zealand's new industrial relations laws and consumption tax laws are two key examples; they have created a very different climate from that which existed when the trans-Tasman travel arrangements and closer economic relations were signed. It is necessary for us to consider these important treaties again in the light of the way they affect job opportunities and conditions in Australian industries. Claims have been made that small businesses in the bush are failing because these workers quickly move on or return to New Zealand, taking much needed income out of the district. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The terms of reference were very carefully crafted to provide a focus, but at the same time giving an opportunity for those people who have shown interest to give evidence to the Committee and put forward a point of view upon which the Committee can make a recommendation to the Parliament. It is not in any way an exercise in Kiwi bashing, which people might believe is the case. Those people in the industry who are interested will have an opportunity to come before the Committee and give their point of view, whereupon an objective view will then be expressed by the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are people who believe that there will be a result that will show up one side or the other of the argument in a particularly good or bad light. They may very well get a shock. I know from personal discussions with people from the AWU that they are prepared to accept the findings of the Committee, spots, bumps and all. I ask people in the rural community and the wool growing industry to accept it in the same spirit. I ask people in the Opposition to consider the remarks I have made. I certainly want to see a result that will be beneficial generally to the Australian community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to the motion moved by Senator Burns, it is the view of the Opposition that it is an inappropriate time for this reference to the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs. Senator Burns has canvassed some of the issues. We could talk about drought and recession, of course, but it is not entirely relevant to the motion before the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real reason we feel it is inappropriate is that the Committee is busy at present. It has an inquiry into lot feeding in Australia before it. The Senate is sitting for just about the rest of this year. We look like sitting for about six weeks out of seven in November and December. There undoubtedly will be an election this year or early next year and, generally speaking, the time of those on the Committee is pretty well committed. To embark on an inquiry that cannot then be done properly and in depth or which is open ended seems very foolish and a waste of Senate resources. Certainly, the Committee's Opposition senators are on other committees as well and have very heavy commitments. Generally, we take the view that it is not the right time to be referring this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the risk of this inquiry being seen as an attack on New Zealand workers. There are a lot of New Zealanders in this country besides shearers and I think this reference raises a whole lot more than merely the question of shearers. In particular the motion refers to `the employment of visitors to Australia in the shearing industry'. The words `visitors to Australia' will undoubtedly cause other New Zealanders who are working here to feel that they are under threat as well by the terms of this inquiry, and that would be a pity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that this country has a close relationship with New Zealand, as it does. We have the closer economic relationship. The shearing issue is a part of that and I do not think it can be looked at in isolation. There was an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 14 September, entitled `Shearer survey fails to prove kiwi abuses'. There is quite a lot in this, but there is a great deal more in it than shearing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The workload of the Committee and of the senators involved is quite heavy. The Opposition's senators, Senator Brownhill, Senator Crane and Senator Calvert, certainly are on other committees which are busy. Senator Bell certainly gives the impression of being busy and I would have thought that the Labor senators&mdash;Senator Reynolds, Senator Sherry and Senator West&mdash;were all heavily committed. It just seems an inappropriate time to be giving a reference to the Committee and, for that reason, we will not be supporting the motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats strongly support the motion moved by Senator Burns, the Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs. The primary argument advanced on behalf of the Opposition relating to time has little substance in light of the impression conveyed by the Chairman of the Committee. The members of the Committee, too, have enthusiastically endorsed the terms of reference of this proposed inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought the Chairman's opinion would have been given a bit more respect. The Chairman, after all, is in a position to know about the progress of the existing inquiry into the feedlot industry, an inquiry which the Chairman has assiduously addressed the Committee towards. The Committee in fact has undertaken the majority of its visits in the information gathering part of the inquiry and the evidence has been acquired from the travel that was necessary. The remainder of the work to be done in that part of the inquiry is not quite so time consuming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee itself of course understands the urgency of this particular issue. It has been bubbling away, if not fully boiling away, for many months and I think it is an issue which does not respect, and should not be related to, any election timetable or any other matter. It is an issue in its own right and needs and deserves to be addressed in its own right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Chairman has summarised the allegations that have been made surrounding the whole issue of visiting shearers in Australia and Senator Reid quite rightly points out that this is an issue which has the potential of broadening considerably. In fact, the intention of the Committee is to allow it to be broadened so that it becomes a little more than a debate in which a few slogans are thrown about in the media, in which a couple of surveys are run by a newspaper and an attempt is made to enter the debate without a complete set of facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the debate comes before the Committee, the Committee has sufficient resources to deal with it, and the participants in the debate have the opportunity to broaden the issue and explain the full details without prejudice and without restraint. The fairest thing to do is to stop fiddling about with an article here and article there written by one or two journalists or one or two vested interests in the media. The Chairman's motion gives the opportunity for an inquiry to be conducted by the very committee which has the opportunity to put the matter in proper perspective and receive submissions from all interested parties. As the Chairman has already indicated, there is the potential for certain fixed positions to be challenged from one side or the other or from another side entirely. We support this opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The suggestion that the timing is not right is a pretty limp sort of suggestion, ill-informed about the progress of the Committee. The attempt to suggest that all the Committee members are busy is a bit of an insult to the diligence that has been displayed already by the members of the Committee. This Committee has been very productive, as one can see from the number of reports it has been capable of compiling, and very efficient in the use of the time available to it. I look forward to this Committee taking on this challenge. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the motion to refer the employment of visitors to Australia in the shearing industry to the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs. The case for the motion has been well put by the Chairman of that Committee, Senator Burns, and it has been supported by Senator Bell. There is widespread concern about this issue, not only in the industrial community but also in rural communities. What is needed is not the sort of confrontation pieces that we have seen&mdash;the polemics in the press about this. We want to see a thorough, considered examination of the issues involved. I certainly would like to see that and I think the proposal put forward by the Chairman of the Committee is a very good one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs is obviously the committee that should be dealing with this matter and it is quite able to deal with the matter. I cannot really see why&mdash;and I agree with Senator Bell on this point&mdash;the issue of the election should come into it. I respectfully disagree with Senator Reid on this point. Coincidentally, almost all of the members of that Committee are facing re-election in the coming election. None of the Opposition members of the Committee&mdash;Senator Brownhill, Senator Calvert and Senator Crane&mdash;is facing the forthcoming election.

The fact that people are working on a matter of considerable concern to the community should surely be a plus, if we are looking at things in political terms. But I think this transcends politics, and Senator Burns said of his Committee that the matter would transcend politics if it were given to the Committee. Under those circumstances and because I want to see this matter transcend politics, I would like to see the matter go to the Committee, as proposed by the Chairman.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;The opposition we have heard to this motion was very feeble indeed and not based on facts. When the Committee discussed its capacity to carry out this inquiry, there was no opposition to the proposition that we could do so. I recall that on the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare four of the current members of the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs were conducting four inquiries at the one time, and they finalised those four inquiries in a satisfactory fashion and very quickly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our Committee has set itself a timetable which we believe can be met. However, in the wisdom of the Senate, it may well be that it decides that there must be an extension. If that occurs and an election intervenes, so be it. It is an important matter and should be proceeded with fairly quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question was raised of only shearers being discussed. Of course there is not a problem only about the shearers. There have been small problems about workers from other countries for many years, but the shearers have been focused upon by the press and by the people it has interviewed and the observations they have made. It is a real issue; it is controversial. I do not see anybody going crook about Kiwi boilermakers or surveyors or engineers or nurses. So there is not a problem; why would we investigate it? Do not fix something that is not broken. The public debate makes this necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said at the beginning, and I know I have the support of everybody on the Committee, that this is not a Kiwi-bashing exercise. What does the word `Anzac' mean? There is a long and proud and friendly tradition of cooperation between our two countries and nothing is going to change that. But we do need to see what is happening in this industry and to get at the truth, so that everybody can understand it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the trans-Tasman arrangements or CER cannot stand up to some sort of examination, then they had better go.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>   REPORT OF THE SENATE SELECT    COMMITTEE ON SUBSCRIPTION TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">TABLING STATEMENT</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This report is the culmination of 10 weeks of intensive work by the Committee since 26 June. During this time, the Committee received 124 submissions and additional submissions, held 5 public hearings and, towards the end of the inquiry, held an extremely valuable "Round Table" meeting on technical matters with representatives of Government and industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pay TV is one of those issues that never fails to invoke a great deal of opposing emotions. For the past ten weeks, members of the Committee have been exposed to the full range of views on all aspects of Pay TV, and, I might add, in concentrated form.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, of those who put views to the Committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.some do not want Pay TV at all, others regard Pay TV as Australia's passport to the 21st century;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.some say that Pay TV is not viable unless it is delivered by satellite, others say that Pay TV is not viable because it is delivered by satellite; yet others say that Pay TV is not viable no matter how it is delivered;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the Committee was told by some that imposing Australian content requirement for programs or manufacturing would make Pay TV operators go broke; by others that unless an average of 70% Australian content requirement was imposed for programs and equipment, Australian industry would go broke.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And so it goes on.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From the outset, the Committee proceeded on the basis that this inquiry would not be "Pay Television re-visited," nor would the Committee set out to write the definitive report on Pay TV. In any case, the short time frame did not favour inquiries conducted on a grand scale.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Instead, the Committee sought hard to find common grounds on the remaining contentious issues on Pay TV so as to make the work of this Chamber easier when the legislation comes in here again.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These issues are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the conditions of participation in Pay TV by the ABC and SBS;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the length of the exclusivity period for the initial Pay TV licence; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.measures to optimise Australian programming content and manufacturing opportunities in Pay TV.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am hopeful that we have pointed out some options that may yet break the parliamentary logjam over the legislation. Among the key recommendations regarding each issue:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ABC/SBS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has recommended that licence allocation be based on channels rather than transponders, and, on that basis, the initial licensee should be given three channels and the ABC one channel free of tender or charge. We think the ABC should be allowed to do what it does particularly well&mdash;produce a news and current affairs service of high quality.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When digital compression makes extra channels available, the initial licensee would be given half of the additional channels and the remainder should be returned to the ABA for re-allocation in a public process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are confident that this process would be to the benefit of the Australian public. Among other things, the ABC should have complete ownership of its subsidiary and complete control of programming and would also be required to adhere to a rule of at least 33 percent Australian content.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian Manufacturing Content</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has sought to ensure that the Australian manufacturing industry will play a significant part in the Pay TV industry. To that end, it has recommended that 60% by added value of the transmission and reception equipment used in providing Pay TV be made in Australia, and that this content rule be monitored by the ABA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A particularly significant recommendation that will impact on manufacturing is Recommendation 22, which requires the Government by regulation to set a common standard for licensees using analogue technology in order to ensure that analogue equipment may be inexpensively adapted for digital use.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian Programming Content</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has made a number of recommendations to ensure that there is adequate Australian content in the programs shown over Pay TV channels. Among other things, the Committee has recommended that drama channels must ensure at least 15% of their expenditure be dedicated to new Australian program material; the definition of what is meant by "Australian drama" has been tightened up considerably; and the ABA is now also required to define what is meant by "new" Australian drama.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Exclusivity Period</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not surprisingly, the views of Committee members mirrored the wider debate in the Parliament and wider community, and common grounds did not come easily on some issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In particular, Members of the Committee could not reach agreement on one major issue, the period of exclusivity to be granted to the first licensee.

Their work, with the very tough deadline we had, was very much appreciated. We would not have got the report out in the time that the Senate gave us without the dedicated work of the staff.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tabling statement lists the fact that we received over 120 submissions and that we had hearings and so on. I want to comment very briefly on the difficulty the Committee had in dealing with many of the technical aspects of this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All members of the Committee started off with certain ideological prejudices or views about what we thought of pay TV and what sort of model should be introduced. Throughout the hearing, we all found that our ideological predispositions became quite irrelevant when trying to deal with the complexities of technology and where it was going. The way in which the hearings were conducted and the level of questioning indicated that all members of the Committee were very keen to try to learn and understand the technology of this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think Senator MacGibbon would mind my repeating his private remark that in all the years he has been in the Senate serving on many Senate select committees and standing committees he has never served on a committee that has had to deal with such detailed complex technical issues as this Select Committee on Subscription Television Broadcasting Services. I have not been here anywhere near as long as Senator MacGibbon. The only Committee I ever served on that came close in that respect was the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade when it dealt with nuclear ship visits, which became quite technical in one part. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real problem Committee members had to deal with was the conflicting principles of what one wanted in the model. We had to deal with three major principles: the issue of exclusivity to encourage commercial viability; competition to provide consumers with a choice and to hold down costs to consumers; and using this new form of media in Australia to maintain and enhance media diversity in Australia. One could certainly adopt a model that dealt with only one or two of those principles rather than all three. The Committee was trying to deal with balancing out those three conflicting principles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were subissues to be dealt with that very much reflected the three major principles: how much Australian program content should be set; how much industry participation should be set; what sort of technology should be used, which was the most difficult issue for us as lay people to handle; and, finally, the role of the ABC and the SBS, which is one of the major issues referred to the Select Committee from the full Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee's report is not unanimous. There are dissenting reports, though there is overwhelmingly a majority view on the major issues before us. Without trying to describe it in her words, I believe that Senator Vicki Bourne's dissent is at the margin of the fundamental issues. The Opposition senators, Senator MacGibbon and Senator Alston, have put in a substantial minority report dealing with the fundamental difference of approach over such issues as exclusivity and competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that, as many of us expected, irrespective of the report and our majority recommendations, the matter has to come back into the Senate. It will be resolved in the Senate by at least two of the three major parties in the Senate agreeing one way or the other to a position that perhaps the House of Representatives could agree to as well. I suspect that the tabling of this report today is not the final step. It is a major step forward and it will be a major basis for further discussion within the full Senate between the political parties and the Government to try to get a working model through the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be emphasised that all members of the Select Committee support the introduction of pay television; no-one on the Select Committee argues against its introduction. That is a major step forward in the public debate. I think that the process of the debate itself in the hearings of the Select Committee overwhelmingly proves that pay TV ought to be available for consumers in Australia. We are now one of the few&mdash;if not the only&mdash;major western advanced country that does not have pay television. It will be to our technological disadvantage in the long term not to start moving into pay TV. It is the beginning of providing a much wider range of personal communication, information and data information services to the public in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to conclude by thanking all the members of the Select Committee for the way they participated in the work of the Committee, particularly in the hearings, when we were dealing with very complex issues. Whatever the final outcome of pay TV in its final form, I believe the Select Committee has been a very useful public forum, not only for us, but also for the Australian public.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to join Senator Schacht in commending the work of the staff members who assisted in enabling the Committee to put down a report within an impossibly tight deadline, one that quite clearly was entirely politically motivated. It ought to be apparent that with issues of such complexity it is highly desirable that as much time as possible is allowed to explore them. I think that in the time available, the Committee did an excellent job in trying to come to terms with most of the issues, and the way in which the Committee was chaired was certainly conducive to that. I must say I was pleasantly surprised at the degree of harmony amongst Committee members when it came to a sensible examination of some very difficult issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose what ought to be apparent to any, even cursory, reader of this report&mdash;and in a sense it has been glossed over in the way in which the report has been crafted&mdash;is that what Mr Keating did a matter of months ago, in throwing a dead cat into the ring by proposing this 12-month exclusivity model, has been exposed in this report for what it is worth. In other words, it was never a sensible, logical means of enabling pay television to get off the ground. It was simply a political deal done; yet another example of the `media for mates' approach that the Government constantly adopts; and, I think, yet another graphic illustration of the moral and intellectual bankruptcy of those who are not interested in getting policy right, but simply obsessed with getting the politics right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at this report, it becomes blindingly obvious that virtually no-one supports a 12-month exclusivity period. A chart in the report shows that 13 of the 22 submissions which commented specifically on the exclusivity period argued for a longer period&mdash;from three to seven years. Indeed, that was Senator Schacht's starting position. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a nonsense to have this sort of hopeless political compromise of 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One may take the view that all the old hang-ups that people have about infant industries need to be constrained, protected and pursued and that, therefore, a sufficient period of time should be provided for the initial licensee to get well and truly off the ground. Senators Beahan and Faulkner, to their credit, took the view that at least three years was needed in order to have a sensible period of exclusivity. As I say, that was Senator Schacht's initial view. He has now come around in the report to adopting the 12-month period, presumably so that the Prime Minister does not appear utterly and completely isolated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact remains that overwhelmingly the weight of evidence rejected the logic and the economics of a 12 months proposal. If one looks at page 11 of the report one might be misled, because it says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the other end of the spectrum were those who advocated no exclusivity at all or expressed satisfaction with an exclusivity period of one year. The Committee noted the comments of Mr Stewart Fist, Hills Industries Limited, the Trade Practices Commission and Richard Rowe and Associates in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA>That is really verging on the dishonest. The facts are that Richard Rowe and the Trade Practices Commission both argued against any form of exclusivity. Hills Industries said one year, but Mr Fist said that there should not be any exclusivity period. He took the view that giving three transponders to the initial licensee was more than a sufficient free kick. That glosses over the fact that overwhelmingly the evidence rejected the notion of 12 months exclusivity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the dead cat Mr Keating threw into the ring on that notorious Sunday, when he humiliated the current Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) by rejecting his submission, which involved a five-year exclusivity period, and proposed this nonsensical political compromise, runs a very big risk of becoming a dead duck, and not just one we can treat with equanimity because it will be a side issue in politics. There is the very real risk that a monumental multimillion dollar disaster will befall the initial applicant. Many of the witnesses who appeared before the Committee made it very clear that the economics simply did not stack up and that the initial licensee was in very grave danger of either falling over or being fatally crippled by all the start-up costs and then finding that within a period of 12 months transponder licensees five and six would come along and swamp the initial licensee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It ought to be made perfectly clear that what is contained in this document is a nonsense on the primary issue, and the evidence overwhelming demonstrates that. I think it is regrettable that the Government would appear to be still locked into defending the indefensible. What I think will be clear is that, despite the Prime Minister's continuing personal vendetta against the ABC and his reported reluctance still to allow it to have any sort of free access to pay television, it is very likely that we will see yet another deal done with the Democrats so that the ABC will be given the role the coalition has argued for from the outset, that is, a channel of its own, free of charge; and, we would argue, one that does not mandate programming. Indeed, the report argues that it ought to be confined to news and current affairs and that the first licensee should not broadcast news and current affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report is silent as to what would happen for subsequent licensees, who presumably then could come in and compete against the ABC. We would probably find that the first licensee was still locked out. That seems to me to be a very unfair and one-sided approach to the game. Nonetheless, it is very likely that the Government will come around to the view that the ABC ought to be allowed to have that access, simply so that the Democrats can then be persuaded to come down to the one-year exclusivity period which Senator Powell and Senator Bourne both reject. I would have thought that if they had any regard for the evidence they would have to say as I have said&mdash;that there was virtually nothing in the evidence to justify a 12-months exclusivity period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There may be one or two of those who are prepared to bid for the first licence who would be prepared to wear it, but there can be little argument that they would be most unhappy and it certainly would not be their preference. An initial licensee would want as long a period of exclusivity as possible, for selfish reasons apart from viability reasons. Clearly, we can say that there is virtually no-one, apart from the Prime Minister and Senator Schacht, who appears to believe that 12 months exclusivity is desirable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what we have is in other respects a sensible recognition of realities, particularly the decision in relation to not mandating technology and transmission standards. That certainly was quite an achievement. There were those who urged us to start with digital and there were those who tried to persuade us that one form of analog was preferable to another, that the MPEG 2 standard for digital would be along shortly and, therefore, we could safely wait until then or require all licensees to start up on digital. But ultimately the Committee came to a very sensible judgment in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I strongly support from the outset the proposition that it is not up to the Government or, indeed, the Committee to try to outguess the experts on technology. The best way of judging that is to leave it to the players themselves. I should just say in passing that the principles to which Senator Schacht referred, which he has set out on page 6, do not adequately reflect the principles that one ought to bring into account. For example, I do not believe there is any such fundamental principle as the need for a period of exclusivity in order to maximise viability. I would certainly argue that viability is a relevant factor but that it ought to be a matter for the players and the marketplace. Certainly there is no divine right to a period of exclusivity, any more than there ought to be a divine right to tariff protection. Therefore, I do not accept that as one of the three principles. The need to ensure adequate competition certainly is, and the Trade Practices Commission will have a vital role to play in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need to ensure diversity will be largely a matter for consumers, and I think it will evolve over time without any direct intervention. Certainly viability ought to be a matter for commercial judgment rather than for government intervention. Therefore, paragraph 2.7 should not be read as any sort of positive argument for the proposition that we need to have exclusivity and that if we do not it is not in the best interests of Australia. There is certainly a need for regulation in a number of areas, but as little as possible ought to be the starting point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is certainly no need for exclusivity. We have argued from the outset that each of those initial six transponders, apart from one set aside for the ABC, leaving five, ought to be made available at the same time through a competitive tender process. That is a rational, sensible, commercial approach. The Government chooses not to take it for reasons that escape logic and commonsense, which would presumably have much more to do with getting the politics right and providing a free kick for one or other of those who might come into the business. Certainly it ought to be made plain that there was nothing in the evidence of any of the witnesses who appeared before the Committee or who provided written argumentation that would in any shape or form justify that decision. When it is taken in due course, as I have no doubt it will be, it ought to be exposed for the sham that it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of areas of agreement. The exercise was worthwhile. We remain divided on the fundamental concept and the model that has been put forward. We have rejected it from the outset. We have been confirmed in that view by the witnesses who have appeared before the Committee. Our position in relation to the ABC is one that the Government will grudgingly come around to, because it will provide a lever for it to persuade the Democrats to adopt what is clearly an indefensible position. From their point of view, I would have thought it ought to be quite unacceptable. As the high protectionists in Australia, they are the ones who ought to be arguing for as long a period of exclusivity as possible. If they do not, then I will be confirmed in my suspicions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is obvious from this report of the Select Committee on Subscription Television Broadcasting Services that this is a massively complex and technical issue. We did find it very difficult to get our minds around all the issues that we were asked to, but I think in the end we made a pretty good job of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is considerable disagreement among the experts on many areas in this report, especially technology. In particular, no-one has a crystal ball to foretell the speed with which inexpensive digital technology will become available. It is my personal view that we should start with digital technology if we are going to have pay TV at all, but it has been put to me by several people that if it is up to the key players, and if they are given about a two-year period to start up in, then we will start with digital technology anyway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats have put in a dissenting report, which is quite short. In that report we point out three areas that we think are particularly important. The first is local content. The report says that 10 per cent local content is inadequate, and we absolutely agree. Every submission which addressed local content said that 10 per cent was inadequate. The report recommends 15 per cent, which is better than 10 per cent, but I still think, and the Democrats still think, that 20 per cent would be better than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For reasons of viability perhaps it might be a bit difficult to go over 20 per cent to start with. It would not be difficult to start at 20 per cent. We think that in about five years the Australian Broadcasting Authority should have a look at whether that should go up to 25 per cent. Indeed, I believe that if we have an independent and viable industry, we can go up much higher than 25 per cent.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had evidence that many countries around the world have minimum local content levels that are much higher than that. So once we start encouraging the industry we should have a sliding scale of local content going up; but we should start with 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABC was addressed. We still believe that the ABC should be mandated with a channel. Representatives of the ABC said that they would like to start with a news and current affairs channel. Certainly they do that very well, and we believe that they should be entitled to have the exclusive Australian news and current affairs channel. It is nice to have Australian news and current affairs rather than overseas news and current affairs going out to Australians.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also believe that the ABC should be able to have other channels. It would be in the public interest for the ABC to be given other channels by the ABA, either free of charge or at a considerably lower rate, when those channels are allocated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last item mentioned in our dissenting report concerned exclusivity. I would like to recommend to Senator Alston that he actually read the report. He obviously has not read the two parts in the report where the Democrats say that they would like a longer exclusivity period, which has led to his offensive comments about the Democrats.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We said that we think a three-year period is a minimum and that we would like to see a five-year period. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we also put up another suggestion which was put to us and which we think is not a bad one. Rather than an exclusivity of total broadcast requirement, it would be an idea for the first licensee to be given programming exclusivity for either the movie or the sport channel, whichever it prefers, for a three-year period, and the ABC be given similar rights to the news and current affairs channel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That would allow all licences to be allocated at once. The start-up period could be a maximum of two years and we could have three years after that, with exclusivity on either the movie or the sports channel and on the news channel&mdash;so it would only be two channels. Concerns about open competition, variety and stability of service for consumers, and encouragement of the establishment of a viable industry would be addressed. Manufacturing industry and production industry could also be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two further things. I would like to see the local content go past the drama channel and include the news channel and the sports channel. I believe that one would have to put up a very good argument to have lower than 20 per cent, 15 per cent, 10 per cent&mdash;whatever we end up with&mdash;local content in any channel whatsoever, not just drama. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, and most importantly, I would like to congratulate the staff, along with Senator Alston and Senator Schacht, on their very good job. It was a very difficult and complicated area for the Committee, and it did an excellent job in a very short period of time under very difficult conditions. I would also like to congratulate the other members of the Committee. </PARA>

That was when one witness was asked questions continually, started answering with 19 sentences, and was allowed by that one member of the Committee to finish four.

But I think it is important that I say something on the report of the Select Committee on Subscription Television Broadcasting Services. From the day the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) expressed his view on how pay television should operate in this country, I said that the issue should go to a parliamentary committee for public scrutiny. Subsequently I served on that committee for a time&mdash;in fact, right up until it began its work on writing the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all, I want to thank the Committee for moving to allow me to continue to participate in the public hearings after I had been replaced as the Australian Democrat representative.

Yet, he is a signatory to a report that says no exclusivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sense of deja vu arises from another exercise in broadcasting legislation, either in 1988 or 1989, in which the Opposition did not support a Government move to expand television audience reach from 60 per cent to 75 per cent because its policy was 100 per cent. I always thought that 75 per cent was at least some way towards 100 per cent from 60 per cent. But on that occasion as well I failed to follow the logic of the Opposition's broadcasting policy. I fail to follow it on this occasion. Nevertheless, I guess we will participate in that debate when the legislation is dealt with in this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was pleased to hear Senator Schacht say that he believed this had been a positive exercise in a public discussion of a major issue&mdash;positive both in the context of the community, the interest groups and the industries concerned, and of the Senate Committee itself. That is quite contrary to the view he took late in the day when this Committee was being established. He had quite a different approach then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At least I acknowledge Senator Schacht's change of view which does, I think, prove that the Committee's deliberations had been positive. I do not know that we can say they have been productive until we see in particular what the Government comes up with by way of legislation and then what the Parliament does with that legislation. I hope it will be productive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been disappointed with what appears to be a continuing partisan approach, not in the investigations of the Committee but certainly in the eventual report. I hope that all members of the House of Representatives and the Senate, and in particular members of Cabinet and, I would suggest, members of the bureaucracy who are assisting the Government in putting together part 7, read the deliberations of the Committee, read the evidence and look at the compelling arguments that have been put for a model&mdash;a model different from that which the Government originally put forward at the behest of the Prime Minister. </PARA>

The fourth paragraph of the article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And one Labor committee member, Senator John Faulkner, is understood to differ with his two Labor colleagues, Senator Schacht and Senator Beahan, believing that the exclusivity period should be longer and that digital technology should be mandated.</PARA>
<PARA>In relation to the first point, the length of the exclusivity period, I think it is answered by paragraph 5.14 of the report. I quote the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The members of the Committee were divided in their conclusions on the need for a period of exclusivity, and on its duration. Senators Alston and MacGibbon were opposed to any period of exclusivity. Senator Schacht favoured a period of one year from the date of first transmission of programs. Senators Beahan and Faulkner concluded that three years was appropriate, and Senator Bourne argued for a period of three to five years.</PARA>
<PARA>In relation to the second issue raised in the article and attributed to myself, the question of digital technology being mandated, in private meetings of the Committee I did express my hope that the technology that would be used for the commencement of subscription television services would be digital technology. The Committee received conflicting evidence on when the first operator will be able to commence operation and whether that time frame will allow the first operator to commence operation with digital technology.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill proposes amendments to a number of Acts dealing with Commonwealth criminal law. These amendments will enhance the effectiveness of legislation central to the fight against organised crime and serious fraud:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">amendments to the Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988 revise the account-opening provisions of that Act to reduce costs and minimise anti-competitive aspects of the verification procedures. They implement recommendations made by bankers and other members of the Ministerial Advisory Committee on the Operation of the CTR Act for streamlined procedures for account verification. In addition, the amendments give effect to community requests for a broader range of verification procedures and facilitate suspect transaction reporting under State and Territory law.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">amendments to the Proceeds of Crime Act broaden the application of the money-laundering offence to the proceeds of a wider range of foreign offences including the proceeds of arms trafficking or the ransom money from foreign kidnapping.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">an amendment to the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987 will enable Australia to accede to the Council of Europe Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds from Crime thereby broadening the network of assistance available in such matters.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Crimes Act 1914 is to be amended to create a new offence of piracy based on the 1958 Geneva Convention on the High Seas and also to implement a number of recommendations by the Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law of which the most significant is the introduction of a system of penalty units for offences against Commonwealth laws.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">there are also a number of minor amendments to other Acts such as the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983, the Australian Federal Police Act and various confiscation laws.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Turning to the detail of some of the more significant provisions of the Bill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CASH TRANSACTION REPORTS ACT 1988</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are a number of technical amendments to the Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988. Some of these amendments have been recommended to the Attorney-General by the Ministerial Advisory Group on the Operation of the CTR Act which was established to provide a formal forum in which cash dealers could bring directly to the Attorney-General's attention any concerns or suggested improvements to the Act. That committee recommended a number of changes to the account verification scheme to make it more flexible and less onerous without detracting from the law enforcement benefits of the scheme. These amendments are contained in the Bill and I thank the cash dealers for their thorough examination of these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other amendments are proposed in response to the needs of certain groups in the community who need to open accounts in a name other than that by which they have been commonly known. Such groups are victims of violence or threatened violence and their dependants, women who change their name following marriage or the breakdown of a relationship and Aborigines or Torres Strait Islanders who wish to use a traditional name. A referee procedure will enable these groups to become signatories to accounts without the need to meet the usual requirements in relation to documentation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Suspect transaction reporting has been in place at the Commonwealth level for 2 1/2 years. State and Territory Governments have now recognised its benefits and are enacting complementary legislation to require reporting of transactions relating to State offences and to empower State police to follow up such reports. As these matters generally also involve tax evasion, they are already reported to the CTRA. Therefore, it has been agreed that the CTRA should be the recipient of reports under State law. Accordingly, the Bill will enable the CTRA to receive and deal with information reported under State legislation as if it were reported under the Commonwealth Act. The Victorian government has already introduced amendments to its Crimes (Confiscation of Profits) Act requiring the reporting of suspect transactions to the CTRA and other States and the Territories are expected to follow.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The success of Australia's cash transaction initiative is rapidly gaining world-wide recognition. Earlier this year a team of examiners from the US, Japan and Sweden visited Australia to assess, at first hand, Australia's implementation of the 40 anti-money laundering initiatives developed by the G7 Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in 1990. We can all take considerable pride in the fact that this team of experts formed the view that Australia had already implemented 39 of those 40 recommendations and will have achieved full implementation on ratifying the Vienna Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, which I expect will occur later this year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This achievement is drawing experts from throughout the world to inspect the systems used by the CTRA and to examine closely the legislation which supports it. Scrutiny will be at its most intense under Australia's Presidency of that Task Force during 1992-93. The Task Force met in Sydney in early September&mdash;only the second time that the group has met outside Europe.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Just as the CTRA is under close international scrutiny, our own formal review of the operation of the Cash Transaction Reports Act which is due to be completed by mid 1993, will commence. The FATF examiners commented "Australia benefits from having a well thought out system, which is reviewed as energetically as it is implemented." and also "The high degree of acceptance of this system, by both the banking and enforcement communities, and the high level of cooperation and coordination which mark its operations, is in part a tribute to careful planning, but also to intensive consultation." The amendments now before the Parliament are a result of both these review and consultation processes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CRIMES (SUPERANNUATION BENEFITS) ACT 1989</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Act clarify the meaning of "sentence" in the Act and clarify the entitlement to employee contributions following the making of an order.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">PROCEEDS OF CRIME ACT 1987</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Proceeds of Crime Act will extend the ambit of the money-laundering offences in sections 81 and 82 in so far as they relate to foreign offences. Currently it is only an offence to launder the proceeds of a foreign drug offence. Proceeds of arms trafficking, kidnapping and other serious offences are not covered. In keeping with our international obligations and to provide greater protection to our own institutions against infiltration by foreign criminals, it is proposed to extend the money laundering offence to proceeds of all serious foreign offences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other amendments to the Proceeds of Crime Act facilitate the payment of pecuniary penalties from property restrained under the Act and enable the Commonwealth to protect and preserve forfeited property during the appeal period. Amendments are proposed to similar provisions in other confiscation legislation.  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CRIMES ACT 1914</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main amendments to the Crimes Act 1914 implement recommendations of the Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law chaired by Sir Harry Gibbs, GCMG, AC, KBE for the introduction of a penalty units scheme into Commonwealth legislation. The scheme will facilitate the calculation and updating of monetary penalties for Commonwealth offences and is modelled on similar schemes which have been operating in some States for a number of years. In future, provisions creating offences will prescribe the maximum number of penalty units and the Crimes Act will prescribe the value of a penalty unit. Thus, by simple amendment of one provision, the Parliament can ensure that the penalties for all Commonwealth offences reflect current monetary values. That will not preclude Parliament from using legislation to reflect the seriousness with which any particular offence is viewed by the Parliament by altering the number of penalty units prescribed for a particular offence. It has been recommended that the value of a penalty unit be set initially at $100. Further amendments to the Crimes Act will clarify the time limitation period for the commencement of prosecutions against corporations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another recommendation of the Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law relates to the restriction on the availability of imprisonment where an offence involves only small amounts of money. This recommendation is based on the view that the criteria is simplistic and does not take account of the fact that, in offences such as bribery, it is not the amount offered as the bribe which determines the seriousness of the offence but rather the nature of the office sought to be corrupted. Therefore, the restriction on the use of imprisonment should apply only to specified offences. The Bill implements this recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part IV of the Bill creates a modern offence of piracy based on the 1958 Geneva Convention on the High Seas. It is also closely based on customary international law which is reflected in the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The amendment implements the relevant recommendations of the Australian Law Reform Commission report No 48 on Criminal Admiralty Jurisdiction and Prize. At present, the law relating to piracy is governed by Imperial Acts together with various State and Territory provisions. The report identified serious problems with this system. The imperial legislation is outdated, its application in Australia is uncertain, and jurisdiction over the forfeiture of ships and goods is vested in Australian Admiralty courts which no longer exist. In addition, the validity and scope of the various State and Territory provisions is doubtful. The international rules about apprehension of pirate vessels are an exception to the rule that foreign ships may not be apprehended on the high seas or while in innocent passage through the territorial sea. Therefore, these provisions define `act of piracy' for this purpose in the terms accepted by the international community in the 1958 Convention on the High Seas. The definition is intended to embrace only conduct to be regarded as piracy for the purpose of the Convention, and does not extend to conduct that, while it might involve some interference with shipping, is no more than a simple expression of protest eg by a public interest environmental group. However, it is important to note that such conduct, while not `piracy' in the international law sense, might still involve an offence against Australian law, for example under the Crimes at Sea Act 1979, provided there is a relevant connection with Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed new provision will make the Australian law in relation to the offence of piracy clear and concise, and will restore jurisdiction over seizures and forfeiture to the Australian Courts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">MUTUAL ASSISTANCE IN CRIMINAL MATTERS ACT 1987</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is likely to accede to the Council of Europe Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds from Crime. Australia is entitled to become a party because of its involvement in the drafting of the Convention. The Convention does not require documents transmitted between States party to the Convention to be authenticated. The amendment proposed to the authentication provision of the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987 will enable Australia to comply with the Convention in this respect by rendering documents received in Australia pursuant to the Convention admissible in evidence in court proceedings relating to the tracing, freezing and confiscation of the proceeds of crime.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE ACT 1979</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most significant amendment to the Australian Federal Police Act will be to enable a female member or staff member of the AFP to be promoted during a period of maternity leave. S.34A of the Act, by suspending a member's or staff member's fixed term appointment during maternity leave, ensures that she does not lose part of her maternity leave entitlement because her appointment terminates during the leave. The proposed amendment to the section will remove the unintended discriminatory effect of preventing her promotion during that time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other amendments ensure that staff members are included in the scheme for the confiscation of superannuation rights and benefits of AFP members and staff members who have been found guilty of corruption offences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS ACT 1983</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Director of Public Prosecutions Act will empower the Director of Public Prosecutions to arrange representation by State and Territory counterparts in Commonwealth matters such as offences connected with community policing in the ACT, guilty pleas in remote areas, mentions and the like where the matter is more appropriately or readily dealt with by that agency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">FINANCIAL IMPACT</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments will have no financial impact on the Commonwealth but the changes to the account verification provisions of the Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988 may reduce the costs of compliance to cash dealers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In totality these relatively minor amendments not only strengthen the Commonwealth's criminal law regime but ensure that the Commonwealth maintains national and international cooperation in the fight against crime.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is now debating the Swimming Pools Tax Refund Bill 1992, a very serious matter because this Bill purports to retrospectively take away rights which have accrued following a High Court judgment. Furthermore, these rights have already been subject to challenge in the court. As late as last Thursday a judgment was given severely criticising the action of the Australian Taxation Office and this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only is this Bill unworkable but in its present form it will also not achieve its stated objective. It is reprehensible in that it contravenes accepted principles against retrospective legislation and constitutional principles concerning acquisition of property by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I submit that if this Bill is not amended in the way in which the Opposition puts forward, it will cause dissension within consumer groups because its effect will be one of inconsistent dealings. But it will have a wider impact in the long term which I do not think will enhance the status of the Government or the Taxation Office because this legislation and this taking away of rights&mdash;established under contract, legally binding, between ordinary citizens and the Tax Office&mdash;will not engender trust. In this particular instance pool builders will no longer trust the ATO, which has a history of agreements and ensuring negotiations, because the question in people's minds will always be: will the Tax Office challenge refunds or improper payments actually made or delay payments?  It has been put to me that counsel would be negligent in not advising clients when entering into such agreements with the Tax Office about a likely challenge or likely legislation to offset the effect of what would otherwise be a legally binding agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation was subject to quite extensive evaluation by the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. Although we are unhappy that inadequate time was allowed to fully examine all the aspects of the Bill and to enable negotiation and consultation to continue, this legislation has been rushed into this chamber today. As late as the other evening meaningful negotiations were taking place. I commend the Taxation Office and the Government for allowing that to take place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hence my surprise this morning to find that this Bill is being rushed through, which will prejudice those negotiations. I think that is unfortunate, because it could have been possible, with suitable amendment and goodwill on all sides. I submit that there was that goodwill. We have officers from the Taxation Office who are prepared to negotiate in a responsible and meaningful way within the limits of the powers that were given to them, and also other officers who were involved in court action and people who would be affected as a result of this litigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, one must ask the question: why the haste? Is the Government fearful of further critical comment from the Federal Court about its reprehensible action on this Bill? I leave listeners and readers of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> to make up their own minds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To put it into perspective, it is important perhaps that the coalition was somewhat unhappy following that evaluation. Senators Kemp and Campbell and I have brought down a minority report. That minority report clearly states that we believe that those who are entitled to the refund should get it. I do not want that important principle lost in the debate that is likely to follow. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly, those who ultimately paid the sales tax on inground swimming pools are entitled to a refund. This Bill fails to achieve that objective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's handling of this legislation has been deplorable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is to be condemned for:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)  its failure to allow adequate time for the Committee to fully examine the Bill in the light of expert advice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)  its failure to remove from the ambit of the Bill the refunds payable pursuant to the agreement between the Swimming Pool and Spa Owners Association and the Australian Taxation Office entered into in November 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)  otherwise, its failure to amend the Bill to facilitate a more effective system of refunds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The attitude of the Government in deliberately moving to legislate out of existence a formal agreement, voluntarily entered into by parties in good faith, will set a dangerous precedent that can only undermine public confidence in future agreements between taxpayers and the ATO.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indeed, it could be said that, to this extent, the legislation abrogates the rule of law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's approach is all the more reprehensible because it intends to continue to pursue this course of action in the face of a decision of the Federal Court (Queensland G89 &amp; 90 of 1992) which in recent days upheld the rights of members of SPASA to recover refunds under the agreement. Indeed, the court described as `unconscionable' the action of the ATO in denying to SPASA members their entitlement to refunds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The statement by the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>undoubtedly made under duress&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator McMullan, in evidence to the Committee that `the court has interpreted the agreement in an unacceptable way so we are legislating to overturn it.' amply demonstrates the Government's determination to legislate away the rights of citizens rather than to appeal the decision in the normal way.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the Government has foreshadowed amendments to improve the refund process, we do not believe they are adequate to meet the twin objectives of honouring the SPASA/ATO agreements and providing a refund mechanism equitable to both pool purchasers and pool builders.</PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, there must be a hidden agenda in this Bill. This is the most worrying problem in that the legislation demonstrates the Government's contempt of the High Court, and its willingness to dishonour an agreement made by an instrumentality&mdash;an agency&mdash;of government entered into in good faith, and members of an association, in this case the Swimming Pools and Spa Association of Australia. That agreement is threatened, which is a worry. The reason for the coalition amendment is to ensure that the Government does honour that commitment and, at the same time, that those who are entitled to the refund get it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Bill is passed without an amendment to remove the SPASA-ATO agreement, there will be serious commercial difficulties for government, as people will no longer be able to feel secure in entering into agreements with the Commonwealth. This is a major worry, particularly as it has retrospective effect. This is not the first time that this has happened. Honourable members and senators may be aware that in 1990 there was an excise case involving BHP, and its rights were retrospectively taken away. We believe that that set a dangerous precedent, and I submit that that precedent has been replicated here today in the legislation before us. While the Parliamentary Secretary said that the Government does not lightly override such agreements, that is not good enough. Retrospective taxation, retrospective overriding of agreements and overriding of High Court actions and Federal Court actions, I believe, are deplorable acts of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps I should outline the sequence of events which led to this situation. Wholesale sales tax was introduced on in-ground pools in 1986. This represented a new field of tax because, for the first time, the tax was not imposed on goods as compared with a tax which had for several years been imposed on fibreglass pool shells. A concrete pool constructed on site, according to the legislation of the time, was deemed to be goods. The High Court found that this was not correct. A complicated method of calculating the tax was established, which included construction materials and labour as well as profit and overheads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax was contested in the High Court where a ruling was handed down that the tax was unconstitutional for technical reasons. This judgment gave the moneys which had been collected under the tax an unclear status of `non-tax'. The Tax Commissioner could not rely on refunds under the sales tax legislation. The tax&mdash;we will call it a tax for want of a better word although it was unconstitutional and, therefore, not a tax&mdash;from the beginning was complicated and naturally very difficult to administer. This gave rise to a number of obscure situations for which, ultimately, customers, builders and manufacturers of fibreglass pools all effectively paid an indirect price or penalty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax had been levied with the intention of bringing concrete pools into line with fibreglass pools. However, there was an anomaly in that the price was levied on the total cost of the concrete pool but only on the shell of the fibreglass pool, which is only about half the cost of the completed project. The deeming provisions caused confusion and uncertainty with regard to the application of the tax. There were, of course, errors of understatement and overstatement and an increase in avoidance schemes. These schemes were complex and difficult for the Taxation Office to monitor and police, and we acknowledge that. The problems led to many efforts to sidestep what the industry and the public regarded as a grossly unfair and suspect levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the main ways in which payment of tax was avoided was the use of the exemption for the owner builder. As might be expected, during the period from 1986 the number of owner builders skyrocketed from an estimated 2 per cent to around 30 per cent in 1990 in New South Wales for pools which were approved by local councils. Of course in Queensland, particularly along the Gold Coast, there are a whole lot more and the percentage was a lot higher. There is no reason to suppose that the ratios would be different in other States. The industry as a whole was well aware that a number of builders were avoiding tax under bogus claims as owner builders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This particular scheme accounts for about one-third of the pools built. When an array of other schemes is taken into account, it becomes obvious that the figure could be estimated at half the total number of pools built. So we acknowledge there was a real problem. Such a situation is only ever harmful to aboveboard operators because these honest people have to compete with builders who are not paying tax. In order to do this they have to carry the cost of the tax themselves or carry other losses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the early period of the imposition of the tax there was a significant amount of activity and prosperity in the industry, and a number of legitimate pool builders were able to survive, but as the recession bit and the industry was squeezed it became more and more difficult. Many of the taxpaying operators became increasingly concerned by the failure of the non-specialists to pay tax and their consequent competitive edge, along with that from the fibreglass pool manufacturers. Naturally, complaints were lodged with the Taxation Office which was provided with an outline of the problem. However, the Commissioner proved unwilling or unable to act&mdash;and that is the problem. We have seen this so often.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was at this point that the Swimming Pools Association moved to engage the service of professional advisers in the tax field. Thus, negotiations began for the redistribution of the tax burden in the industry. These moves met with no success and led to the beginnings of the situation which resulted in the High Court challenge. SPASA members began to appreciate that there was a problem with the tax and commenced making payments into a trust fund rather than to the Australian Taxation Office, pending the outcome of the case. This would enable the Association to remit the tax if the case was not found in its favour or, alternatively, to have access to the funds if the ruling went its way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in 1990 the Tax Office insisted on the discontinuance of this arrangement and required the resumption of monthly payments, even in the face of legal challenge. This was, of course, the situation which produced the eventual agreement between SPASA's accountants and the Taxation Office in 1990. Under the agreement the pool builders would resume payments to the Tax Office, including moneys already held in trust, on the understanding that, if a legal challenge were upheld, the Tax Office would refund all the disputed refunds as well as interest at the same rate as applied to the overpaid tax. This was the condition on which the swimming pool builders were willing to continue to make payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this legally binding agreement the SPASA members were the taxpayers and there was never any provision or assumption that repayments should necessarily be made to somebody else, namely, the end point customer, and with that point I must say I have some little concern. I submit that, using the court actions, it would have been possible for SPASA to have applied to the court for that refund to flow through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was, from the beginning, the contention of the SPASA members that the money was not, nor ever had been, sales tax. The contention was ultimately upheld by the High Court. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that any restrictions on refunds of sales tax would not necessarily apply to refunds on concrete pools. So the agreement which was made to pay interest on top of the theoretical refunds supports the removal of the issue from statutory tax regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">SPASA members and their accountants had no reason to imagine that the Taxation Office would renege on the agreement, nor to suppose that the Government might come down with legislation which, effectively, makes retrospective the dissolution of the agreement. This, in fact, is what has happened. It is almost unprecedented in taxation history. That is why I refer to this legislation before us as being such an important piece of legislation. It will be seen by others as setting a precedent and this Parliament has put its stamp of approval on such legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a most unprecedented case which bears more similarity to totalitarian government operations than that expected in a Western democracy, we have a move whereby the Tax Office&mdash;and the Australian Government&mdash;has chosen to dishonour its own agreement and has chosen to thumb its nose at the High Court in the process. The High Court has ruled that the Commissioner must repay to Precision Pools the moneys it paid pursuant to the SPASA agreement, plus interest. The judge determined that the SPASA agreement was a sensible administrative arrangement for the Commissioner and that he had power to make it; that Precision Pools is entitled to be repaid and entitled to interest pursuant to the agreement with SPASA; and that the Commissioner has no plausible basis for not honouring the agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of the legislation will be to create a climate of uncertainty about, and mistrust of, both the Government and the Taxation office. Australian businesses will not know when agreements are likely to be overturned by outright refusal to honour them, and subsequent entrenchment of a turnaround in legislation in an attempt to legitimise these so-called dishonourable proceedings. We now have the very odd situation where the Commissioner, in the defence filed, sought to deny not only that he had an obligation to repay the money, but also that he ever had the authority to enter into the agreement which he entered into. That is appalling. This agreement was entered into in good faith by a section of the community. This good faith is now undermined, not only in the section of the community concerned but right across the board, throughout the corporate and private spheres of Australian commerce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The uncertainty resultant from the break of faith is because the intention of this Bill before us is to overturn the decision of the High Court, even though the case is not actually mentioned directly in the legislation. This is further borne out by the fact that the Government has agreed to move some good amendments. I commend the amendments that the Government suggested to us, although at the time of the Bill hearing, they were not all presented. They are certainly a move in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of the practical problems will be to leave the contributions in the hands of the Tax Office, as in many cases the pool builders will not be able to establish a claim under the terms of the Bill especially in the period which has been allocated. That this effect is anticipated by the Government is evidenced by the revenue impact statement. The revenue impact will be positive but will not be able to be determined. How can this be so if the only intention of the legislation is to secure refunds from the Australian Taxation Office to eligible people? Indeed, the beneficiary under this legislation will be the Government because it will be retaining moneys that it is not entitled to and which the High Court has said it had no legal entitlement to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pool owners will still not be able, in many cases, to establish that they have paid the tax. Builders and owners will not be able to establish what percentage of sales tax has been passed on to the customer, because in many cases we have passed the period for which people have to keep the relevant information, namely, the five-year period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As builders have to establish that they have repaid the tax to their customers before claiming the refund under the legislation, there is no incentive for them to make the claim. During the negotiations which followed the Committee hearings we were at pains&mdash;and the Taxation Office was trying to assist&mdash;to determine what was the acceptable administrative charge they should get to provide the incentive necessary for them to pass on the claims. Obviously, they would not do it for nothing, and they had to bear all the administrative costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government members in the House of Representatives have insisted that goodwill will provide the incentive. This is not entirely reasonable because the industry is not a social security dispensing organisation. How many people have two in-ground swimming pools? This goodwill factor is unlikely to be present because people are unlikely to ask a builder to build them a second pool. I think the goodwill factor has been overstated in the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The administrative costs of the process are a decided disincentive. There is no suggestion of any assistance to pay interest on the thousands of dollars that theoretically may have been borrowed by the builders to pay custom</PARA>
<PARA>ers under the original legislation. I submit that in the revised arrangement the Government has changed that, but to date we have still not got a satisfactory method of allocating moneys to the builders to ensure that they will administer those refunds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My time is running out, and there are a lot more issues to be dealt with which my colleague Senator Short and others will take up. The Liberal-National Party coalition believes that the appropriate course of action is that, firstly, for the period from 1986 to 1990, prior to the agreement, the refunds should flow via the builders to the pool owners or the purchasers, because they would be the people who ultimately paid the sales tax under the invoice. Secondly, for the period of the SPASAA agreement legally entered into, binding and upheld by the Federal Court, the contract should be honoured. It is then up to the Government to provide the machinery and the mechanisms to ensure that justice is dispensed in an equitable way under those arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a point of principle, the Liberal-National Party coalition's stand is right and will be upheld and acknowledged in a court of law and in subsequent history on the writing of tax legislation. It is the only honourable way to go. What is dishonourable is this Government's retrospective attempt to deny rights under an agreement that has been acknowledged and upheld by both the Federal Court and the High Court. This Government wants to prevent further litigation in the court, and I think this is reprehensible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government in the explanatory memorandum had the temerity to talk about preventing windfalls from blowing into the hands of construction companies&mdash;who, incidentally, it did not trust to direct a refund to where it legitimately came from. In the light of these proceedings, it is little wonder that the Tax Office and the Government presume that no-one is going to act honourably according to the law when they are deciding not to do so themselves. I submit that it is the Taxation Office to which the windfall will result, unless the amendments can quickly be seen to be working well, particularly in respect of companies that are no longer trading or where operators have died. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's amendments are an attempt to address this difficulty and are welcome by this side of the chamber. However, it seems unlikely that they will be sufficient at this stage to sort out the problems. Therefore we ask, Mr Parliamentary Secretary: why the rush to conclude this Bill at this time when we are moving very satisfactorily to wind our way out of a very serious situation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further problem is that all those operators who shunned or evaded making a payment which the Tax Office demanded will walk away without liability. That is reprehensible. Those who have done the honourable thing have had all the administrative nightmares of facing the Tax Office, a successful legal challenge, and so on. Mention was made of one builder who entered returns with the consent of the Tax Office but did not remit the funds. Now these funds cannot be collected from him. He is a real winner. Once again, the Government has taken on board a problem in respect of amending this legislation, but it remains to be seen whether these amendments will suffice. Naturally, we welcome the attempt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast to non-payers, for one reason or another, are the builders who pay the so-called tax and then have a court ruling that the money must be paid back. They are threatened by the legislation before us that there will be no practical way in which this situation can take place because money must be paid back to the customer. A satisfactory mechanism for an administrative charge, with or without charge, must be established sufficient to recompense the pool builders for the processes they will be obligated to go through as a result of this decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just to reiterate, and to make absolutely clear where the end point is, if a customer had a pool built on which no sales tax was paid, there will be no refund. However, where the tax was paid, even though the price may have been the same for the reason of absorption of competitiveness, there must be a refund paid to the customer when it was the builder who paid the so-called tax. There will be enormous problems, I submit, and I look forward to the contributions of my colleagues on this side of the chamber. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this debate to support very strongly the comments of my colleague Senate Watson. I must say that the Swimming Pools Tax Refund Amendment Bill sounds like a somewhat esoteric Bill; it does not sound like a Bill of the greatest moment. But when one looks at the principles involved in this Bill and at the facts and actions of the Government that underlie it, I doubt that we have seen a more important piece of legislation on tax matters and principles of taxation come into this Parliament for a long time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want today to go through the background of this matter and to bring attention to the state we have arrived at today with the introduction of this Bill. This Bill is about retrospectivity; it is about the Government and its Taxation Office breaking trust with the Australian public. It goes right to the heart of credibility in government. It targets people who acted legitimately&mdash;and I will come to that later on&mdash;and excludes those who acted illegitimately and were tax avoiders. Whichever way we look at this Bill and the background to it, the only conclusion we can reach is that it is a very serious situation. It is a bad Bill in terms of some of its central elements, and at the very least it has to be significantly amended. My colleague Senate Watson has outlined some of the amendments we feel are necessary, and I will come to those later on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The history of this matter is a very important story to tell. The background really goes back to 1986, when a wholesale sales tax was introduced on in-ground pools constructed on site. Most of those were concrete pools. That decision to impose sales tax on those pools constructed in situ represented a new field of sales tax because for the first time the tax was not imposed on goods, as compared to the tax that had existed for several years on the sale by the manufacturer of a fibreglass pool shell. A concrete pool constructed on site was deemed by the Tax Office to be goods for the purpose of tax, and a complicated method of calculating the tax was set out which included construction materials and labour as well as profit and overheads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In February 1992 the High Court ruled that this was not a legal tax and, for technical reasons, under the Constitution the provisions imposing the tax were of no effect. That was the ruling of the High Court. For the purposes of convenience, I will continue to refer to the charge as a tax but, technically, as a result of that High Court decision, it is not. Taxing concrete swimming pools is not a bad thing in principle; the coalition is not objecting to that. It is not a bad thing in itself, but this particular sales tax was bad because it was impossible to administer fairly and to enforce. The artificial deeming provisions caused a tremendous amount of confusion and uncertainty as to how to apply the tax. There was a great deal of error in understatement or overstatement of the tax payable and, as time went on, there was a vast amount of deliberate avoidance of tax. The Tax Office proved incapable of developing an effective system to supervise or enforce the tax and it lacked the resources to police the tax and its collection to any worthwhile extent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The swimming pool industry comprises a very large number of small contractors. There are a few medium sized businesses but, as I understand it, no large or public companies are involved in the construction of concrete pools. Fibreglass manufacture is carried out by a much smaller number of larger companies. Fibreglass and concrete pool suppliers compete in the same market for in-ground pools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax was set at 20 per cent on the manufactured cost of the fibreglass shell as against 20 per cent of the construction value of the in-ground concrete pool. So effectively this meant that, for a pool costing the same retail price to the customer, nearly twice as much tax was paid on a concrete pool as was paid on the fibreglass shell. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The years immediately following the introduction of this wholesale sales tax extension in 1986&mdash;that is, 1987, 1988 and 1989&mdash;were relatively prosperous years for the pool industry. The economy was showing good growth and a lot of money was available for consumer spending. This enabled the industry to maintain sales figures at reasonably good levels, despite the extra cost of the tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, gradually, dissatisfaction with the tax, the avoidance issues and the whole mess to which I have earlier referred became widespread throughout the reputable section of the industry. These builders, including most of the larger specialist contractors who were acting ethically by making an honest attempt to calculate tax supposedly payable and remitting it by monthly returns to the Taxation Office, became concerned and frustrated at non-payment by a large number of other mainly smaller and non-specialist pool contractors installing in-ground concrete pools and the competitive disadvantage imposed by the tax as against fibreglass pools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Taxation Office received a large number of complaints about the system and the avoidance involved. Information was supplied to the Taxation Office where it could be obtained, but almost always no tangible result was forthcoming as a result of those complaints. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One main avenue of avoidance was the artificial use of the exemption provided in the Act for an `owner builder'. Prior to 1986, figures supplied with regard to local government approvals of swimming pools showed that owner builders represented less than 2 per cent of total approved pools. The definition of an owner builder in the Act was very tight, so much so that no ordinary home owner could qualify. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, by 1990, the percentage of approved pools by so-called owner builders in New South Wales had risen from that less than 2 per cent figure prior to 1986 to over 30 per cent of all pools approved by councils throughout New South Wales. It was well known throughout the industry that many builders were not paying tax on the basis that their customers adopted a fictional owner builder status. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By 1990, therefore, avoidance of tax by this one method out of many accounted for about one third of all pools built. Other methods were also widespread. Although no accurate figures can be obtained, it is commonly believed throughout the industry that tax was not being paid on well over half the concrete in-ground pools built in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In those circumstances it is not surprising that the ethical tax paying builders sought relief. Most of them are members of the Swimming Pool and Spa Association of Australia&mdash;SPASAA. On behalf of these ethical tax-paying builders, SPASAA engaged professional advisers, being sales tax specialists with one of the large accounting firms. They made representations on behalf of SPASAA members to both the Taxation Office and Treasury officials for the removal or easing of the tax burden&mdash;or at least for equity and fairness to be introduced into the arrangement&mdash;but without success. Thus began the search for other answers to the problem, which resulted in the legal challenge to the constitutional validity of the tax law that was commenced by High Court proceedings in August 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In February 1992, the High Court delivered judgment on those proceedings. The High Court agreed with the SPASAA members' contention that the so-called tax on in-ground concrete pools constructed on site had never legally come into effect. When the proceedings were commenced, SPASAA members, recognising that they had a genuine ground for challenging the tax, stopped making monthly payments to the Taxation Office&mdash;that is, in August 1990&mdash;or they made such payments under protest on the grounds that the tax law was not constitutionally valid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After discussion with Taxation Office officials, SPASAA set up a trust fund into which members' payments were made rather than to the Tax Office itself. SPASAA undertook to hold the moneys in trust pending the outcome of the case. If the law was held to be valid, SPASAA agreed to forward the moneys on to the Taxation Office together with any interest accrued in the meantime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That arrangement stood for approximately three months. In November 1990&mdash;and this is still 15 months before the High Court's decision of February 1992&mdash;the Taxation Office advised that it could not agree to the trust arrangement continuing. Instead, the Tax Office required payments to be made by way of monthly returns, despite the legal challenge that was then in train. SPASAA members were unwilling to do this, but eventually an agreement was made between SPASAA's accountants and the Taxation Office in an exchange of letters in November 1990. That agreement stated plainly that the members would resume making payments to the Taxation Office of all moneys under dispute, including the moneys collected in the SPASAA trust account since 1990, on the basis that, if the constitutional challenge was upheld, the Taxation Office would refund all moneys so paid under protest, together with interest at the rate applicable to overpaid tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without the promises made in that letter from the Taxation Commissioner's office, no further moneys, as the Commissioner well knew, would have been paid by SPASAA members. In light of the ultimate court decision, no further moneys could have been collected from them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For many years in the sales tax law there has been a standard provision that wholesalers who pay tax can get a refund only if they satisfy the Commissioner that they have not passed the tax on to their customers or that, if they have passed it on, they have refunded it. No question of interest arises under this provision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agreement between the Commissioner and the advisers to SPASAA made by the exchange of letters in November 1990 made no reference to this provision or to any requirement that refunds to be made would go to any party other than the taxpayers&mdash;that is, the pool builders. It was known to the Commissioner that the SPASAA members contended that the money was not sales tax because of the invalid law&mdash;or what they considered at that time, and were challenging, to be invalid law, which ultimately proved to be the case&mdash;and any restrictions on refunds of sales tax would not apply as far as they were concerned. The agreement to pay interest on top of moneys refunded also takes it outside the statutory limitations on the refund of overpaid sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before making his reply to the SPASAA proposal, the Commissioner was asked to satisfy himself that he had authority to make the agreement. His letter in reply acknowledged that. When the judgment of the High Court was given in their favour in February 1992, the SPASAA members had no reason at all to doubt that the Commissioner would honour the agreement by refunding all moneys paid under protest since August 1990, plus interest, while leaving open the SPASAA members' right to claim a refund of earlier moneys paid for the supposed tax since it was introduced in 1986. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Commissioner did not respond to their request for repayment and they were forced to continue with the legal proceedings which, until very recently, were on foot in the Federal Court. I will come to that in a moment. In those proceedings, the SPASAA members asked the court for orders declaring that they were entitled to a refund of all moneys paid for the illegal tax, plus a refund of the moneys due under the special agreement, with interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commissioner filed a defence to these proceedings in which he denied that he was liable to repay the money to the taxpayer builders under the agreement, and even that he had authority to enter into the agreement. Another SPASAA member commenced a separate action on the agreement in the Federal Court in Queensland. The Commissioner has stated that he has no intention of honouring the agreement according to its terms. He submitted to the Federal Court in Brisbane that he was empowered to refund moneys only as though they were overpaid sales tax under the statutory limitations; that is, the builders would receive only moneys that they had refunded to customers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the Federal Court decision on the case which had been put in train in Queensland could be handed down, the Government introduced the Bill which is now the subject of this debate. This Bill was introduced into the House of Representatives on Budget night, 18 August. The Bill declares that the Commonwealth is not liable to pay moneys promised under any agreement and that refunds of tax will be made only under the statutory restrictions that I have already mentioned. If this Bill in its present form becomes law, each builder will have to convince the Commissioner upon declaration under oath, with severe penalties for misstatement, either that no part of the so-called sales tax was passed on to the customer or that any such amount passed on has been refunded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By bringing in this Bill, it is clear that the Australian Taxation Office believed it could not win the Queensland court case. It, instead, has resorted to legislation to defeat the rights which the pool builders otherwise have at law. That is retrospective legislation of a kind typical of a totalitarian state, not a democratic country such as Australia that prides itself on fairness and normal parliamentary democracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our democratic rule of law cannot operate if a government feels free to legislate to take away existing legal rights of citizens without compensation. That is the reason why this Bill we are debating today is of such great significance, not just to the principles of taxation law but to the whole basis of the functioning of a free and democratic society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's fears about the outcome of the case in the Federal Court in Queensland were well-founded. The decision of the Federal Court was handed down last Thursday. My colleague Senator Watson referred to the decision in his comments but, in a nutshell, the Court ruled with the pool builders against the Commissioner of Taxation. It is a very strong judgment on the part of the Federal Court. What I am about to quote may have already been quoted by Senator Watson. If so, it bears repeating. In that judgment, the judge making the order, Mr Justice Spender, said, amongst other things:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Commissioner were an ordinary citizen it would, in my view, be unconscionable for him now to decline to do which he promised to do in 1990.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Justice Spender went on to quote questions of unconscionableness, estoppel, breach of warranty of authority and the principles lying behind his judgment. They are very strong words indeed from the Federal Court of Australia about the Taxation Office, the upholder of our whole taxation system in Australia. Let me repeat. The judge said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Commissioner were an ordinary citizen&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>subject to the same processes of the law as anyone else, as the Commissioner must be in a society such as ours&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">it would, in my view, be unconscionable for him now to decline to do which he promised to do in 1990.</PARA>
<PARA>That is precisely what the Taxation Office has been doing. That is why this whole matter went to court. Through this Bill, the Government is attempting to undermine all those principles to which the Federal Court has drawn attention&mdash;conscionableness, integrity and trust&mdash;and to legislate its way out of the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as the principles involved, the practical problems in the situation are enormous. Concrete in-ground swimming pools are sold under lump sum contracts. The vast majority of these do not show any amount for sales tax being included in the price. Nevertheless, sales tax had to be counted as a cost by those ethical builders who were paying tax in the same way as for any other cost of manufacture. The problem particularly in the last three or four years&mdash;although it is inherent anyway&mdash;has been that substantial discounts then had to be given on normal retail prices to meet the competition coming unfairly from the large number of builders not paying tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pool industry has always been fiercely competitive. Customers commonly obtain three or four quotes from prospective builders. A situation frequently faced by the ethical sales tax paying builder was to present a quote to a customer at a retail price which included allowance for tax, but then to be met by a substantially lower quote from a non-taxpaying builder. The ethical builder was then in turn forced either to meet this quote or lose the job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that way, retail prices, and accordingly builders' margins, have fallen steadily over recent years. To some extent, of course, that may well be due to recessionary trends and the problems in the economy. We have the deepest recession for 60 years as a result of Prime Minister Keating having pulled the levers of economic policy in the most disastrous way for the past nine years. But, principally, the builders believe that it is due to tax avoidance and the necessary reductions that have been taken to meet that situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In such a situation, how can anyone determine how much sales tax has been passed on to a customer? I am advised that the average price to concrete an in-ground pool would carry approximately $1,200 to $1,500 in sales tax. It is not uncommon for builders to be forced into giving discounts on retail price of $2,000 to $3,000 to meet the unfair competition. A business must preserve its margins at a sufficient level to remain profitable and therefore to continue in existence. It is not commercially realistic to argue that a sizeable discount either equal to or greater than the sales tax must be regarded as coming off the builder's profit margin, rather than relating to not passing on the tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Minister, in his second reading speech on introducing this Bill to Parliament, indicated that the Government believes it is acting in the interests of consumers in this matter by ensuring that any refunds ultimately reach them, thereby avoiding an undesirable windfall on the part of the pool builders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I have been saying today has attempted to demonstrate how wrong is that analysis of the situation. In particular, it ignores several key points. It ignores the fact that, where a customer has a pool built on which no sales was paid in the first place, then no refund can be given. It ignores the fact that many builders who have not paid tax will now walk away scot-free with no liability at all. It ignores the fact that no incentive is given to any builder to apply for a refund because the total value of it goes to the customer. The Bill denies the benefit of an agreement made in good faith by taxpayers with the Commissioner under which they acted to their detriment in paying further moneys which the Commissioner could never otherwise have received.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely that must be repugnant on any principle of government. No taxpayer could ever deal with the Commissioner or accept his assurance on any matter if later it could be negated by legislation if the tax authorities happened to find that inconvenient to their own agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where does all this leave the pool customer? He has no identifiable right under the pool contract to any refund from the builder and it would be very difficult to establish what amount, if any, had been passed on by way of sales tax in most cases. He has no direct right of a refund from the Taxation Office. There is no ongoing goodwill between the builder and the customer in the normal case, as it is not a business in which there are too many repeat orders. Some builders may feel obliged towards customers on a personal basis, but most will have no reason to incur cost and spend time without reward solely for the benefit of an ex-customer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So when this issue is fully analysed, when the background to it is taken into account and when the Bill itself is looked at carefully, it can be seen that not only is the Bill an outrageous denial of the existing legal rights of a group of taxpayers but it is more than likely, by design or otherwise, to result in a windfall for the Taxation Office by enabling it to retain moneys which have never been legally taxed. That is odious both in principle and in practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So for these reasons the coalition has very grave problems with this Bill as drafted. We believe that some of those problems can be met, at least in part, by amendments to the Bill which Senator Watson has foreshadowed. Nevertheless, even with those amendments it will be very difficult for this Bill to be doctored in a way that would escape the criticisms of the nature that Senator Watson, Senator Kemp and Senator Campbell have outlined in the minority report on this matter produced by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration and tabled here today. Let me quote a couple of paragraphs of that report. The opening paragraph says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, those who ultimately paid the sales tax on in-ground swimming pools are entitled to a refund. This Bill fails to achieve that objective.</PARA>
<PARA>The minority report quite rightly says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's handling of this legislation has been deplorable and the Government is to be condemned over its whole handling of it and its failure to amend the Bill itself to facilitate a more effective system of refunds.</PARA>
<PARA>It makes the following vitally important point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The attitude of the Government in deliberately moving to legislate out of existence a formal agreement voluntarily entered into by parties in good faith will set a dangerous precedent that can only undermine public confidence in future agreements between taxpayers and the Australian Taxation Office. Indeed, it could be said that to this extent the legislation abrogates the rule of law.</PARA>
<PARA>They are very strong words indeed from senators who are not normally moved to talk in such harsh terms, but they are very important words. They are very well founded, given the Government's handling of this Bill. We have a problem here of retrospectivity, of the whole question of trust between government and the community in one of the most important areas of government administration, namely, tax administration. That always goes to the credibility of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are passing this Bill today, I understand, because the Government happens to want to get the Bill through. The Democrats have acceded to this, so there is no way we can stop that. There is no great urgency in this Bill other than that the Government wishes to try to avoid further court proceedings that will be damaging to it. That is not a sufficient and valid reason for the way this Bill is being rushed. I hope that we will be able to give it further consideration. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As one would conclude from what we have heard so far, this is one of the most difficult taxation problems to come before the Senate in  many years, certainly in the two years that I have been here. It is unlike any that we have looked at because we are not debating whether to put a tax on some item or on an activity; we are trying to deal with an extraordinary situation in an equitable way. That is the key to this: we are trying to find an equitable solution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The history of this Bill really needs to be told&mdash;how we got to this mess. In 1983 the Parliament imposed a 10 per cent tax on manufactured fibreglass swimming pools. The industry complained that this tax was giving a competitive advantage to the more luxurious concrete in-ground pools, which were still untaxed. In 1986 the Government proposed to increase the tax to 20 per cent for manufactured pools and at the same time to impose an equivalent tax on the shell of concrete pools which are manufactured on site. This tax extension was achieved by deeming that the concrete shell was a manufactured good. The tax was paid, however reluctantly, by the builders and passed on to the owners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in 1990 a legal opinion was obtained by some builders which questioned the constitutional validity of the tax on concrete shells. On the basis of this, the pool builders went to the Tax Office and said, `We do not have to pay this tax because it is not legally payable, and we are not going to pay this tax unless you agree in writing that the money will be refunded, plus interest, if our interpretation is correct'. As I understand it, the Tax Office agreed to this, and the legal challenge to the legislation, the Mutual Pools case, proceeded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In February of this year, the High Court ruled in favour of Mutual Pools' assertion that the tax was unconstitutional. It is important to recognise that it is not beyond the power of the Commonwealth to tax these items. The Court ruled that the method which the Parliament unanimously approved of&mdash;and that includes the Opposition&mdash;was contrary to section 55 of the Constitution. We all said that it was a principle we wanted to adopt. We thought it was okay to tax these swimming pools; we did it the wrong way. So if we were to do nothing, subject to some uncertain legal technicalities, the pool builders would be entitled to a refund from the Commonwealth of all the moneys wrongly paid as sales tax from 1986, plus interest. The exact figure can only be guessed at, but estimates settle on a figure of at least $40m. Many people are saying that this would deliver a massive windfall gain to the builders at the expense of the pool purchasers who had paid the tax. That is unacceptable, I think. So we need a refunds regime which will ensure that, as far as possible, the person who actually bore the tax obtains the refund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation does provide such a regime, although we think it is still in need of further modification because it does not stop a pool builder obtaining a refund but it does impose a condition on that refund. The condition is that the builder must make a legal declaration to the effect that he or she has, in fact, borne the tax. This has to be substantiated and, if records have been kept, it should be possible to do that. In such cases the pool builder will be entitled to a refund. In all other cases the refund will go to the pool owner, or be split in some manner between the builder and the owner-purchaser. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think any of us would dispute that, because of the way builders have determined the total price of the pool, there will be some difficulties in some cases in determining who bore the actual liability and, therefore, who should get the refund. But I do not think that that makes the principle of seeking to make the refund to the actual person who bore the tax any less correct. In the committee stage I will move an amendment which seeks to overcome what I think is still a flaw in the legislation. Put simply, the structure of the legislation as it stands at the moment does not grant any rights to the pool purchasers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has spoken against the Bill on the basis of its overriding of the agreement between the pool builders and the Taxation Office. The Democrats regard this, too, as a very serious matter. We have agonised over our position. There is no doubt that it is a very serious matter for the Parliament to extinguish people's rights by legislation. We have people who are pool builders and people who are pool purchasers. By virtue of the way wholesale sales tax is imposed, the pool purchasers cannot be represented in the agreement between the pool builders and the Tax Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The structure of this legislation will ensure that if pool builders did, in fact, bear the tax then they are entitled to a refund under this Bill. That point needs to be made very clearly&mdash;they are still entitled to a refund. So we think that is a just proposal, although we are aware of the precedent we are setting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we were to exempt the agreement moneys, which the Opposition proposed to do in the House of Representatives&mdash;estimated at about $9m&mdash;this would have the effect of denying the rightful refund to all of those owners who bore all or part of the tax. The Democrats think that this is a greater evil than overriding what we regard as a very bad contract.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, the Democrats do not do this lightly; we think this is an extraordinary circumstance. In recognition of the administrative effort and the cost of processing these matters we agree that the pool builders should be paid an administrative fee. As I understand it, this will be a flat rate. It will give pool builders an incentive to cooperate in assisting their customers to obtain a refund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, I wish to emphasise that, in reaching our position, we have had to deal with competing principles. The sanctity of contracts and the confidence of the professional community in its dealings with the Taxation Office is a major principle, but there is also the general principle of equity. The persons who paid the tax should be the ones who are entitled to the refunds. Parliament is sovereign and in this case I believe that we should exercise our sovereignty to ensure that a fair outcome is legislated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This legislation, the Swimming Pools Tax Refund Bill 1992, relates to a longstanding dispute between swimming pool builders and the Australian Taxation Office. The legislation, as it has been put forward in this Parliament, demonstrates both the incompetence of this Government and its predilection to ride roughshod over the rights of individuals. For that reason alone the legislation is unacceptable to the Opposition, but it is also unacceptable because of its retrospective effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To summarise this issue, pending a decision on a High Court challenge by the Swimming Pool and Spa Association on the constitutionality of sales tax on swimming pools constructed in situ, the Swimming Pool and Spa Association entered into an agreement with the Australian Taxation Office to continue to pay the 20 per cent sales tax which was being levied on these pools, on the basis that if the challenge was successful the sales tax would be refunded to the pool builders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsequent to the High Court deciding in February this year in favour of the Swimming Pool and Spa Association, the Taxation Office reneged on that agreement and proceedings by the Swimming Pool and Spa Association to enforce the agreement were then undertaken in the Federal Court. Of course, only recently we heard the result of that particular challenge, and I will refer to that in a few moments. There have also been test cases initiated by some Swimming Pool and Spa Association members to recover moneys paid to the Taxation Office by way of sales tax on pools prior to the agreement being entered into. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is estimated that in excess of 20,000 swimming pools have been constructed since the introduction of this tax in 1986. The Association claims its members are entitled to a refund of some $8m, plus $2m interest paid under the agreement with the Australian Taxation Office, which covered the period from mid-1990 until February 1992. The Association also claims that its members paid $20m to the Taxation Office in the period from 1986 until mid-1990&mdash;that is, the period before the agreement was entered into with the Commissioner&mdash;and, on top of that, millions of dollars were collected from non-Association members by way of sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation has two purposes: firstly, to nullify that agreement that was reached, quite legitimately, between the Swimming Pool and Spa Association and the Australian Taxation Office; and, secondly, to provide an appropriate refund to the pool owner where the owner has paid all or part of the sales tax, and for the refund to go to the builder in some other cases. But subject to the amendments that have been foreshadowed by the Government today, only the pool builder, in the initial legislation, could initiate that refund claim. That was certainly a very significant shortcoming in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the basis of legal advice that the Association took in relation to its High Court challenge, it believed that that challenge would be successful and, of course, that proved to be the case. Therefore, its members would have been due to receive a refund of moneys paid to the Taxation Office&mdash;the sales tax which was not passed on to customers during the agreement period.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we would be well aware, agreements between the Taxation Office and taxpayers to settle outstanding tax issues are a regular and well accepted part of our taxation system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The significant objection which the Opposition has to this legislation is that, as it nullifies the agreement between the Taxation Office and the Association, this would be the first time that the Australian Taxation Office has reneged on such an agreement. Never again will taxpayers have confidence in being able to reach an agreement with the Taxation Office if this legislation is passed, because they could never again have any confidence that at some future date the Taxation Office would not unilaterally, with the support of the Government by way of legislation, revoke such an agreement. That, of course, is a very serious shortcoming in tax administration and a major objection to this particular legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me go to the background of the legislation. In 1986 this Government enacted legislation seeking to impose sales tax on in-ground concrete swimming pools. At that time, the Swimming Pool and Spa Association made representations, not only to the Taxation Office but also to Treasury and the Government itself, that in practice this legislation would be unworkable and, in particular, that the effects of the legislation could easily be evaded by unscrupulous pool builders exploiting the exemption available for owner-builders. As the record shows, these concerns proved to be absolutely correct.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1991, after the introduction of this tax, the number of `owner-builders', so-called, in Australia increased from about 10 per cent to about 40 per cent of all swimming pool constructions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1990 the Association received legal advice that the legislation was constitutionally invalid. The Swimming Pool and Spa Association was advised that its members need no longer pay this sales tax on in-ground concrete pools. As a consequence, the Association mounted a constitutional challenge in the High Court, arguing that the legislation was invalid. As a result of that initiative, in November 1990 the Commissioner made an agreement with the Association and its members to refund to them all moneys paid as and for sales tax from that time if the legislation was found to be invalid by the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In April 1991 the Association made a formal submission to the Treasury and the Taxation Office. This submission explained in detail why the legislation was not working and put forward a very compelling case for the repeal of the provisions introduced in 1986. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have already indicated, in February 1992 the High Court held that the legislation was constitutionally invalid. But despite that finding by the High Court, the Tax Office has not honoured its agreement with the Association. This is despite having taken legal advice that it could act upon the agreement's principles. As a result of that, Association members initiated actions in the Federal Court of Australia to recover the moneys which are owed to them by the Tax Office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 10 September&mdash;only last week&mdash;Mr Justice Spender of the Federal Court determined that the Taxation Commissioner has a legal obligation to honour the agreement which had previously been entered into. In his judgment he described the agreement as `a sensible arrangement' and stated that if the Commissioner were an ordinary citizen it would be `unconscionable for him now to decline to do which he promised to do in 1990'. Yet that is exactly what the Government is seeking to do on behalf of the Taxation Office through this legislation which was introduced on Budget night. If passed by this Senate, this legislation will retrospectively remove the rights that Swimming Pool and Spa Association members have under their agreement with the Commissioner which has now been determined as valid by the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Agreement was reached with the Commissioner to ensure that his interests would be safeguarded if the High Court decided in his favour. The Taxation Office would, therefore, receive full payment of the tax due. The Association was concerned that if its members ceased to pay sales tax from 1990 when the agreement was reached and the matter was determined in the Commissioner's favour some members may be unable to fund the payments that would then be due. There was also concern about the question of penalties. That is why the agreement was reached between the two parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that stage the Association and the Commissioner agreed that all moneys payable as and for sales tax by Association members would from then on be paid into a joint Association and Australian Taxation Office trust account, pending the High Court decision. The Commissioner subsequently declined to become a signatory to that account and withdrew his support for that arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsequently another arrangement was reached between the Association and the Taxation Office whereby the pool builders would continue to lodge sales tax returns and pay sales tax to the Tax Office. Under that agreement, if the constitutional challenge was successful, the amounts paid under the agreement would be refunded to the pool builders unconditionally, together with interest, and letters were exchanged confirming that agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the decision of the High Court with regard to the constitutionality of this sales tax and despite the decision of the Federal Court with regard to the validity of the agreement, the Taxation Office refuses to make the refund which is due to pool owners. Instead, the Government has introduced the legislation which is now before us to overturn retrospectively that agreement and in fact extinguish the existing rights of pool builders. This Bill will destroy a very sensible agreement that was entered into in good faith by Association members. It cannot be said in defence of the legislation that it is at all concerned with the protection of consumer rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concern of the Government is that there may be windfall gains achieved by pool builders if this legislation is not passed. But what the legislation ignores is the fact that many pool builders did not pay this sales tax. As I have already mentioned, a number of them became so-called `owner-builders' and therefore avoided the tax. Others took the risk that the High Court challenge by the pool builders would succeed. Therefore they took, if you like, a gamble and did not pay the tax. Obviously, they can in no way obtain a refund, which would have to be passed on to the pool owners. So this legislation completely ignores this significant group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unscrupulous builders who either posed as owner-builders or simply evaded the tax at that time placed unfair competitive pressures on those builders who sought to comply with the law and paid money to the Taxation Office as it was due with regard to sales tax. The consequence of that was that legitimate pool builders had to reduce their prices in order to compete with those builders who were not paying the sales tax. So, in effect, many pool purchasers did not pay that sales tax. Even though the scrupulous pool builders passed on sales tax to the Taxation Office, this was not charged back to the purchaser of the pool&mdash;the people for whom they were building the pool&mdash;simply because of the competitive pressures that were initiated by those unscrupulous builders who were not paying the tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, it is utter nonsense to talk of windfall gains being obtained by builders in these circumstances. As a consequence, it is equally a nonsense to claim that this legislation seeks to retrieve from certain pool builders so-called windfall gains. The clear moral requirement on the Tax Office and this Government is for the original agreement with the Tax Office to be honoured, for those refunds to be made available to the pool builders and for them in turn to pass on to the pool owners such amounts of sales tax as have legitimately been charged back to those pool owners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be very serious and detrimental consequences if this legislation is passed. I have already indicated and argued in the body of this debate that it will first destroy a fair and sensible agreement reached between the Swimming Pool and Spa Association and the Taxation Office. Secondly, perhaps even more significantly, it would establish a very dangerous precedent with regard to using retrospective legislation to extinguish existing rights. Thirdly, it would have enormous implications for the way in which taxpayers will deal with the Taxation Office in future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said at the outset of my remarks, if this legislation is passed, no-one ever again will be able to deal with the Taxation Office with any confidence in terms of entering into an agreement, negotiating a settlement or participating in a tax amnesty with the Taxation Commissioner. Instead, many taxpayers will take unilateral unauthorised action which, for many reasons, will not be in the interests of other taxpayers, the Taxation Office or the Australian community in general. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation fails on many counts, and not just in relation to the direct interests of pool builders and pool owners. The shortcomings of this legislation have also been highlighted by members of the accounting profession in the evidence they gave on Monday to the inquiry into this Bill by the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, brief as it was. They raised a number of points of concern about the legislation. A major point was the one I have just made with regard to compromising the future administration of taxation law because of the lack of confidence this legislation engenders in any future agreements that might be made between taxpayers and the Taxation Office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other concerns include the attempt by the legislation to circumvent recovery proceedings that have been under way for some time, which have now been determined in favour of the taxpayers; the retrospectivity of the legislation, which I have already referred to; and the practical effect of this legislation, which is to validate what has already been determined by the High Court as a constitutionally invalid tax. One of the problems with the legislation is that there is no incentive for the pool builder to retrieve the tax that has been paid, even where it is due to him, because of costs that would be associated with obtaining that refund and the lack of any offsetting benefit to the pool builder for such costs imposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The accountancy profession has also raised the difficulty about the notion of passing on this benefit from the Taxation Office to the pool builder to the pool owner. As I have already mentioned, a number of pool builders during this period did not charge out their tax to their customers, because of the competitive pressures that were imposed upon them by unscrupulous pool builders who were not paying the tax. As the accountancy profession says, the issue of passing on becomes a lot more difficult in circumstances where a tax is simply part of the overhead structure of a business operation and is not specifically charged to a customer. That is the case in many instances with this particular sales tax. It was absorbed by the pool builder; it was not passed on to the customer or pool owner. So to require that a refund can be obtained only in circumstances where it is passed on to all pool owners is simply unsatisfactory tax administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue the accountancy profession raised was the size of the administrative task in ensuring that such refunds are passed on to the customer, the ultimate pool owner. It is not only the pool builders who have extreme concerns about this legislation, it is also the accountancy profession, because of the inadequacies it sees in it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, the attitude of the Government in deliberately moving to legislate out of existence a formal agreement voluntarily entered into by parties in good faith will set a dangerous precedent that can only undermine confidence in future agreements between taxpayers and the Australian Taxation Office and the Commissioner. In practice it abrogates the rule of law. The legislation is all the more reprehensible for the way in which the Government has introduced it. It overturns a decision already reached not only by the High Court but also by the Federal Court of Australia, firstly with regard to the constitutionality of the tax, and secondly with regard to attempts by pool builders to enforce their agreements with the Taxation Office, both of which found in favour of the pool builders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statement to the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration by Senator McMullan as Parliamentary Secretary that `the court has interpreted the agreement in an unacceptable way, so we are legislating to overturn it', clearly demonstrates this Government's intention to trample over the rights of citizens rather than to use normal due legal process to determine those rights. Above all, that highlights the deplorable way in which the Government has acted on this issue. It is totally unsatisfactory. The Opposition will not have a bar of it, and that is why we are seeking to amend the legislation. Those amendments warrant the support of this Senate, and I urge Senator Button, as the responsible Minister at the table, to accept the amendments. If those amendments are not accepted, this legislation should be thrown out lock, stock and barrel. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pending a decision on its High Court challenge to the constitutionality of sales tax on pools constructed in situ, the SPASA entered into an agreement with the Australian Taxation Office to continue to pay the 20 per cent sales tax on the basis that, if the challenge were successful, the sales tax would be refunded to its members, that is, the pool builders.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commissioner of Taxation holds himself above the rest of the community and exercises powers, as I have said before, that make grown men cringe. Yet here we have the Tax Office reneging on and repudiating a legitimate agreement entered into. Honourable senators should ask themselves: what was the motive? Why did the Tax Office renege on an agreement it had entered into? Why, when there was an attempted enforcement of that agreement, did the legislation come suddenly before this Parliament? A second statement Mr Boucher has made is that he exercises the tax office without political influence. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I find any proposition that our internal decision making is in any way politically slanted to be an unwarranted slur. It is offensive to me personally, and it is offensive to those of my officers. . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am afraid that Mr Boucher stands convicted. Here is the Government legislating to enforce the rejection of a legitimate contract by which he was found by a court of law to be bound. Why did Mr Boucher reject the agreement? That is a legitimate question to ask. One could speculate that the answer is that the government of the day said, `If you do, we will give you the legislation to back it up'. Operates with no political bias? I think not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition will be moving amendments in the committee stage of this Bill. Senator Short and Senator Chapman have very strongly outlined the inequities and injustices that have long been perpetrated by the initial rejection of the agreement, compounded by the introduction of this legislation. Ordinary Australians are once again put at a disadvantage, first by the Tax Office and secondly by the Government; or rather, was it always the other way round? The Tax Office, said Mr Boucher, is not politically slanted, and yet the government of the day is bringing in legislation to back up a most horrendous act of dishonouring a contract. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time this contract was entered into, there was very good and adequate legal advice that the action of claiming the tax in the first place was unconstitutional. The Tax Office was aware of and privy to that. One asks oneself: what was the quality of its legal advice? One asks oneself: what was the basis for the implementation of the tax in the first place? Which particular branch of the Tax Office decided that it could impose that tax? There are many questions that need to be answered about, firstly, the way in which it was imposed; secondly, the agreement negotiated; and thirdly, why it was rejected. What discussions took place and what assurances were given to the Tax Office prior to its reneging on the agreement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I said in the Senate yesterday, there is no basis for any criticism of Australia that has been made by the Solomon Islands, and we are certainly disappointed that it has been made. In that context, we also regret the apparent decision that has been made to refuse permission for HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bendigo </EMPHASIS>to visit. I should say that we do understand the very real and very acute sense of shock and consternation that is being felt in the Solomon Islands at the moment at the violation of its borders by elements of the Papua New Guinea defence forces. The outrage felt in the Solomon Islands is legitimate. It is a feeling we also share. We just do not feel that any of it ought to be directed at us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do categorically reject any suggestion or insinuation that Australia is in any way responsible for the deaths of Solomon Islands citizens. It is quite incorrect to claim that because we have a defence cooperation program with Papua New Guinea or because Papua New Guinea sources some of its military equipment from Australia we are in any way responsible for any renegade actions by elements of the PNGDF. Indeed, there has been, in any event, no indication that the reported raid on Kamaleai involved the use of helicopters or, for that matter, any other Australian supplied equipment, to the extent that that is relevant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government does deplore the loss of life in the Solomon Islands. We are very concerned about the stresses and the tensions these developments are imposing on relations between Papua New Guinea and the Solomons, which seem to be reflected in the statement from the Solomon Islands Government National Security Headquarters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should make the further point that we are certainly not siding with either party in the current border problems. We hope that solutions arise from early discussions between those directly involved and we encourage such discussions to occur as soon as possible. Papua New Guinea Foreign Minister John Kaputin's proposed visit shortly may provide an opportunity to begin the process of reconciliation. We hope that that consultation with PNG will provide a sound basis for the Solomons to once again recognise Australia's genuine commitment to a constructive bilateral relationship.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Is it the case that Australia has been asked to send troops to the Solomon Islands to protect the border?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no basis for the claims that Australia has been approached to send troops to the Solomon Islands border. That reference first appeared in a press release issued yesterday, 15 September, by the National Security Headquarters in Honiara. As I said yesterday, on a number of occasions the Australian Government has offered to provide appropriate assistance to the Solomon Islands to help manage its borders. Our current assistance is already substantial. Our defence assistance in total amounts to some $4.97m. We hold regular bilateral defence cooperation talks with the Solomons, most recently in May. In January this year, in response to a specific request, we provided five 5.3 metre fast patrol craft, specifically to enhance border control capabilities. That is in addition to the two full-size patrol boats which were previously given. We recently supplied the Solomon Islands police with replacement communications equipment which would be used, among other things, to support border surveillance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all of that, our offers of appropriate assistance have not extended to providing troops to patrol the border with Papua New Guinea, nor have we received, as I said, any request from the Solomons for such troops. We do consider it important for the two sides to agree on strategies for managing their common border and for such discussion to identify their needs. We would be willing to consider sympathetically providing appropriate assistance to meet these needs once they are identified and defined. While we do not want to impose any concepts of border management on the two countries, we could help with advisory assistance. We could provide the necessary communications equipment to facilitate better communication between the Solomon Islands coordination centre and the appropriate PNG authorities.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The announcement made by the Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, today bears on companies, government instrumentalities and exempt bodies of various kinds. Ultimately the burden, in so far as there is a burden, will be paid by high income earners who are the major recipients of fringe benefits taxes. This proposal by this Government again introduces additional fairness and equity into the taxation system. If we go back over the history of this Government, we did that with the introduction of the fringe benefits tax. The Opposition opposed it. We did that with the introduction of the assets test. The Opposition opposed it. In each case it said it was unfair and unreasonable. Subsequently, it decided that perhaps it was not so unfair after all; it was an appropriate matter in order to have a proper, fair and equitable tax system in this country.

If it imposes more costs on employers, and costs to an unacceptable level, fancy the imposition on ordinary Australian workers, many of whom, as the questioner pointed out, earn below average weekly earnings.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with the US announcement of the sale of 220,000 tonnes of white wheat under the EEP to Pakistan at an average bonus level of $32.56 per tonne is that, obviously, it involves a breach of the undertaking to fully respect the situation in those markets where the EC does not at the moment have a significant presence and to take into account the presence in that market of non-subsidising suppliers, including Australia. The explanation that has been given for that&mdash;namely, that the EC was, as it were, sniffing around with the intention of entering that market&mdash;is not an explanation that is acceptable to Australia. It is the very situation against which we are seeking to guard&mdash;namely, a situation of plunging into a market and having a price reduction effect by virtue of one's presence in the market with subsidised wheat in an environment where, in the present circumstances, there is no competitive pressure from the EC for such subsidisation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can say quite categorically that the Government is not going to introduce a consumption tax. One of the reasons why we are not is that it would have a profoundly negative effect on the Australian economy. For example, under the Opposition's proposed consumption tax package, if normal wage and salary earners refuse to accept full discounting of their wage increases for the effect of the GST on prices, there is likely to be a wages break-out. If higher prices are imposed on wage and salary earners, as the Opposition will through its consumption tax, they will seek to correct that position by negotiating for compensatory wage increases, and this will lead to a wages break-out. Why should workers not want to do that when a 15 per cent GST is imposed on them?</PARA></TALK.START>

Accordingly, there will inevitably be some delay between the decision of the DPP that a matter should be the subject of a prosecution and the issue of the relevant summons.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday Senator Alston asked me a question which I think, by agreement, was based on an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>. It was a question about a paper prepared by Dr Ann Harding of the Centre of Economic and Social Modelling. I undertook to seek some advice from the Treasurer. I have been advised that the results of this type of analysis should be treated with a great deal of caution. The newspaper report of Dr Harding's paper appeared to report only selectively on the results. Dr Harding's paper, properly analysed, shows in table 1 that households in the bottom 10 per cent of all households paid $6.90 a week in WST and $7 a week in excise. The amount of tax paid rises steadily as income increases, reaching $62 a week in wholesale sales tax and $47.20 a week in excise for the top 10 per cent of households.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I have just said has to be seen in conjunction with the rest of this answer. Wholesale sales tax paid increases faster than excise. As Dr Harding states, `WST is essentially proportional across much of the income range'. In fact, on Dr Harding's figures, the WST becomes slightly progressive when calculated as a proportion of expenditure rather than gross income. There is nothing new in the claim that the indirect tax system is regressive. The primary cause is the existence of excises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the claim that the fuel excise is a most regressive tax, the paper makes no claim about individual excises and, indeed, does not attempt to make any distinction between them. The progressivity or otherwise of any given tax is not at issue. The only thing that really matters is the progressivity of the tax and transfer system in its entirety.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is possible to design a system that compensates, for example, for the impact of the GST.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am about to get to what we would do. What happened a week ago when the United States announced an enormous extension of the EEP scheme by giving wheat subsidies to its rural producers? The Prime Minister of Australia, Mr Keating, was caught flatfooted. He did not know it was going to occur. There had been no diplomatic dialogue. Our mission in Washington did not know it was going to occur. The Prime Minister was told in the middle of the night at some dinner that it had already occurred. He had no idea. This was the level of the relationship with the United States that exists under the Government in these circumstances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did Dr Hewson do? As any sensible, rational and reasoned leader should do in this country, he wrote to Mr Bush setting out the concerns of the Australian people in this matter. He set out in a most reasoned letter their deep disturbance at what was occurring&mdash;in fact, their anger at what was occurring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The letter looked at the basis of the relationship and the importance of the traditional relationship in other areas such as defence and whatever; how the trading relationship had developed; how we had been disturbed in the past by the extension of the EEP scheme; and how we understood that the United States was trying to combat what was happening in Europe. But the letter brought to the attention of the President of the United States that whether it was his intention or not, the effect of this extension of the EEP scheme was to hurt fair traders such as those in Australia, those who are prepared to produce for the market on the basis of their cost of production, not on the basis of subsidies. Dr Hewson brought that to the attention of the President of the United States. He went on to suggest some positive alternatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans interjected, `What would you suggest'. The importance of Dr Hewson's letter is that it makes some positive suggestions. The alternative is that we get nothing from the Australian Government. What was the response of the Prime Minister to Dr Hewson's letter? It was to bucket him, to abuse him&mdash;to say that Dr Hewson is completely out of step and that he should not be doing these things. Not that the Prime Minister was picking up the ball and producing policy, entering into diplomatic dialogue. His only answer is the answer that he always gives, and that is simply to attack someone. In this instance it was to attack the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This letter sets out some actions that the Australian Government should be taking. First, it suggested that they ought to enter into a dialogue to try to minimise the EEP payments and to try to ensure that they do not cross the border into our traditional markets, as has happened in today's announcement of the extension of the sale of American subsidised wheat to Pakistan. This traditional market of Australia's, which I understand has been basically an uncorrupted market in the past, is now to be corrupted in this way. Dr Hewson said that there ought to be urgent dialogue with the United States to try to avoid that happening. Did Mr Keating respond to that? No, he did not. He just abused Dr Hewson and said that he did not know what he was doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, Dr Hewson suggested a process of looking at some offsets, at least in the short term. This might not help the wheat growers but it may help some other portion of the agricultural sector in Australia that is also being prejudiced by the extension of international subsidies by both the United States and Europe. What was the response of the Prime Minister to that constructive and positive suggestion? He bucketed Dr Hewson again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, he said that in the longer term Australia should be looking at a closer relationship with the United States, this major trading power that is now locking itself into the North American Free Trade Agreement; that Australia should, perhaps, in the longer term look to dialogue that would even lead&mdash;and I use the words that are in Dr Hewson's letter&mdash;`to eventual membership' by Australia of NAFTA. He spoke of, in the shorter term, `greater Australian involvement with, and eventual membership of, NAFTA'. Dr Hewson says that he has raised that with the Australian Government for it to consider and enter into dialogue. What was the response of Mr Keating? Again, it was to bucket Dr Hewson&mdash;nothing constructive, nothing positive; just an attack on the Opposition. This is always Mr Keating's answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what we are so frustrated about. That is what Australians have a right to be angry about. This Government ought to face up to its responsibilities. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government would not mind in the slightest the Senate taking note of the statement that I made today during Question Time if the object of that exercise was to express in an effective bipartisan way, as Senator Boswell indicated to me earlier that he wanted to take the opportunity to do, our common opposition to this very unhappy recent development in United States agricultural policy. It is entirely appropriate that the Parliament express a view on that. We would have been perfectly happy to allow time for Senator Hill, Senator Boswell or anyone else to move such a motion after the one minute that I understand it would have taken Senator McMullan to move the particular motion that procedurally he had established the grounds for earlier on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But be that as it may, let me say that we have no opposition to the matter being debated in a sensible way. But it has not been debated in a sensible way by Senator Hill. What he has demonstrated again is the utter inability of the Opposition to look at larger questions of national interest. Rather, he has adopted a narrow, vulgar, partisan political view of this. He seeks the opportunity at every available occasion to not make sensible points about the way in which we should sensibly be conducting our trade policy so as to maximise Australia's national interests. Rather, he has advanced less than sensible points about the kind of political posturing that the Opposition feels it needs to engage in on these occasions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point about Dr Hewson's contribution to this debate is that it was muddleheaded and wrongheaded. As I have said on previous occasions, it was quite immature in its perception of the real elements of the situation that could be affected by the Australian Government. We all know perfectly well that the basic problem with the distortion of agricultural markets world wide is the existence initially of the European Community's market subsidy policy, which has been followed in rapid order by the United States in an attempt, in terms of its original foundation at least, whatever its recent manifestation has been, to counter that EC proposal and to deal with it by a form of trade war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the basic problem that we are confronting and nothing that we do as a nation can address that basic problem other than to secure the remedy of that basic problem, which is effective multilateral trade liberalisation and effective trade disciplines through the GATT Round that is presently under way. Obviously, that is where we are devoting our primary focus in an attempt to resolve this question because we know perfectly well, as any sensible commentator knows, that it is only through that mechanism that the fundamental underlying problem of the EEP program will be able to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time we are trying very hard to minimise the adverse implications of that policy until such time as it is addressed in the international forum in which it needs to be addressed. We are addressing the issue in a systematic way with the President. We did that in January. We have done it in subsequent exchanges. We are doing it in the present agricultural talks. We will be doing it next week when Mr Kerin goes and talks to the senior Ministers concerned. We are endeavouring to mobilise in this respect the other wheat trading nations that are adversely affected by this exercise&mdash;our fellow senior members of the Cairns Group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are proceeding in a level-headed, sensible, diplomatic way to maximise the chances of the effect on our wheat sales being minimised. That policy has in fact really worked quite well, as I think Senator Boswell would acknowledge, over the last 12 months when we have had the spectre of EEP sales intruding into our traditional non-subsidised markets hanging over our head. But in practice those sales have been able to be effectively avoided by one means or another as a result of a fairly effective consultative process. We had hoped that that would continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The very unhappy results in Pakistan that were announced a day or so ago do rather demonstrate that, as I said in Question Time, the political imperative seems for the moment in United States political thinking to have outweighed the international obligation imperative. That is an unhappy development. We will take the matter up politically where it needs to be taken up next week when Mr Kerin goes to the United States and all the huffing and puffing in the world will not address that problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason Dr Hewson got a bucketing from Mr Keating and the rest of us last week was that he failed to acknowledge those realities about that particular dual-track approach to the resolution of this problem through the international mechanism and through sensible bilateral discussions. The basic strategy that Dr Hewson advanced to deal with this was the compensatory strategy&mdash;one which tries to leap in, embrace NAFTA, get access to US markets in beef, dairy and sugar, and thereby make up for what one loses on the wheat sales that continued to be subsidised. It was a loopy strategy, one that showed no signs of understanding the realities of the force and power of the lobby groups in the United States and no particular understanding of the way in which NAFTA had not helped Canada to deal with exactly similar problems; a strategy which failed completely to understand the adverse implications for Australian industry if it had been pursued. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

It had had two weeks to do something about it, to put a procedure in place to stop the US Government. Two weeks later&mdash;yesterday&mdash;we heard an announcement that the EEP-assisted sale to Pakistan would be 220,000 tonnes of wheat in a market that was rightfully our market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No white wheat was going into Pakistan; there was a very small proportion of red wheat going in from the EC. Mr Bush assured the farmers after his visit in June that he would continue to take into account Australia's interest as a non-subsidising exporter. He gave that response to the farmers and he also made it in a letter dated 4 September. Seven or eight days later we find that Mr Bush, the leader of the most powerful nation in the world, has gone back on his word. We have seen him do a complete about-face, and Australian farmers cannot understand it. To them a man's word is his bond. Deals are done on a handshake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian farmers cannot understand how the leader of a nation we have stood by so many times could just turn his back on them. They cannot understand why Australia offered Mr Bush the greatest honour given to any visiting head of state, one not given even to our own monarch&mdash;to address both Houses of Parliament. In that announcement he said that he was our friend and would never let us down or turn his back on us. He then went out yesterday and did that. No-one in the bush understands what it is all about. That is why we have to debate this very important issue. </PARA>

We are trying to do it in a matter of five minutes each. Australia had 16 per cent of the world market, which had increased to 19 per cent before EEP came in. Last year our wheat share was reduced to 13 per cent, and it is forecast to fall even further. In 1991 we produced 15 million tonnes of wheat, and production has decreased now to 9.4 million tonnes, although the drought has accounted for about 1.5 million tonnes.

If there is no such resolution, the process that currently exists will continue to be blatantly abused and misused even where we try to give an indication that, within reasonable bounds, leave will be given. There is no question of any approach from the Opposition of seeking to be cooperative about these matters.

As I understand the standard English definition in the dictionary, when we say that a different set of standards should apply to oneself than that which should apply to other people, that is called `hypocrisy'. That is exactly what we are seeing here today, and that is why this motion ought to be defeated. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JI4">Senator PANIZZA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The President will not be here; I stand corrected. The suspension of Standing Orders to have a full blown debate is an urgent matter. The wheat industry's present position is far more urgent than a lot of people in this chamber and many people elsewhere realise. President Bush made his initial announcement some two to two and a half weeks ago and the Australian wheat growers experienced an immediate reaction to it&mdash;but I do not think their immediate reaction was experienced in this place and it certainly did not sink into the world trade.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the first instance, the Chicago Board of Trades price of wheat went up $5 a tonne, which was a reaction to the better treatment that the American wheat growers may receive. So, initially, that went up $5 a tonne, and a lot of people were led into the false assumption that that rise was going to have no effect. We are now two weeks down the track and we see the Americans starting to make their contracts. The first contract which was hardly mentioned was the sale of 600,000 tonnes of wheat to Egypt with the new EEP scheme; that was just over a week ago. Then, that not having been enough, they came in with this latest one to Pakistan, one of the traditional markets for Australian products including wheat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the advantage in Australia of growing better quality wheat than the average wheat in America, and we have been able to hold our market share due to that fact. It seems to me that the thrust of the American system is to really bang that money in. Senator Evans himself said today that that subsidised sale to Pakistan was at $35 a tonne. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two years ago in Australia&mdash;and Senator Walsh would know this, as he is still a wheat grower&mdash;we had a disaster of the same proportion. Two years ago at this time of the year we were looking at something like $180-odd a tonne and then, when we had the Americans working, it dropped down to $115. That was a drop of about $65 a tonne overnight which sent Australian wheat farmers to the wall. It was so important that the Lawrence Government of Western Australia&mdash;and I do not give that Government much credence for anything, but I do for that&mdash;offered a guaranteed minimum price last year so that a crop would be planted. I do not know how that Government could have delivered that, but it did. This year the Federal Government, giving the wheat industry credence, put a planting subsidy in the One Nation package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is an important industry. The Federal Government has thrown money in to plant; and the Lawrence Government made the promise, although it did not put anything in. The Federal Government, having put that money in to enable plantings to be made in New South Wales, has invested in the wheat industry and now Australia has been belted over the ear. However, with the advent of President Bush's first announcement, unfortunately this Federal Government led by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) did very little. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This morning I asked someone whether Mr Simon Crean is out of the country, because on this EEP announcement I never heard a noise from him. I know that he is the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and not the Minister for Trade, but one would think he would have made some kind of a noise. Just by his absence, he has astounded me.

If we look at the contradictory, inconsistent and incoherent response of the Federal Opposition on matters of trade over the last couple of weeks, we see that, firstly, Australia is about to join the North American Free Trade Agreement, according to the National Party. There is no evaluation of that. There is no assessment of the benefits.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, of course, the Opposition shifts ground to attack the Japanese. We have a bout of Japan-bashing. The stupidity of that is revealed the very same day when it becomes clear to the entire Australian population that we run a massive trade surplus with the Japanese and that our diplomacy with the Government of Japan over recent years has meant a significant opening up of the Japanese market to our products. Of course, we have repudiation not from the Government, the media and the Australian community alone but from the Japanese Embassy and the Embassy of the United States of America. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the ultimate evaluation of the stunts in which those opposite have been engaged. Contrast that with the approach of the Government which is multilateral and which has been consistent, coherent and coordinated. That is why Canada and Argentina approached us in terms of response to President Bush's announcement. Those opposite failed dismally during the 1960s when the UK went into the common market; they failed utterly. They failed to anticipate; they failed to prepare; they then failed to respond. The interests of Australian rural communities are much better safeguarded by this Labor Government than ever they would be under a coalition Government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just a moment ago we had an example of what I believe is a malaise creeping into this place. I believe that there is a problem with which we are all faced. It is a case of attack and counter-attack. It is a case of persons taking actions which, to their colleagues and to the Opposition&mdash;indeed, perhaps to the whole of the chamber&mdash;are not appropriate and then a reaction setting in. The matter we have just debated concerning wheat subsidisation was of sufficiently grave importance to this whole country for a ministerial statement to be placed before this chamber. Then there could have been a proper and full debate on that statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The action taken is a reaction to that failure and I believe that this is what we are seeing in the motion currently before us. We are dealing with a motion by Senator McMullan to restrict the time of speakers on motions to take note of answers to questions to a period of two minutes. I believe he is going to extend that time to four minutes. Regardless of whether it is two minutes or four minutes, it is still a retaliation for the action taken by the Opposition in the chamber on Tuesday. </PARA>

He would like to restrict the ability, and indeed the rights, of senators to express their views on behalf of the people that elect them. He does not care about the rights of the State of Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator does not. If he did, he would uphold the rights of this chamber. As senators we have imposed on us a duty to express our views on behalf of our constituents and particularly to uphold the rights of the States and the individual rights of citizens in those States. That is what this chamber is all about. It is also all about the audit and control of executive government actions. It is a very grave thing indeed to attempt to amend Standing Orders, which are designed to protect those rights. This motion, like the one carried on Tuesday, would tend to deny those rights and deny the ability of the chamber to hear adequate answers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, we have had a problem in Question Time over the last few weeks. The problem now, however, is that punitive measures are being meted out to all as a reaction to the excesses of the few. Sitting back here, one could see what was happening. Only one or two Ministers were making an absolute welter of Question Time&mdash;debating the point and answering at length the dorothy dixers and so forth. With respect to those Ministers, I think it was quite inappropriate. On the other hand, not last week but in weeks leading up to that, points of order had been taken by the Opposition almost ad nauseam and Question Time was becoming a bit of a shemozzle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are now faced with these punitive measures which are going to affect the whole of the chamber and the individual rights of each senator. It will not be too bad for the Opposition and it will not be too bad for the Government. In fact, I think both the Government and the Opposition secretly would probably agree with Senator Coates that the proposal has merit on its own. That would be only a very temporary conclusion. The Government should be aware that it is setting a precedent which can be used against it if and when the Government becomes the opposition. I believe that the Opposition, for its part, should take a long, hard look again at what was done on Tuesday and at what is proposed today, even if the four minutes is conceded and even if the time limit will be 60 minutes in total. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A valid point has been made by the Opposition. That valid point is that the development of the practice of taking note from time to time of Ministers' answers is probably better than proposing MPIs. I have no means of telling whether the total time used for taking note of answers has exceeded or been less than the time that would have been taken on MPIs forgone. The reason for that, of course, is that I do not know what was in the minds of those in the Opposition as to whether they intended to put in certain MPIs on certain days and instead of that have decided to take note of certain answers. I suppose that the situation we would have under the proposal put forward by the Government and the amendment put forward by the Opposition will not worry them too much, because the Opposition has 33 senators and the Government has 31. If they all take their two or four minutes, whatever it will be, they will cover the subject quite comprehensively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this also comes down to the question of what this proposal will do for the rights, responsibilities and duties of Independent senators and senators from the smaller parties. I think this time limit will substantially reduce and interfere with the rights of those senators. From memory, I have utilised the option of seeking leave to move to take note of an answer by a Minister only once. I believe that was reasonable and I believe it was effective because it got the point over and the point was ultimately responded to by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These particular proposals will not allow me as an individual senator to exercise that right in the same fashion as would be available to members of the Government and members of the Opposition, because they can have a whole team of people to carry on the argument over the period set for taking note of Ministers' answers. I believe that people should consider that matter when they are addressing this question and when they are voting upon this question. Who knows? From time to time people do make a decision to stand as Independents or indeed to be here as Independents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think there would be any problem at all in relation to Question Time if the rules for questions in the Standing Orders were observed. Let us look at them. Standing order 73 states:</PARA>

<PARA>If those rules were all complied with I suppose there would be no problem; there probably would be no Question Time either, if the truth is known. As Chairman of the parliamentary fellowship committee it would not be a bad idea to advertise for a researcher to do a bit of research on Question Time in the Senate to see how far these particular rules are observed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The questions arising out of this matter are quite serious. We have only two days left in this week. All I did yesterday was try to delay this matter for another day in the hope that it would be given mature consideration and in the hope that the sort of childish reaction which is taking place in this chamber would be circumvented and that precedents would not be established. If we carry this motion&mdash;even though it would apply only to the end of this sitting week&mdash;people are going to point to it in times to come and say, `Well, it was done there. This is one way of overcoming the situation'. I suggest that what we need to do now is to put it aside for another couple of days and then sit down and have a look at it. Perhaps some people need to be talked to and we need to see whether commonsense can prevail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) who is at the table that the ultimate sanction comes from within the parties. The ultimate sanction so far as the Government is concerned is that it can deny leave for a senator to move a motion to take note of an answer. There are the contingent notices of motion which can be utilised by certain senators. If the situation gets too out of hand, it is then for the colleagues of the offenders to say that enough is enough and that, if they continue to make a welter of it, the result will be a restriction of the rights of senators. That will ultimately backfire on those who are making a welter of it. In that respect, I include the couple of Ministers who have been extending their answers, which gave rise to the action taken by the Opposition on Monday, which in turn gave rise to the reaction that is taking place today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a supporter of the time limit for Question Time, which I remind honourable senators is on a trial basis only, I feel some responsibility for the reaction that has occurred to that proposal. I oppose strongly putting a time limit of any kind on the freedom of debate which offers us the opportunity to take note of the answer of a Minister. The implications of a time limit are very different within Question Time compared with outside Question Time and there are very different consequences.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the time limit in Question Time is to maximise the number of questions asked and to increase the number of senators who are able to participate; it is not to gag Ministers. If it is felt that two minutes is too short a time to allow Ministers to properly answer questions, then this time should be increased or the time limit should be abolished. However, the time limit for taking note of Ministers' answers has very different implications. It really has three undesirable effects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, it may gag a senator from entering into a dialogue or a debate on a matter of importance. Secondly, it may well force a practice of routinely taking note in such a way that it can be overused by always exercising that option for 30 minutes or, worse, for 60 minutes after Question Time and irrevocably change the practice of this chamber in a way we have not really thought through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, and most importantly to senators like me, but also to all of us, it reduces each person's time to two minutes or four minutes which penalises individual senators. It also means that one party could monopolise almost all of the time if its members organised themselves effectively. In my view it is the way in which the time limit was introduced into this chamber that has led to the problems which we are now facing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By using a contingency motion and immediate introduction rather than a notice of motion which allows all senators to give it consideration and to prepare for its effect on their participation in Question Time, we have seen a backlash occur. The backlash has occurred because senators and Ministers were unprepared to suddenly become concise either in questions or answers. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SN5">Senator CHAMARETTE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, but I believe it led to some very undesirable consequences. I suggest that those honourable senators who had questions and did not realise they had to compress them into one minute then felt they had a lot more to say that had not been said and so they took note of the answers. I also think Ministers who were unprepared to suddenly compress their answers to two minutes also failed to answer adequately the questions which were addressed to them. As a result of that we are facing difficulties. However, I suggest that the whole trial period of time limits for Question Time be allowed to run its course before considering further limitations that are resulting from this backlash. If we as the Senate wish to rise out of the gamesmanship and if we really want to evaluate the value of a time limit for Question Time, or for the period after it, we should not confuse the two by beginning the second change before completing the time period for the first. I therefore oppose this motion on two grounds. Firstly, it should not be introduced until after the results of the trial period for the time limit on Question Time has been settled. Secondly, I will vote against it on the ground that it is an undemocratic procedure which gags honourable senators who wish to draw attention to matters of importance and engage in dialogue with Ministers rather than simply make a short speech for two or four minutes.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise simply to urge honourable senators to consider very seriously the matters that Senator Harradine raised in his speech. Senator Harradine has been here for quite some time and he understands the way this House operates. Serious consideration should be given to the matters raised by Senator Harradine. I do not say I agree with all the matters he raised but what he said should be given some serious consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do agree with Senator Harradine that if the Standing Orders were followed many of the problems we have run into and which we have had to take this action over would not have occurred. Senator Harradine raised standing order 73 (i) which says that questions shall not ask for a statement of government policy. On a number of occasions I have raised this with the President by way of point of order and I have been almost contemptuously dismissed with the comment that if we did that we would stop Question Time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Question Time is not about expressions of Government policy. If matters of Government policy are to be raised that should be done, in accordance with the Standing Orders, by way of ministerial statement and the matter should be properly debated. As I understood it, the purpose of Question Time was to obtain facts from the Government about the Government's administration of this country and it was not there to give the Government a free kick on every occasion to make a policy speech on what the Government is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the President's view is correct and he enforced that rule, there would be no Question Time. If that is what the President thinks and if that is what the rest of honourable senators think, then we should get rid of that standing order. In my view, the standing order is quite clear. What the President and everybody else does here during Question Time is say, `Yes, I understand what the standing order says, but I don't believe it means what it says' when the words are quite obvious. So we continue to completely ignore and run contrary to the Standing Orders. If that is what we want to do, and that is a matter for everyone to decide, we should remove that standing order.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems quite ridiculous to me that this major chamber of legislation making in this country should make rules and then not abide by them. We make rules and we expect everybody else in Australia to abide by them on pain of penalty if they refuse, yet we make our own rules and completely ignore them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raised a matter with Senator McMullan by leave at the conclusion of the debate yesterday, but I want to raise a further matter briefly. If the procedure of taking note of answers is confined to half an hour, how will the President determine who is to get the call from all the honourable senators wishing to take note of answers? I suppose, for those in the Liberal and National parties, that is something for us to organise amongst ourselves and the President should have an easy job there. If what has happened in the past follows, whoever gets the call will move the motion and will be followed by quite a number of speakers. Senator Chamarette's comment that it will effectively cut out herself and Senator Harradine is very valid. Does the President then make an unwritten rule that he divides up the time to allow the Democrats to do it so many times and the Independents so many times?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly think that the time restriction on questions and answers has been a very good one. It is a measure that I personally would like to see made more permanent. I recognise that there is a need to have some restriction on moving to take note of answers, but what is being proposed is not reasonable. I urge, at least for the trial period, that one hour be allowed. I suppose in some way it could be justified by saying that Question Time lasts an hour, therefore, moving to take note of answers should last for an hour. I ask that honourable senators consider those matters, particularly those raised by Senator Harradine, when considering this proposal as a more long term operation. </PARA>

I and other members of the coalition think that the same should apply to the segment on taking note of answers. Therefore, I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After paragraph (c), add the following paragraph:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The import of that, for anyone who wants to follow it, is that if a Minister were to give an answer on a day to a question asked the previous day, it would still be capable of being taken note of. The day on which the answer is given is the trigger rather than the day on which the question is asked. It is a different concept from Senator Short's amendment, but it covers the point that Senator Macdonald raised yesterday and about which I undertook to come up with an amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whatever happens to the rest of the motion, I will accept the amendment which Senator Short has proposed today. I am quite happy for the people raising points of order not to be part of the time limit. It makes the management of it a bit more difficult, but it does mean that points of order are taken out as a time wasting tactic in these situations. I am happy to accept that part, but I do not accept any of his other amendments for the reasons we discussed before; I will not be repetitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accept&mdash;it may not be universal on the front bench and that may be because I am the only one here who does not get to answer questions&mdash;that there was a problem with the way Question Time was operating in this place. I do not argue that. I think the proposal we have to regulate it will not last as the proposal, but I am not averse to making Question Time work better. It is easy for me to have the luxury of doing that; I am the only one who does not have to deal with the consequences but, nevertheless, I accept that. I think most people would also accept that the procedural motion to take note of an answer, which I accept is a legitimate procedure, was being abused, and something needs to be done to regulate that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the proposal we have, particularly Senator Short's part (d), has some symmetry with the regulation of Question Time. I am happy to enter into some discussion on a long term basis about how we should regulate both, and perhaps other parts of Standing Orders, to balance the rights of senators to use all the mechanisms available to them under the Standing Orders and constrain their capacity to abuse those rights. I am happy to apply that balance of principles to Question Time. I do not think we have it right, but I am happy to address the principle. I am happy to apply it here and to address it at greater length.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister representing the Treasurer (Senator Button) in response to questions without notice asked by Senator West and Senator Michael Baume on 16 September 1992 relating to fringe benefits tax.</PARA>
<PARA>Colleagues will recall that one of the issues that was raised in relation to this question was the extension of fringe benefits tax to bodies in the public sector which have been largely exempt from the payment of this tax. I would like to know whether a fringe benefits tax would be paid in respect of the butler employed in Mr Keating's office. We have learnt in recent weeks that, unlike any other Prime Minister in the 92 years of Federation, Mr Keating actually has a butler employed in his office. We have heard that Mr Keating is a very wealthy man. There is no doubt about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the answers that were given by Senator Button during Question Time, the issue that is before this chamber now is who will pay the FBT for Mr Keating's butler-valet in his Parliament House office? Senator Button tried to pretend today that this tax is not actually aimed at State governments in the sense that State governments would have to pay further taxes. I think that is quite wrong and the debate, as it proceeds in the next few weeks, will show that to be wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have not heard how much Mr Keating's butler is paid. I have put a question on notice so that we can determine the salary that is paid to Mr Keating's butler. We want to know whether the Government is fair dinkum about applying the FBT across the board. Will Mr Keating's butler, as distinct from any other butlers that wealthy people in this country may have&mdash;the butler that Sir Peter Abeles may have, the butler that Mr Chris Skase may have had or the butler that Mr Laurie Connell may have had&mdash;be subject to the FBT? Under the old tax regime, these people presumably would have had to pay the FBT on those services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the question before this chamber is to what extent, if any, FBT is paid on the butler employed in Mr Keating's office. I think this is a big issue. It is an issue on which undoubtedly the community will focus its attention. This will be the symbol of how fair dinkum Senator Button is, how fair dinkum Mr Dawkins is and how fair dinkum Mr Keating is in constructing a tax system which is fair and equitable between all members of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Will Mr Keating's butler in Parliament House be exempt from the FBT? Will his second butler in the Lodge be exempt from the FBT? I note that Senator McMullan is very keen to get to his feet. We would certainly appreciate a very clear answer from him. The community will be demanding answers to that question. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is very interesting today to ask Senator McMullan to tell me how Mr Goss is going to get all the additional money that he will need to pay in fringe benefits tax in respect of all employees of the Queensland Government and its instrumentalities and authorities who receive a fringe benefit as part of their salary package. The fringe benefits tax will now be payable in increased amounts. We wonder where the Queensland Government is going to get that money from to pay that additional tax. Similarly, a lot of local authorities&mdash;and this is of interest to me&mdash;pay fringe benefits taxes. I understanding from the statement made today by the Government that fringe benefits taxes will bear increasingly on local authorities as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be very interesting to hear Mr Goss say whether he stands by the promise he supposedly made, or did make but did not keep before the last election, that he was not going to increase taxes. If he is not going to increase taxes, where is he going to get the money from to pay this increased incidence of FBT on instrumentalities, hospitals and so on? I would like to know. I would like to know the answer within the next couple of days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Queensland Budget is not a Budget. It was introduced; it is just a jumble of words. It was never debated or passed. But that Budget went along a certain line and certain money has been allocated for certain things. Yet we have a situation where now the Commonwealth is imposing an additional tax on the Queensland Government. Where is the Queensland Government going to get that money from? Is it going to cut back on services? Will it perhaps add a little more to the cigarette tax that it brought in the day after the Budget was presented. It brought in the so-called Budget one day. The next day&mdash;the first day of the campaign&mdash;it introduced a new tax on cigarettes. Maybe the cost of cigarettes will have to go up yet again to help pay for the fringe benefits tax that this Government has imposed upon the Queensland Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I call upon the smokers of Queensland to consider very seriously where Mr Goss is going to get this extra money from. Cigarette smokers are an easy target. Mr Goss has already proved that. If he has a shortfall in his Budget, he will not be worried about adding to the tax that he has already put on smokers. He will get the money by increasing the tax on cigarettes. Maybe he will consider a fuel tax. This is something that we have never had in Queensland before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this Government keeps imposing taxes on State governments and instrumentalities&mdash;instrumentalities which the State Government has to fund&mdash;and local authorities, which are funded in part by the State, in part by their own resources and in part by the Federal Government, then they all have to find the additional revenue to meet the additional taxes imposed by this Government. It is vital that the voters of Queensland know before Saturday just where Mr Goss will get this extra money from. What additional tax will he put on them? Will it be on cigarettes? Will it be on fuel? Will it be on stamp duty? Where are these additional taxes coming from? The people of Queensland deserve that answer before Saturday. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter was raised by Senator Kemp concerning the perks of office given to Mr Keating because of an article published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 21 August 1992. It became pertinent because of the announcement today that there is to be an increase in the FBT, which will fall again upon business and restrict the ability of business to create new employment. Also, there is the impost that Senator Macdonald has outlined which will affect the people of Queensland and Victoria, in particular, who are going to their elections, and Australians in other States because of the clawing back effect that this will have on finance assistance grants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason that Senator Kemp drew attention to the special fringe benefit given to the Prime Minister&mdash;that is, the services of a butler cum valet, not only in the Lodge, where one could see that that would be reasonable, but also in his parliamentary office&mdash;is that it is quite legitimate to argue that this is a fringe benefit of office bestowed on Mr Keating and a special privilege given to him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will read the description which leads to that conclusion. Senator McMullan can argue all he likes that this is not a special privilege on which FBT ought to be paid. We have already established in this place that there seems to be one relationship and one rule between Mr Boucher and Mr Keating, and quite another rule between Mr Boucher and everybody else. This is the special perk of office that comes with Mr Keating's butler. Mr Peter Hartcher writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister has a butler in his Parliament House office. His name is Guy. He is, by all accounts, a diligent and hard-working fellow who takes his job seriously, right down to the grey striped trousers and the resolute refusal to allow anyone. . . inside the Prime Minister's inner office in Keating's absence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">His employer summons him into the presence by means of a small hand-held remote-control device like a TV channel-changer.</PARA>
<PARA>Or a dog whistle, I suppose. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the Prime Minister is away from Canberra, he keeps himself busy making cakes for the 35 other office staff.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Guy is a careful, proper and fastidious little man and, for some perverse reason, the Prime Minister apparently enjoys shocking him. And so it was recently, as Keating returned to his office after holding court at a press conference.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Guy, waiting deferentially by the prime ministerial door&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know whether that is the new door we have opened up in his office at the cost of some $5,000&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to welcome his returning employer, took the liberty of telling Keating that he had handled the press conference&mdash;which Guy evidently had watched on the in-house TV&mdash;extremely well.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Keating paused: `Thanks. I'm a professional. A professional c&mdash;-.' It had the desired effect.</PARA>
<PARA>Charming language; charming treatment of a man who is presumably trying to carry out a job in a diligent manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that is being made, though, is that one can reasonably argue that it is not necessary for the purposes of running a ministerial office in this Parliament House to have a personal butler cum valet. I can understand that perhaps he has to lay out the expensive Zegna suits on which no sales tax is presently paid. Of course, when we have a reform in our tax system, the Prime Minister will be obliged to pay tax on his very expensive purchases and high living lifestyle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today we heard from Senator Baume that the Prime Minister is a very wealthy man and, as we have already pointed out, he seems to have that special relationship with the Taxation Commissioner. We have seen more taxes brought down by this high taxing Party. If one reads the statement by the Tax Office which seems to be the justification, one sees that it talks about the need for getting more money out of the ordinary Aussie battler; PAYE&mdash;pay all you earn. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Teague)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Order! Senator Watson, are you speaking to the motion moved by Senator Kemp?</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VJ4">Senator WATSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, that is the motion I am speaking to. The background to this is the legislation brought down in the House of Representatives, together with an accompanying income tax and enforcement strategy that was worked out by the Australian Taxation Office. There is an intriguing question to be asked behind this. Not only in the Budget recently brought down, but also in the Australian Taxation Office, the traditional preferred position is for deductions at source, which includes prescribed payments and withholding tax. These were outlined specifically in that Budget and referred to by our colleague in the other chamber Mr Reith as the hidden taxes. The question that I find so intriguing is: why has the Government now opted out in favour of the increased fringe benefits taxes which, I submit, are of dubious revenue implications? After all, the Government is doubling the amount of fringe benefit without providing the sort of mechanism that would enable that doubling effect to take place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to that extra imposition on fringe benefits, there will be stricter auditing compliances, including an extension of the tax file number. The whole concept behind the tax file number was privacy. If the tax file number is to be extended, the logical question to be asked is: will one have to quote one's tax file number when an electrician, plumber or any other tradesmen comes to the door and fixes up a household appliance? All Australians will be horrified when they learn of the extension of the tax file number. A Privacy Commissioner was installed at great cost, and rightly so, but his duties will be made much more difficult with the extension of the quoting of fringe benefits tax to all and sundry. How will the privacy aspects be implemented?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The big problem is that all these measures are designed to impact most severely on individuals and small business. I submit that the figures are here. Two-thirds of the money will come from those two sectors. I will quote from the minute paper from Trevor Boucher at the Taxation Office, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Earlier this year when addressing the question of domestic withholding tax I made the general point that, as a tenet of income tax administration, the most effective and efficient means of gathering tax is to have it deducted at source. I indicated that in moving from the general to the particular, matters would have to be worked through, but I now do not recommend any extension of deductions at source.</PARA>
<PARA>Here we are! Poor old Trevor Boucher is being used as a scapegoat for the Government's miscalculations. It has miscalculated on the amount and miscalculated on the impact it will have on individuals. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>I wish to address the totally inadequate response that the Government has provided to this action by the United States.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government on numerous occasions has said that it deplores the action and that it feels that the United States should not have done it, in the face of the action of the United States right now, today, announcing that it has, in fact, made a sale of wheat to Pakistan, a nation that is not in the traditional market of the European Community which the United States says is the market to which that particular EEP increase is directed. </PARA>

<PARA>Today in the Senate I asked a question of the Government in relation to the Tully-Millstream hydro extension project. When I moved to take note of the answer given by Senator Collins, I suppose it is something of a misnomer because no answer was given. This was in spite of the fact that Senator Collins has been the Minister assisting the Prime Minister on the Northern Territory for many years and should have been well aware of this particular matter, because most of the matters I raised in relation to the question occurred whilst Senator Collins was, in fact, the Minister assisting the Prime Minister on northern Australian matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On page 20 of his One Nation statement, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said that he was going to ensure that major projects were not held up by red tape and green tape particularly through his Government. As I said in Question Time, some 17 months ago a matter was referred to this Government in relation to the extension project&mdash;a $600m project that would create well in excess of 1,000 jobs, jobs that are badly needed in the Townsville-Cairns region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has this Government done about it? In the 17 months there has been a continual duckshoving between the Federal Government and the Queensland Government neither wishing to make any decision, neither wishing to take any responsibility in this major infrastructure project in North Queensland. There simply has been no decision making. The Government, after 17 months, cannot make a decision. In fact, I know why it does not want to make a decision&mdash;it is too hard for the Queensland Government and it keeps putting it off because it does not want to upset the vocal minority of people in Green movements and in its own Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the Cabinet Ministers in the Queensland State Parliament who are from North Queensland&mdash;Mr Smith; Mr Eaton; the Treasurer, Mr DeLacy; and one other whose name escapes me as they are not terribly high profile people&mdash;have all been on the record supporting this project because of the job creation schemes and the major infrastructure benefit that there would be to North Queensland if this project went ahead. They run around the north saying what a great scheme it is and why it should go ahead, but Mr Goss in Brisbane is too scared to make the decision for fear of running foul of the Greenies. So they have this imbalance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, if the Queensland State Cabinet Ministers who come from the north and who supposedly support this had any intestinal fortitude and courage at all, they would do something to force the issue. But they do not want to do anything about it, particularly before this Saturday, because Mr Goss's Government has been noted for the fact that it has not done anything wrong&mdash;but that is only because it has not done anything at all. It is a Government of committees. If anything needs to be done, a committee is set up to look at it and no decision is ever made. That is what has happened with this Tully-Millstream hydro-electricity extension&mdash;a marvellous project for Queensland and for job creation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government in Queensland simply cannot make a decision, yet its members run around the north postulating, saying the right words, but not taking the action necessary. They are a mob of wimps. They are not prepared to stand up for their constituency. The whole of North Queensland, all local authorities, all major organisations, businesses and development organisations support that project. Most councils and most civic leaders in the north support the project, but Mr Goss simply cannot make a decision because he is frightened of any backlash&mdash;and that is simply what the Queensland Government is about.</PARA>

<PARA>The reports I have tabled are the Committee's fifth and sixth reports for 1992. The fifth report relates to the Christmas Island rebuilding program, which was one of the most interesting inquiries the Committee has undertaken for some time. The aim of this project is to align conditions on Christmas Island with mainland Australian standards as part of a broader government policy aimed at the integration of Australia's Indian Ocean Territories within Australia. The need for major upgrading of the infrastructure on Christmas Island has been given impetus by the introduction of mainland Australian laws from 1 July 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rebuilding program will provide substantial new infrastructure for the island at a cost of $132.85m. At the time of the public hearings in May 1992 the Government had committed $37m for the next five years subject to the endorsement of the Committee. The most urgent works include a new and upgraded sewerage system and water supply, a new hospital, a new police station, extensions to the school, and<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">upgraded housing. Funding of the remainder of the works in the rebuilding program will be considered by the Government following the Committee's report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The existing infrastructure on Christmas Island was designed and built to meet the requirements and standards of a mining operation. Significant elements predate the Second World War. A period of renewed construction began after the war but by the mid-1970s construction activity had tailed off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the decline in mining profitability and the uncertain future of the island in the 1980s, there was little incentive to invest in maintenance of the island's infrastructure. The Committee was shocked, when it carried out inspections prior to the public hearings, to observe the appalling state of most of the infrastructure for the provision of government services on Christmas Island. In particular, the Committee was struck with the incredibly run-down condition of the hospital and the completely inadequate sewerage and water supply systems. In summary, most of the current infrastructure is more than 30 years old, in poor condition and does not meet current Australian building, health and safety standards. Western Australian Government agencies, which will provide most government services on behalf of the Commonwealth, have made it clear that existing conditions are completely unacceptable for their operations and staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the public hearing on Christmas Island, and having had the benefit of a thorough inspection of the existing infrastructure, it became obvious to the Committee that the $37m committed by the Government did not include all essential items. Those not included were: clearing of aggregate plant from the hospital site; power and water supply to the hospital site; new crane; and wharf and jetty upgrading. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The result of this situation is that while the hospital could be built, there were no funds to provide power and water supply. Even more serious was the situation regarding the port infrastructure which is completely inadequate to handle the increased volume of freight which will result from the rebuilding program. It is vital that the port infrastructure be upgraded as part of the initial funding program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of the Committee, the Chairman wrote to the Minister for the Arts and Territories (Ms Fatin) on 4 June 1992 indicating that in the Committee's view the priorities determined by the Government for inclusion in the initial $37m funding program did not include all essential items. The Committee suggested that the Government should consider increasing the amount committed over the first five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee is pleased to note that, following Budget considerations, the amount committed has now been increased to $42m to provide for additional items of critical importance including wharf improvements and a new wharf crane. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee recognises that the Government's commitment to rectify the immediate infrastructure, health and safety issues may stimulate private investment on the island and it has recommended that prior to the final commitment to the total 10-year rebuilding program there should be an assessment of the success of the initial funding program which may lead to changes in priorities and/or funding levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has made a number of detailed recommendations in the report for consideration by the Government and I will briefly mention a number of them. Heritage aspects have been given due regard and protection. However, the Committee has recommended that the fuel tank containing the Second World War strafing marks should be demolished with the panels containing the strafing marks being removed and displayed in a suitable location, at a cost of some $40,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee also believes that Christmas Island is an ideal location for a demonstration project to test the feasibility of alternative energy systems to augment existing conventional power generation systems in isolated communities. The Committee has recommended that DASET commence the collection of the necessary solar and wind data and set up a pilot plant to assess the feasibility of the chosen alternative energy system. DASET should include in the rebuilding program the sealing of the roads from the airport turn-off to Waterfall and from the golf course to Waterfall at a cost of $1.2m. These roads will soon become the busiest on the island and should be sealed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rebuilding program will provide an opportunity to implement training programs for local workers. The Committee has recommended that as a matter of urgency a scheme be set up to maximise training and apprenticeships. The Committee has also recommended that DASET should ensure the maximum possible use of local labour and materials in the rebuilding program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has recommended that a comprehensive strategy be developed to address the critical housing situation on the island. While funds are provided in the rebuilding program to upgrade housing for government employees, the Committee has recommended that the Government consider additional funding of some $16m to meet the Commonwealth's wider housing obligations on Christmas Island. Housing is an issue of considerable concern on the island and the Committee hopes the Government will give favourable consideration to extending the scope of the rebuilding program to address the overall housing problems, not just those of its employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee's sixth report relates to the refurbishing of the Perth branch of the Reserve Bank of Australia at a cost of $32.2m. The Reserve Bank has operated from its current premises in Perth since 1973 and the building no longer complies with current building regulations and some services are nearing the end of their operational life. The removal of fire retardant asbestos material is an important aspect of the work. If I remember correctly, it accounts for $11m of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee is satisfied that the refurbishment option is the most economical of the options available to the Bank. The refurbishment will proceed on a staged basis which will enable an assessment of the availability of tenants and market conditions in Perth before proceeding with the fit-out of tenanted floors. I commend the reports to the Senate. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was in a Senate committee room. It was a fairly vigorous discussion and it is still going on. But I was in continuum on the Swimming Pools Tax Refund Bill 1992. Before lunch I had just made the point that we are seeing one of the most dishonourable acts that we have ever seen in this Parliament. We have seen an agreement entered into between the Swimming Pools and Spas Association and the Australian Taxation Office in the following terms. The agreement states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pending a decision on its High Court challenge to the constitutionality of sales tax on pools constructed in situ, the SPASA entered into an agreement with the Australian Tax Office to continue to pay the 20 per cent sales tax on the basis that if the challenge was successful the sales tax would be refunded to its members, i.e. the pool builders.</PARA>
<PARA>That was acted on in good faith by the builders who were parties to the agreement. It was not acted on in good faith by the Tax Office. In the course of the Public Accounts Committee investigation into the Australian Tax Office, we have for the first time seen the Commissioner, senior officers and the Tax Office as a whole accountable. It is not an experience that they are used to or seem to enjoy.

This letter has been tabled in the Parliament. It is on the public record and when I asked tax officials at the supplementary Estimates hearings earlier this year how many ordinary Australians who were in a similar situation of having failed to put in two tax returns&mdash;this was the case with Mr Keating&mdash;or even one tax return, I was told by the Tax Office that nearly 10,800 ordinary Australian taxpayers were prosecuted for that offence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have evidence on the public record of favourable treatment being meted out to Mr Keating above and beyond nearly 10,800 ordinary Australians.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One could say that for the Commissioner to say that integrity is the most important thing to him does not sit well with his action to renege on an agreement into which he had entered. Ask yourself about the motivation. Why did he do it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Boucher has also been very strong on saying how he acts in a way that is not politically influenced. Yet he must have known of the legal opinions which the swimming pool builders had which showed that they would win that argument. It makes one question the sort of legal advice he received and what quality he put upon it. And, I dare say, there must have been a political backup that said, `Even if you lose, we will bring in legislation'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my book that is political influence of the worst sort, and we see it all here today. First of all, we see the Bill introduced. It purports to be a two-page, simple, nothing Bill. What do we get today? We get the amendments&mdash;pages of them&mdash;and pages and pages of explanatory memorandum. None of it fixes up the inequity that has been done. None of it rights the wrong of the Tax Office which purports to hold itself out as being fair minded and as exercising justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statement that Mr Dawkins put down today and the accompanying documentation included, among other things, a submission from the Taxation Office telling how, with good hard work and diligence, it can up the compliance rate. Up the compliance rate? What about its own compliance rate, its own compliance with an agreement it entered into? The submission then goes on, in a rather fatuous way, to say that it would get a better tax return rate, more money out of taxpayers, if taxpayers kept better records. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Boucher had better go and read the Auditor-General's report which castigated him for his bad record keeping. I read on to see that Mr Boucher reckons he can get more money out of the ordinary taxpayer if he is allowed to spend some more money on information technology. He has already spent $1.2 billion. What is the result of that? We have a special, nice little cosy agreement between the Taxation Commissioner and the Public Sector Union. It is a lovely little document whereby the trade union is given, at taxpayers' expense, things like an office in every branch, a desk, a lockable filing cabinet and a telephone with no bar on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to that, if any officer of the Tax Office actually spends all day, every day, on trade union business, that person is not allowed to be reprimanded and we, the taxpayers, have to find another officer to fill that position. I have sent that document to the Department of Finance to be costed, and I have in my mind a reasonable estimate of what that cost is going to be. Do those opposite think that the ordinary Australian taxpayer is going to be very impressed when told that, on the one hand, the Taxation Commissioner gives his money away to the trade unions and, on the other hand, that he reneges on a perfectly legitimate agreement that he has entered into with legitimate taxpayers?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said before that the Tax Commissioner's reputation has not really changed much since biblical times. He has not enjoyed a good press. When he does this sort of thing there is no reason why he should. We will take a serious look at the situation whereby almost one thousand people who were employed on the collection of revenue are now surplus to that requirement because of the $1.2 billion expenditure on information technology. Guess where they are now being employed? Under the PSU agreement nobody is allowed to be sacked. People are not even allowed, against their will, to be moved to a different CBD. Those people, for the most part, have gone into PR&mdash;at the taxpayers' expense to try to make the ordinary Australian citizen have some respect or liking for what goes on in that Tax Office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need a Tax Office that can be trusted. We need a Tax Office that can be respected. How on earth can we have any sense of justice or any sense of equity in the minds of ordinary Australians when there is special treatment for the Prime Minister and when the Tax Office, in a blatant form, reneges on a perfectly legitimate agreement? We have a very serious problem which we have to deal with. It is a crisis of confidence. For the Tax Commissioner on this occasion to argue that there was no political interference will not wash. Senator Watson has just come into the chamber. He brought down a minority report dealing with the referral of this Bill. I can only say that he&mdash;together with other coalition senators&mdash;expresses it in a very succinct manner, saying that the behaviour of the Tax Office is nothing short of a disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, I would like to bring into this chamber some of the correspondence I have received from ordinary Australian citizens saying how the might of the bureaucracy has been brought down on their heads and how they have been treated and abused. They are simple letters; there are no grandiose statements; there is no might to go off to the courts and fight the Tax Commissioner. They have no option but to pay up. When one reads of their plight and sees the sorts of people they are&mdash;from simple pensioners to people who are struggling to stay in business and employ a few people&mdash;one wonders just what the sense of justice and equity in our tax system is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition is addressing the question of justice and equity. Our tax reform proposals provide a plan that will allow justice and equity to come back into the system. But this Government is besotted. Because in 1985 the trade union movement denied it the right to introduce a broad based goods and services tax, we are stuck with this unfair, ramshackle system of wholesale sales tax which has so many anomalies and such a bias against certain parts of the economy that any people who have the temerity to stand up and justify it ought to hang their heads in shame. Mr Boucher may well cry out in hearings and say, `Our integrity is our most cherished virtue', but he must pardon the Australian people when they say, `Your words ring very hollow'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you. I will not take long on the Bill. This is a very important Bill and, for most people, a Bill that has required a lot of consideration because significant principles are in conflict. Most of the participants in this debate and the members of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration&mdash;the only Committee member present in the chamber is Senator Watson&mdash;and those who attended the Committee hearings spent a lot of time grappling with the difficult balance of principles involved; it was not easy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this Bill is to establish a refund code to deal with the refunds flowing from the Mutual Pools decision and to ensure that the amounts that will be paid by the Commonwealth get to those who actually bore the `tax'&mdash;I use that word in the same sense as Senator Short; we all know that literally this is no longer a tax, but one cannot speak in inverted commas so, like everyone else, I will continue to use that word. It has not been easy to strike the right balance, because an important question was established before the courts about the rights of people that should not lightly be dealt with by the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the time since the Bill went to the House of Representatives, the Government has received a number of representations, including those which flowed from the Committee discussions. Amendments have been circulated. I will not waste the time of the Senate talking about them because we will have the committee stage to consider them. The reason I refer to them now is to demonstrate that the Government's approach with regard to this legislation is specifically directed towards achieving the purpose of ensuring that those who bore the burden imposed by the legislation get every possible opportunity to obtain a refund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When thinking about support or otherwise for this legislation, one has to think about what happens if the legislation is not passed. It is true that it is important to consider the consequences of passing this legislation&mdash;and there are serious questions of principle at hand&mdash;but let us look at what happens if we do not pass this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Senate does not pass this Bill or a Bill to achieve this purpose&mdash;that is, to establish a just refund code&mdash;the consequences will be that those pool purchasers who actually bore tax will get nothing and those pool builders who were able to charge the cost to the purchaser will receive windfall gains of tens of millions of dollars that is the property of the taxpayers of Australia. It is not the Government's money; it is the money which belongs to the taxpayers of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to talk at length because we want to get on to the committee stage. However, in making that point, I want to simply refer to a letter in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> from Mr David Royal of Sydney, who sets out the case quite clearly. It is those who incurred the cost&mdash;the purchasers of the pools&mdash;who should be compensated. I draw honourable senators' attention to that article and another to similar effect in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier Mail</EMPHASIS> of 14 September, where pool purchasers are starting to realise the implication of what would flow from the decisions of the court if the Government took no action. They find that entirely unjustifiable, and they are correct. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>Mr President, these amendments address concerns raised in the debate on the Bill in the other place and by Honourable Senators since the introduction of the Bill into the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration considered the issues on Monday and discussed proposals for most of the amendments now being circulated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since that time further discussions have taken place between the Government and other Senators and representatives of builders and pool purchasers in an effort to resolve the perceived deficiencies in the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would observe that, while there has been much convenient criticism of the Bill there has been very little constructive criticism. I thank the Democrats for taking a constructive approach. The Opposition, by contrast, has been quick to criticise but their only amendment proposal is to simply hand builders a windfall gain at the expense of purchasers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments proposed by the Government will achieve the following results.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A pool builder who passed part of the `tax' on to the purchaser, subsequently refunded that `tax' to the purchaser, and also absorbed part of the tax will be able to lodge one declaration with the Commissioner to claim the full amount of the refund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pool purchasers will be able to obtain, direct from the Commissioner without the need for the money to pass through the builder, a refund of an amount paid as sales tax on a swimming pool by lodging a joint declaration with the pool builder. This will overcome any problem arising from the builder being out of pocket and having to borrow money to pay the refund to the pool purchaser before obtaining a refund from the Tax Office.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the pool builder has died or no longer exists, the pool purchaser will be able to apply direct to the Tax Office for a refund. The pool purchaser will have to supply the information needed to complete the necessary declaration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Interest will be paid to a pool purchaser who receives a refund direct from the Tax Office from the time the tax was remitted by the builder up until the time the refund is paid to the purchaser.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the purchaser gets a refund passed through the builder interest will be payable for the period beginning when the `tax' was remitted up until the builder makes a refund to the purchaser.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To assist a builder with costs incurred in preparing declarations that will obtain a refund for a pool purchaser, the builder will be entitled to receive an administrative fee paid out of the interest payable to the purchaser. The fee will be $100 or if the interest payment is less than $100 it will equal the amount of the interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To ensure that there is sufficient time for those who should get a refund to make a claim the period in which declarations can be lodged under the Bill has also been extended to two years.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition will not be opposing the Government's amendments because the thrust of the Government's amendments is to provide the mechanisms&mdash;the machinery&mdash;for purchasers to be paid under certain circumstances. The Opposition's view was that it was desirable to break the periods of payment down into two distinct categories: from the time the tax was introduced to the time that SPASAA entered into a legal contractual arrangement with the Tax Office&mdash;that is, the period from 1986 to 1990&mdash;and from 1990 to the present time, the time of the handing down of the High Court decision. We believe that High Court decision and the subsequent decision of the Federal Court have to be honoured and acknowledged. It was a very serious principle because the original Bill&mdash;but not these amendments&mdash;sought to retrospectively take away rights which had accrued following a High Court judgment. Therefore, the Government is now, by way of further amendments, seeking to facilitate that payment arrangement.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will explain the purpose of this amendment. I agree with the comments of Senator Watson that the Government's amendments go a long way towards meeting some of the complaints which were raised in the public hearing on Monday morning. But there is still one anomaly which the Australian Democrats would seek to rectify. That applies to the proposed new clause 4(5) of the Bill, which recognises that pool purchasers had no right to a refund under the original legislation if their pool builder had paid tax in respect of the pool but had then died or gone out of business,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the Government for recognising this anomaly and providing a mechanism for the pool purchaser to obtain a refund if one is due. But the legislation still does not recognise that there may be other reasons why a pool builder will not sign the necessary declaration to allow a refund to occur. It could be that there is a dispute between the builder and the owner over another matter; it could be that the builder's records have been lost or destroyed; it may be that the builder has lost his or her legal capacity. The possibilities are numerous and we think that the pool purchaser must be given the right to pursue his or her refund independently of the pool builder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The witnesses on Monday talked a lot about the need for cooperation. I am not saying that builders are going to be deliberately obstructive or that they are going to seek to frustrate the attempts of their clients to obtain refunds. In the last few weeks, pool builders and their representatives have constantly reinforced the fact that it is in their commercial interest to maintain good relations with their customers because the pool building industry relies very heavily on the goodwill generated by good service and referrals by previously satisfied customers.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Be that as it may, there must be a right for purchasers to claim independently of builders should such a need arise. Another reason is that this additional opportunity for refund will eliminate the suspicion that the Government was attempting to keep some of the money for itself by insisting that all refunds be channelled through the builders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the constitutional requirement concerning the acquisition of property on just terms, the legislation defers the making of a declaration until the Commissioner has contacted, or made reasonable efforts to contact, the relevant builder to ascertain whether the builder disputes or agrees with the proposed declaration. Appropriate appeal rights under the Administrative Appeals Tribunal are included for both the builder and the pool purchaser if necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the fact that we are able to agree upon this amendment is a good contemporary example of the Senate's role in making sure that the rights and the equity of all citizens are adequately addressed. I appeal to the Opposition to support this amendment, which I commend to the Senate. I wonder whether I could ask Senator McMullan a couple of practical questions on the declaration, because there may be a lot of situations where the owners cannot exactly identify the amount of tax paid in respect of their particular pool. I am not seeking to tie him down to any formula or any procedure, but I simply wish to get on the public record information which may assist pool purchasers who find themselves in a situation where they have to attempt to act independently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is there anything the Minister can tell us about how the Commissioner will treat such applications? If, for example, there is only evidence of a lump sum price and not the actual sales tax component, will the Commissioner apply a rule of thumb to such applica</PARA>
<PARA>tions? Will there be a flat amount of refund once it has been established that the pool has been taxed? Will there simply be a percentage, say, 6 or 7 per cent of the lump sum price? These are just some of the things that come to mind which pool purchasers would probably want clarification on before they go ahead. Obviously, they will hear about this decision and will immediately wonder what they are going to do about it. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now deal with the questions that Senator Kernot raised. Everybody who has been involved in this matter will be aware of the grave difficulty for the Tax Office in that usually only the pool builder will possess all the information needed to determine the amount of tax remitted and the amount passed on to the pool purchaser. But, in consultation, the Tax Office has indicated to me that it will be taking a reasonable approach to applications received from purchasers. It will be necessary for purchasers to supply sufficient information for a declaration to be completed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give an example of some of the sorts of things for which we will be looking, without being able to be comprehensive. The Tax Office will need to be satisfied, for example, that the tax was actually remitted and that the pool builder is either not entitled to a refund, cannot be located, has ceased to exist or is refusing to complete the necessary declaration that will result in the purchaser getting a refund. It is quite possible, of course, that a person will have a contract which makes it clear that sales tax was paid. That obviously would be evidence that would be persuasive if there is no contradictory evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In cases where most, but not all, of the relevant information is supplied by the purchaser, the Tax Office advises that it will take as flexible an approach as possible. For example, if the only information missing is the precise amount of the tax, it may be possible for a refund to be made based on the average amount of tax that was paid on comparable swimming pools. That generality, I think, will be helpful for people in providing a framework. There will not be many individuals in a position to take advantage of this, but such amendments are to deal with the isolated cases.

For example, a number of invoices from the pool builders to the purchasers would not have stated whether sales tax had been paid. Under those circumstances it would be very difficult to provide the necessary substantiation documentation, firstly,  to ensure whether tax had been paid in the first place and, secondly, the amount of tax. We know that there were a number of unscrupulous builders who did not even charge tax. The mechanism is far too loose. I would be surprised if the Tax Office itself, given its tight rein on substantiation, would be prepared to accept an amendment of this nature that is so open-ended.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, when we read clause 5 it sounds very nice. With regard to the first part, we could agree with Senator Kernot. However, there is a subtlety that she did not refer to, and that is `for any other reason'. `For any other reason' could also include getting around a High Court or a Federal Court judgment. That would cut across the very basis and thrust of our objection and our amendments. Therefore, while we agree with the sentiment of what Senator Kernot has spoken to, the amendment goes much wider, has more implications and cuts at the very heart of the concept of the rule of law by virtue of its open-ended nature. For that reason, the Opposition will not be able to support the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I move the amendments being circulated on behalf of the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, these amendments are consequential upon submissions that have been made to the Government and to the Senate Select Committee established by the Senate to report on the new streamlined sales tax Bills. The Committee's report has been tabled in the Senate today.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the time of introduction of the Bills in the House of Representatives, the Treasurer gave a public commitment to consult widely to ensure that the new system will operate as smoothly as possible. That consultation process has been facilitated by the establishment of the Senate Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After examination of the submissions and discussion with representatives of some affected industries, the Government has decided to make some changes to the Bills that will meet many of the concerns that have been raised. The Treasurer announced those changes on 11 August 1992. The Senate Committee, in its report, has recommended that the Senate pass the sales tax Bills, subject to the inclusion of the changes announced by the Treasurer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are six areas of change. These are:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the general anti-avoidance provision</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">leases</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">untaxed goods and the small business exemption.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now turn to the main features of the changes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">General anti-avoidance provision</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has been some suggestion that the general anti-avoidance provision is wider than its counterpart in the income tax law (Part IVA) and that, consequently, it could create uncertainty in the marketplace. The provision has been redrafted to clarify the circumstances in which it will apply. In particular, the provision will list the factors which the Commissioner must have regard to in deciding whether to cancel a benefit received under a tax avoidance scheme. Additionally, the dominant purpose test has been changed to refer to a purpose which is dominant as against the total of all other purposes for which the scheme was entered into rather than being compared against each of the other purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Leases</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After consultation with the leasing industry, the Government proposes to legislate, with modifications, some of the existing administrative arrangements which allow the benefit of the conditional exemption system to be available to lessors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In particular, the Government has extended the concessions that will be available for leasing stock, including leases granted on a short-term basis, so that exemption will apply if continuous short-term leases are granted in wholly exempt circumstances. Partial exemption will apply if short-term leases of goods are made in both taxable and exempt circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These new concessions will apply under agreements entered into between the lessor and the Commissioner of Taxation. The agreements will extend to parts and materials, and certain repair equipment, used in the repair and maintenance of the leasing stock.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The specific unconditional exemption for pallets provided for in the Bills will no longer be necessary under these proposed amendments for short-term leases and it will be withdrawn. Pallets leased on a short-term basis will be eligible for the same exemptions available for other short-term leases of goods.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A new credit provision will also be available for goods leased or loaned for a trial period and then sold in exempt circumstances to the same person. A separate provision will enable exemption to apply where one or more back to back sub-leases are interposed between the owner and the exempt sub-lessee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">External costs</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bills seek to bring into the sales tax base product design and development costs incurred by persons who are past the traditional wholesale taxing point (e.g. where design costs are incurred by a retailer who contracts out the manufacture of the goods). While there is some public recognition of the general need to tax these costs, a number of practical difficulties in applying the new provisions have been identified. In the light of these concerns, the Government has decided that the full external costs provision should not be proceeded with at this time in order to allow a further examination of the issues identified. However, the proposed external costs arrangements will continue to apply to royalty payments, except that liability will be limited to the value of the royalty payment attributable to the goods. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Exempt use</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bills require the immediate user of taxable goods to qualify for exemption rather than the ultimate user. The change was made to clarify the existing law, which is very unclear in this area. During the course of consultation, a number of specific examples have been identified where exemptions that are currently available under the existing law will not be available under the new law. The Government considers that some of these existing exemptions should be retained in the new law. The new law will be extended to provide exemption for the following goods:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. goods donated to, or by, exempt bodies (such as certain charities) and goods for use as prizes or awards by exempt bodies;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. parts and materials used in the repair or maintenance of goods owned by goods producers and exempt bodies (such as Governments and certain charities) if the property in the parts and materials passes to the exempt person; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. goods that, under a contract with an exempt body, become part of buildings or other structures owned or leased by exempt bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. goods that become part of a building or other structure leased to an exempt body</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Deemed manufacturers</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will maintain the business inputs concessions available to certain classes of deemed manufacturers under the existing law. If a person supplies materials to a manufacturer to be made up into goods for resale by that person, the existing law deems that person to be the manufacturer and liable to tax on the goods. The deemed manufacturer is, however, eligible for certain business inputs concessions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new law will not have a concept of `deemed manufacturer'. Instead, liability will fall on the actual manufacturer. This will have the effect of removing business inputs concessions from persons who are, under the existing law, deemed to be   manufacturers. However, following representations from industry, the Government has decided to allow the concessions which currently apply to deemed manufacturers to continue, but only where the made-up goods are mainly for wholesale sale by such persons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Untaxed goods</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As presently drafted, the new law will impose tax on goods that have been subject to the small business exemption where they are subsequently sold by retail or applied to own use by another business. However, there are concerns that some businesses (in particular, retailers), which are not generally liable to tax on their sales, would have difficulty in identifying and valuing the goods for the purpose of meeting the wholesale sales tax liability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government accepts these concerns and will amend the untaxed goods provisions to remove the liability on retail sales and applications to own use of goods that have previously been exempted from tax because of the operation of the small business exemption.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, these amendments indicate a willingness on the part of the Government to take on board the concerns expressed by industry and other interested persons about certain aspects of the streamlined sales Bills. The Government will continue to consult widely on the new law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the amendments to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Initially I want to speak generally in order to seek some clarification from the Government as to the reasons for the amendments being put before this chamber. The Government announced in the 1990-91 Budget that it would undertake a major review of the sales tax, which encompasses something like 27 Acts, with a view to simplifying a regime that even it acknowledged had become very cumbersome, burdensome and anomaly ridden over the years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government, or more particularly the Australian Taxation Office, undertook what we were told was a very extensive and exhaustive review of the existing sales tax legislation. The Government came up with a set of proposals which were announced by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) in, I think, April of this year in terms of the general direction in which the Government was going to go by way of its proposed simplification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bills were introduced into the House of Representatives late in May and were guillotined through that chamber without any substantive debate at all. The question arises as to why the amendments are now before us. The amendments that we are about to consider completely or to a very large degree undermine and certainly emasculate the Bills that were introduced as a result of the Government's review. Given that the Government had said that this was the most extensive review of and change to sales tax law since its origin in 1930, one can only express surprise that it has now seen fit to produce a whole raft of fundamental amendments which undermine many of the key so-called simplification changes that were to be introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also remind the Committee that the changes which foreshadowed the actual amendments that we are considering now were announced by the Treasurer at something like six o'clock in the afternoon of 11 August 1992&mdash;just 12 hours before the select committee which this chamber had set up to examine the Bills was due to hold its first public hearings on the 150 submissions that had been received. This select committee was established as a result of concern expressed by the coalition following an enormous number of representations and expressions of concern right across industry and the wider community following the initial introduction of the six Bills in May. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was no indication of what was to follow when this legislation was guillotined through the House of Representatives and introduced into the Senate in June. Had the Senate not agreed in its wisdom to establish a select committee, we would not be here debating these amendments because the original Bills would have become law before these amendments were even dreamt of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole exercise that the Government has been engaged in in terms of amending the legislation in such a fundamental way smacks of very hasty changes to what it claimed to be legislation designed on the basis of the most thorough of reviews. The amendments that were announced by the Treasurer on 11 August, but which were not available until after the Select Committee had in fact reported to the Senate, added great confusion to the Select Committee's deliberation on the Bills. As I said, the Select Committee has examined submissions received from 150 interested parties right across the Australian community. These submissions had been prepared on the basis that the Government was serious about introducing the six Bills that it had guillotined and jackbooted through the House of Representatives&mdash;and it had attempted to do the same in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have never had a full explanation as to why these amendments are considered necessary and why the Government has introduced them. The only conclusion that one can reasonably come to is that the Government panicked when it found that it was unable to prevent the establishment of the Senate select committee. It would appear that it deliberately sought to undermine the work of that committee by trying to accommodate some of the concerns that were expressed and contained in the 150 submissions that the committee had received. I understand that many of those concerns had been expressed to the Tax Office from the date the legislation first became available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the Government has engaged in a major back down by introducing these amendments to its so-called fundamentally changed legislation. Quite obviously, the timing of Mr Dawkins's announcement that he was going to make these changes was designed to pre-empt the strong criticisms of his proposals that had been expected to be aired during debate by the select committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This follows the usual practice of this Government, and in particular this Treasurer, in that he kept his announcement until as late in the day as possible to attempt to minimise the adverse comment from the media and accounting experts, and from those who had worked very hard to make submissions to the Select Committee only to have the ground cut from under their feet at the very last minute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before we get into the debate on the individual clauses and amendments that are before us, I would like an explanation from the Government as to why these amendments have been made, and why the Government has seen fit to so emasculate the legislation that it claimed was fundamental to streamlining and increasing the efficiency of the sales tax regime. Why has it taken this step?<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Does it accept the view that these amendments emasculate in key areas the Bills that it introduced in May? Those areas are very important areas indeed. They are, to quote the Treasurer himself, the areas of the general anti-avoidance provision, external costs, exempt use, deemed manufacturers, untaxed goods and the small business exemption as well as the important area of leases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are not small beer. They are very important areas indeed in the totality of what the Government was purporting to be wanting to do in terms of its changes to the sales tax regime which has been in existence for so many years. The debate on the individual amendments would be helped very considerably if the Government could give the chamber some understanding and explanation of just why these amendments are being proposed now, what the basis for them is, and, very importantly indeed, what they do to the totality of the legislative proposals that were originally introduced in May by the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to press Senator McMullan a little further. Senator McMullan gave a complete non-answer to the fundamentally important questions that I have raised. Let me summarise them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Question one is: why did the Government move these amendments which so emasculate the legislation that it rammed through the House of Representatives, and that it said was required in order to have a proper simplification&mdash;to use its word&mdash;of the sales tax regime? I put it to Senator McMullan that it is simply not credible to say that the changes that the Government has made in the six areas that are, essentially, involved in these amendments do not very considerably affect the legislation that he is talking about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, the Government placed great weight on changing the law in relation to deemed manufacturers. Now the Government has essentially given that away. The Government placed great weight on the need for change in terms of external costs. Essentially, it has given that away. It has done exactly the same in terms of exempt use. It has made major changes to its proposals in terms of untaxed goods and small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without arguing the rights or wrongs of the particular amendments that the Government is proposing, what I am putting is that they very fundamentally affect the original legislation. This Senate requires a explanation of that and the implications it has for the Government's whole approach to indirect taxation, because this is what these Bills are about. These are the Government's attempted answers to the proposals of the coalition for the introduction of a goods and services tax. We have always said&mdash;and this is the reason why we will be introducing a goods and services tax on coming to government&mdash;that the wholesale sales tax is so fundamentally and inherently flawed that it cannot be an efficient, fair and equitable tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government claims through the simplification exercise that it undertook over nearly a two-year period that it was really going to knock this sales tax regime into shape. Then, at 24 or 48 hours notice, the Government took a political decision that it was going to move fundamental amendments to its own legislation. I repeat, these amendments would not have been made had the Government had its way in the first instance and got this legislation through the House in June. The Government opposed the establishment of the Select Committee. It was only the establishment of the Select Committee that forced the Government in the end to make these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For Senator McMullan to come in here and not give this Committee an explanation of the reasons for that quite extraordinary action is, with respect, reprehensible. If Senator McMullan expects this Parliament to be able to give the Government's proposed amendments proper, logical and reasoned consideration, he owes it to the Parliament to give an explanation as to the reasons for his actions. I ask Senator McMullan again whether he could provide that explanation to form the basis for a sensible debate and consideration of the amendments that the Government has now circulated. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like him to explain, at the start of this Committee debate, the reasons for these amendments and the background to them. Why were they introduced so late in the piece? Why were they introduced seemingly to undermine the work of the Select Committee? Why were they introduced not much more than a month or so after the Bill, seemingly to the Government's satisfaction, went through the House of Representatives as drafted and was attempted to be pushed through the Senate as well?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments would not now be being debated here&mdash;they would not have been produced&mdash;if the Government's own timetable for the passage of this legislation through both chambers had been adhered to. If the Bills that were introduced into the Parliament in such great haste and with such a fanfare by the Government as being the greatest thing in 60 years resulting from the greatest review, how on earth can that argument sit logically against the subsequent actions by the Government of introducing a major range of amendments to those Bills, which have a very significant impact. Those Bills remove from the sales tax regime many of the areas that the Government told us were important including the deemed manufacture provision and the others to which I have already referred. Why is it that so soon after the original Bills were pushed through the House of Representatives and attempted to be pushed through the Senate that such a need for change was found to the extent that these amendments were necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely if the Government had done its work and the Taxation Office had been satisfied with the work that it had done in the exhaustive, I presume, and extensive review over two years&mdash;although we were told in the Select Committee that there was very little consultation in the course of that review with the clients of the Taxation Office&mdash;why was that not sufficient? I do not know whether that is true or not but that is what we were told. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How come we are now, as a Parliament, being asked to consider amendments which were not deemed necessary at the time the Select Committee was established. That was a time when the Taxation Office knew the objections that had been raised and the concerns that had been expressed. It was not that it had to wait until the 150 submissions came up before the Committee. Most of the objections that had been raised had been raised earlier than that and yet no action was taken. Why is it that this action was then deemed to be so necessary given that, in several key areas, the changes brought into this place in the first instance were fundamentally different?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McMullan can shake his head, nod and do whatever he wants to. I know that it has been a long, hard week, and it might be a harder night at the rate he is going. But this chamber does deserve and, I put to you, require courteous treatment by the Government. That courtesy involves fundamentally an adequate explanation of why we are doing what we are now doing. I ask Senator McMullan again, as a matter of courtesy, to explain to us the reasons why those changes were necessary and, if they are necessary, why they were not taken into account in the course of the review that took nearly two years to produce the legislation. Why were they not incorporated in the Bills that Senator McMullan said were so urgent that he wanted to bulldoze them through both Houses? The Government managed to do that in the House of Representatives; it did not manage to do it in this chamber. Once again, I ask for an explanation of that. Such an explanation will considerably help the subsequent consideration of the individual amendments that Senator McMullan is proposing. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government sought to reduce 29 Acts of complex legislation involving sales tax to approximately six. It was a process that involved something like two years of extensive inquiry by the Australian Taxation Office. Unfortunately, in order to counteract the legitimate issues of Fightback, the Government sought to expedite that simplification process, and there were some problems. In those problems we had a new set of six Bills. The Opposition referred those Bills to a Senate select committee. Prior to the Senate Select Committee on Sales Tax Legislation sitting, the Government came down with a whole range of changes which completely altered whole sections of that legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, we would have been consulting in a different manner about the Bills but we did not have that opportunity. That was fine and we therefore changed the way we operated and adapted to the majority wish of the Senate. We did not have any choice but we happily did so, as Opposition senators know.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) made it clear in his statement of 11 August that the consultation process had been facilitated by the establishment of the Senate Select Committee on Sales Tax Legislation. It was not the only way to do it but it was workable. I do not think that it is actually in the press release, but he made it clear in public on a number of occasions&mdash;and I reiterate&mdash;that we would not accept amendments that changed the fundamental nature of the wholesale sales tax legislation. We rejected people who wanted to make amendments that made the legislation similar to the GST, as some did. Some wanted to come and say, `Well, we will amend this wholesale sales tax', and at the end of the day we had a set of policies that had all the features that we do not like about the Opposition's policies. Therefore, we rejected those. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They were contrary to the core concepts of the wholesale sales tax. For example, those suggestions started to do away with the capacity of our legislation to distinguish between socially, environmentally and economically desirable activity and undesirable activity that the wholesale sales tax retains. That is a core concept and we had no intention of doing away with that; thus we rejected all those suggestions. There are some suggestions which are still being pursued in this chamber by the Democrats, with which we disagree. In this instance they do not go to the core concept, but we do not like the form in which they are being proposed; so we will not support them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From over 150 submissions that were received and the responses that were then available to the legislation, the Treasurer indicated that there were six areas of change that we were prepared to accept. He set out those on 11 August in detail. They are on the public record. He set down the nature of the representations which were made on each occasion and why we were responding to them in the way we were. Sometimes we accepted people's proposals entirely; at other times we did not accept their proposal but said we would respond in part. In some cases, in order to allow further examination we said that we would not be proceeding with certain things at this time. So the responses are qualitatively different from different aspects of the proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to that, I have circulated to honourable senators the speeches that would otherwise have been made in moving the various Government amendments. Those are available; they set out the reasons for each amendment. Therefore, there seemed to me to be two causes of concern in so far as I can discern any essential core concepts in Senator Short's concerns. That is, as best I can distil them, there are two problems. One seems to be that we should not have amended the Bill at all because we must have thought it was wonderful because we put it through. I will go back to make it clear. We still support the core simplification concepts set out in diagram 1 and we would have not accepted changes that went to undermine the nature of that reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We always made it clear that there would be a consultative process. This is not the process we would have chosen, but it has led to this result. We are happy with some of the amendments as a long term proposition and some, as we have made clear, may only be made to facilitate further review. That is the nature of the parliamentary and democratic process; we are not concerned. This passion about our being embarrassed is wrong. We are very proud of this package. It will be very effective in achieving its economic purposes. It will make the administration of the wholesale sales tax more efficient and the compliance costs lower. It will retain those features of the wholesale sales tax that we wish to retain and improve in some other areas its operation. That is what we set out to do. We did not set out to change its fundamental nature, but to simplify it and to reduce the administrative and compliance costs associated with it. Other changes have been made to wholesale sales tax with regard to things such as business inputs, which are not related to this legislation, but all of which are part of the program of reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the best I can distil that there is some concern, that, I think, is the answer to it. If it is not, I do not have an answer to it; let us get on with the business. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the short time that is available this evening I will say a few words on this sales tax simplification Bill, as it has been expressed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A bit earlier this evening I heard Senator McMullan say that he could not see why we do not hurry it through this place much sooner and he made mention of the time that we have wasted. After the House of Representatives spent 37 minutes on this Bill&mdash;last June, I presume&mdash;it passed, without the scrutiny it should have had, and came to this place and the Government expected us to pass it under guillotine in the same period. Since then there has been a short inquiry into it&mdash;and how many amendments have there been from the Democrats, the coalition and even the Government since that time? Bearing that in mind, I cannot see any reason for rushing this legislation through right at the present moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As taxation officers themselves said quite some time ago, they were battling to understand it themselves. One is on record as saying&mdash;and I mentioned this in my speech in the second reading debate&mdash;that it took him three days to read the damn thing and even after that he did not necessarily understand it. I therefore believe that this legislation is anything but simplification. As a result of that short inquiry held into this legislation last June-July or whenever it was, a lot of the measures that the Government was going to bring in have been dropped&mdash;such as sales tax being paid on farm machinery while it is sitting on the block, and stock while it is sitting on the shelves waiting to be sold. A lot of those measures have been taken out of the legislation. That is indicative of what this Government does at times&mdash;it makes an announcement and, when it finds out what the reality is, it backs off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A good example of this is the announcement of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) this morning. Following the Opposition pointing out the secret taxes that existed in the Budget, he has made some changes. For instance, he said he was going to have a withholding tax on the interest earned at the banks, and now he has backed off from that. His reason for backing off from that, I believe, is that he did not do his homework in the first place. I will get back to the Bill in a minute&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I fully understand that, but I was using this as an example of the Government making announcements and then changing its mind as it goes after seeing the obvious. I was simply using that as an example. There were many other things that changed, as I said, like the sales tax on farm machinery while it sits on a block. I am glad Senator Kernot is back in the chamber now. In that situation the sales tax was to be paid and then, when it went to an exempt purchaser, it was to be refunded. Now I see that has been dropped from the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>

She wrote to farm machinery dealers, after they had pounded her with facts on top of facts on the matter.

But in Senator Kernot's written reply to all the farm machinery dealers of Australia&mdash;and she knows what I am talking about; the letter is there and I will show it to her in a moment&mdash;she first of all took the credit for the disappearance of that measure from the sales tax Bill and then went on to say, `Of course, under the GST package you will to have pay that anyhow and leave it there until the end of the reporting period'. She did not even say, `until the end of the reporting period'; she said, `while it is on the vacant block'. That is the point.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Kernot has been caught wanting before, so she should not interrupt me now. That is where this Government has gone. I would like to know the rationale for some of the decisions it has taken, like taking away the sales tax exemption for four-wheel drive trucks where the four driving wheels happen to be at the back end of the vehicle rather than at the front. About 18 months ago a tax ruling was issued by one of the Tax Offices in Australia allowing that sort of vehicle an exemption. It was a valid exemption then, under a tax ruling&mdash;it was not a court decision or anything like that; it was a tax ruling by the Commissioner. That was allowable where such a vehicle was used in primary production. That applied to a four-wheel drive vehicle&mdash;a truck, whatever size it was&mdash;where there was tandem drive; in other words, it was four-wheel drive but the four driving wheels were at the back. The Tax Commissioner gave his ruling that that qualified for exemption. Now this Bill specifically removes that exemption. I have not heard any rationale for this. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan), who is at the table, will give us a reason a bit later on as to why the exemption for such a vehicle should be removed&mdash;because it is a four-wheel drive vehicle, the four-wheel drive being on the rear end rather than being used to steer as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like an explanation for that. Why should one four-wheel drive vehicle be different from another one the same size doing the same job, carrying the same weight and transporting the same material just because, of the four driving wheels, two are up the front and two are down the back while the other has four down the back? I have not had a logical explanation, and I would like to have one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are vast numbers of problems with this Bill because it tries to be all things to all industries. I believe that it should at least have been referred to a fully fledged committee rather being considered in the short inquiry that was undertaken, although a reasonable amount of good work was done on it in that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my belief that the whole package of Bills should be removed from the timetable altogether. After all, the Government is still collecting about $10 billion a year in sales tax. It will not necessarily be revenue neutral. I know that it will collect more by this new system than it did before, so it is not a matter of simplification. It is a matter of catching more sales tax in the net. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Seeing that the next election is so close at hand, I believe that this legislation should be put on the backburner. The Government could put this package up as its policy for the next election. If this Bill is it, so be it. It can send it out to the voters of Australia to judge it for themselves, just as they will judge our GST package over the next six months, nine months, four weeks or six weeks, depending on the date of the next election. That is the best advice that I can give the Government on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a pity that the others who claim to know their sales tax laws and claim to know how the GST works do not do that rather than make rash statements as did Senator Kernot when she upset a number of the machinery dealers around Australia. She led them to believe that that was how it was going to work. It was a total untruth. Even I started having a few doubts that I was right&mdash;I am generally right on these things&mdash;so I went through the GST package again and got the right advice from the people who wrote it. What Senator Kernot said is incorrect. The most decent thing that she could do is to write to all those machinery dealers to whom she has given the wrong message in the last few weeks and give them the right message&mdash;that is, that under the GST system sales tax that is paid by the retailer to the wholesaler on purchases to put on his block will be fully refunded without waiting for the end of the reporting period. </PARA>

<PARA>This is an unusual subject to talk about&mdash;the differentiation of a sales tax system in relation to microchips. The Government intended to tax computer programming to the extent that it is hard-wired inter-componentry in the way that a microchip is. It correctly treats such programming as intrinsically physical and unalterable and therefore a taxable good. But it also treats software, such as alterable software, which is embodied on a floppy disc, as not physical in nature and therefore certainly not a good. Because of that, the software is not taxable under the wholesale sales tax. I do not have a problem with that sort of differentiation but I think the structure of the legislation did not anticipate nor make provision for the sort of emerging technology that we now see in this field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current legislation exempts from tax all computer programs other than those `embodied on a microchip'. The word `microchip' was chosen because it was thought that software embodied in a microchip was embodied in such a way as to become permanent. It assumes that all microchips are what they call hard-wired. Whilst this was once the case, technology has overtaken legislation in this area. There is a type of microchip which we call an EPROM&mdash;erasable programmable read only memory. That type of microchip is now disadvantaged by the outdated definitions in this Bill. The EPROMs have software embodied in them. However, the microchip can be erased and/or reprogrammed. Quite literally, the EPROM is more like a floppy disc than a microchip, but the legislation imposes a tax disadvantage on this EPROM. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us think about the recent debate on telecommunications and pay television. In both of these situations there was a conscious and I think a correct decision to be technologically neutral. We know we are going to have innovation. We want that technological innovation to have an opportunity to flourish. It is our argument that that principle should be extended to sales tax law.

If he attempts to say that, I remind him that in this very Bill the Government is using the simplification process to change the classification of unprocessed bottled mineral water from being taxable at 20 per cent to being exempt. One would hope for some consistency. If we are to be consistent we cannot say it is okay for bottled mineral water but it is not okay for EPROMs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Kernot said, this is a technical matter and we should not all stand here pretending to have a level of expertise that we do not have about the technology. That is not really necessary to deal with the tax effects that we are trying to come to grips with here. The wording is complicated with EPROMs, as Senator Kernot has said. I think the principles are fundamentally unaffected by whether it is a high-tech product we are talking about or some other sort of differentiated product. There is no crisis about differentiating where the circumstances are different. In each instance one has to look at the consequences of the distinction people are trying to make.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendment seeks to have the value of software that is embodied non-permanently on a microchip, such as EPROM, treated as tax-preferred software over `permanent microchips'. This would mean that, in the case of a mobile phone with the tax-preferred microchip, the taxable value would exclude the value of the software, which is around 40 per cent of that phone. The argument that is put in favour of this proposed exemption is that these EPROMs, as with software contained on other temporary media such as a disk, can easily be upgraded or modified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, I accept that it is argued that EPROMs are more accessible to domestic manufacturers because they are more suited to shorter production runs, but it is hard to see why there is a competitive disadvantage to people from the proposed uniform treatment. Our concern is really to the contrary: providing an exemption for EPROMs would disadvantage competing goods that have software embodied permanently on microchips. For example, I am advised that at least one sort of mobile phone uses permanent microchips and therefore would be at a disadvantage when compared with some of its competitors that use EPROMs. </PARA>

I do not see the benefit. One is being advantaged over another and it is possible that this could lead to a significant erosion of the tax base as an incentive would be given to people to use those sorts of microchips. There could be a significant proliferation of its use and further distortions could be created between goods which utilise EPROMs and goods using permanent microchips. Therefore, we do not support the exemption for reprogramable memory microchips.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The amendment has a number of attractions to the Opposition in that the sales tax legislation in this country frequently lags behind current technical developments. Australia has a good reputation for technical innovation. We have a company here, Voxson, which is essentially the manufacturer and which is going to be principally involved in this operation. As such, it could be disadvantaged in relation to certain imported products that do not have the same degree of sophistication admittedly, but in terms of price and performance would be deemed to be competitive businesses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter that concerns me is that because there is such a big market in Asia and the competition largely comes from there, this corporation has the potential, if it is priced out of its Australian market, to move north. I believe that an unintended consequence of this sales tax legislation could be the loss of a potential industry, the very industry that Australia should be encouraging, and this would be detrimental. While I believe that this Senate should not be used to introduce or to provide changes which will impact heavily on the revenue of this country, I do think that from time to time there are circumstances where the law has failed to keep abreast of the technical know-how and that Australian ingenuity could be prejudiced as a result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of that, I am reluctantly persuaded to support the amendment in this case. During my discussions with the Parliamentary Secretary, he accepted the reasons. I must point out that this is consistent with the stand we took in 1989 and 1990 when the sales tax legislation failed to acknowledge another technical development affecting a product of Australia in terms of the plugging effect of these particular microchips. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1986, sales tax legislation was amended in an attempt to make this computer software subject to sales tax. As a result of those amendments, all software embodied in a medium was effectively made subject to tax. Naturally, these amendments caused very great problems in the software industry and eventually in 1990 the sales tax legislation was once again amended to remove sales tax on computer software other than that which is embodied permanently in a medium. The problem words were `permanently embodied in a medium' and this caused problems in relation to those items that were plugged in and, today, it involves that new technology where certain programs can be erased. This is a significant development and I submit to the Parliamentary Secretary that the choice of the word `microchip' in the legislation was unfortunate because it does apply in a highly technical sense to microchips, which are goods into which programs are embodied on a permanent basis. </PARA>

The Government is proposing to alter the current X3 system of sales tax free sales, which allows the sale of stock tax free to Australian and foreign nationals who are travelling overseas. There is currently a procedure which people have to go through. The Sales Tax Assessment Bill proposes to abolish this procedure for Australian nationals yet retain it for foreign visitors. That means that Australian nationals will be able to purchase goods for export sales tax free. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation proposes to completely revolutionise the administrative procedures which used to apply and which will be so different now. The Government wants to introduce a system known as a sealed bag docket plucking system. This is the type of arrangement which applies in duty free sales. It involves 100 per cent verification of the fact that the goods are actually exported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Select Committee on Sales Tax Legislation heard two very differing views on this issue. On the one hand, the duty free operators said that they would be happy with such an arrangement, so happy that they will even volunteer to administer it for the retailers&mdash;the jewellers and the photographic dealers&mdash;who will be affected by these changes in the administrative procedure. But those affected, the jewellers and the photographic dealers, said that they were unhappy about the cost&mdash;that is one consideration&mdash;but more than that, they were very wary of their competitors potentially being able to obtain their confidential sales information and for the duty free operators to be in control of the whole verification process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was really hard to make a decision on whose arguments and whose objections were the more convincing. Despite the allegations that massive rorting is going on at the moment under the X3 system, nobody has been able to provide me with evidence of this. I have requested it on several occasions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Darryl Somerville, who appeared before the Select Committee for the jewellers and the photographic dealers, made what I think is a very salient observation. He rejected the assertion that the X3 system was really open to massive rorting. He pointed out that it is much simpler to provide a false registration number&mdash;in other words, it is much simpler to fraudulently quote and get the goods tax free&mdash;than it is to provide passport details and a copy of travel documents, which the X3 system demands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for these reasons and the possibility that the new system would impact adversely on some local businesses, which will lose what have been increasing sales to Australians travelling overseas, that I am opposing the introduction of a full verification system for the tax free sales of exported goods at this time.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not opposed to change.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The problem with the X3 system is that there has been substantial evidence of abuse.

I will answer Senator Kernot later and use a preamble to answer Senator Watson's question. When audit activity is undertaken pursuant to the X3 system&mdash;and the publicity around it&mdash;it sometimes leads to improved levels of compliance for a short while, but then it falls away again. We have evidence that there continues to be a steady flow of residents who have failed to export purchases made under the X3 system and that the intensified auditing has not had a lasting effect in preventing this from taking place.

In Melbourne, prosecution action has been taken against 17 Australian travellers. In Brisbane, 20 per cent of travellers in one random audit had either not exported the goods or had not declared the goods for Customs purposes on returning to Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not have that information before me. But if non-compliance of 50 per cent of a random sample is thrown up, that tends to indicate a substantial problem. It would not have been two people of whom one was found not to have complied. In Adelaide, travellers interviewed on returning to Australia admitted to not having exported goods purchased under the X3 system and, in fact, having been advised by vendors that export was not necessary. So the anecdotal evidence is right, but none of us is going to change the law on the basis of anecdotal evidence. But it does cause one concern that it is so widespread and that people are always talking about the system being rorted. From time to time articles appear purporting to confirm that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, none of us is going to change the law on the basis of mere anecdotal evidence or concern, but there is currently no mechanism, other than random checks of travellers at airports, to ensure that these goods are actually exported. Random checks are a very expensive way of doing it. It relies on successful prosecutions and the publicity associated with it. It causes difficulty at airports because there are two separate systems operating. The prosecution is sometimes a bit heavy-handed. Random checks often effectively turn up first offenders who have committed some minor offence and who would not normally be subject to the rigours of the courts for such a minor offence, although they would, of course, have to pay the tax. So if we do not apply that sort of punitive action, then we do not have the deterrent effect. So it is a system that is being abused. I have some other examples here, but I do not want to take the whole night. The audit activity tends to confirm the fears of those of us who have been hearing the anecdotal evidence about abuse. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am surprised that the Government has acted so speedily following this random sales tax audit. In other areas the Australian Taxation Office has used the medium of prosecution to provide a sufficient deterrent to avoidance and evasion, the sorts of problems that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) referred to. This sort of knee-jerk reaction so soon after an audit gives me some concern. This sort of arrangement, the X3 arrangement, is not dissimilar to what is used by primary producers in this country. Undoubtedly, an audit of certain primary producers could show that a number of them probably falsely claim. I would hope that, as a result of a random audit in that case, we do not lose that valuable exemption that can apply in a primary production area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that the figures are so high, this is a matter of some concern. But I would have hoped that we could have had further time to see the results of the successful prosecution policy that was organised and to see whether there had been a substantial reduction. However, if, according to the evidence, 50 per cent of that sample&mdash;if it were a genuine sample&mdash;were found not to have complied, obviously that is a matter of some concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come to my second question. But before that, I would have thought that perhaps some processes could have been put in place which would have actually tightened the existing process to overcome the difficulty that the random audit threw up. Knee-jerk reaction from the Tax Office is always a problem because it adds substantially to the volume of tax law. Unfortunately, the losers in this game are essentially the honest people who have to comply and lose this X3 benefit, which is very valuable. I submit that over 50 per cent of the sales of many retailers around the capital cities are involved in the X3 arrangement. In this time of recession it will be a substantial reduction of income&mdash;new income&mdash;to this country, because it is essentially for people going abroad. </PARA>

What guarantee is there that the particular company that collects the money, Duty Free Securities Co. Ltd, will continue to offer the docket plucking system on an ongoing basis? If we remove that facility, the whole thing will collapse so far as the duty free stores are concerned. I believe it is relevant for the Senate to ask the Parliamentary Secretary: will the Government give an assurance that this company, in the light of the withdrawal of the X3, will continue to provide that service? I believe that it is necessary to ask that question and to continue that service if we are going to provide this sort of facility to people who have been travelling overseas. </PARA>

That should be ample protection.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But at the end of the day, if the assurances that we have been given are not fulfilled by this company, this company at the end of the day is dependent upon the cooperation of the FAC to continue to discharge its operation which is fundamental to the successful activities of the duty free operators in their primary function.

When I say a reasonable price, I mean a price of $500 to $600, for example, which has presently been quoted. Does the Government feel that it has a role to ensure that that price is maintained?

Of course, the extent to which those 3,200 stores are significantly affected by this varies. Some are affected a lot, some a little. But, yes, it is a large industry and, yes, they generally consider that it is adverse. Some of them, at least, have suggested that it could cost $10,000 to join the system.

There have been two separate Australian Federal Police raids, from which possible prosecutions are pending, where shop assistants have signed the X3 certificate on behalf of customers who have had no knowledge at all of the requirement to export the goods. We have had a successful prosecution in Western Australia and some evidence of more sustained activity where shop assistants and/or proprietors have added goods to the bottom of invoices after purchasers have left the store; shop assistants have then purchased goods at tax-free prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In these debates we all must be careful that we do not smear a lot of honest people. The overwhelming majority of people working in these industries and managing these businesses are honest people. When giving examples we must ensure that people do not run off and say, `The industry is full of crooks'. No-one is contending that and certainly, in the very few instances where I have been making such purchases, it has been done in accordance with the law. So certainly the majority are clearly honest citizens. I just want to make that qualification because, when we start laying out a series of concerns, it can easily lead to misapprehension about the industry as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We even had a successful prosecution against an individual who was habitually purchasing goods by obtaining an overseas air ticket, purchasing goods tax free and then getting a refund on the ticket. This particular person was not only doing that on a regular basis but also then advertising the goods through the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Trading Post</EMPHASIS> and selling them. This was a tax avoidance-driven business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is a source of serious concern. The alternative arguments are not without merit. But the sorts of experiences that I have exampled have led the Government, after a couple of years of examination, to conclude that we had to act on this matter. </PARA>

But when the body about which we are speaking is further removed, it is beyond my capacity to give someone a guarantee.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My advice&mdash;it is logical, and I was not aware of it before&mdash;is that a similar system operates in the customs law. There, the obligation to pay the government remains with the store owners but they enter into contractual arrangements with the customers. It is their practice that, to make the purchase, the customers have to enter into a contract with the store owners, so that if they act in such a way that duty becomes payable, the obligation is with the customers, not the stores. It is not the law that prescribes that. The law has a relationship, as one would normally expect, between the store owners and customs, but there has developed a framework of contracts which would be capable of straightforward extension and operation in this circumstance.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill as originally drafted included various elements of design in relation to the manufacture and development of goods. That was a matter of serious concern to the Design Institute of Australia and others who were involved in the design side of the production chain, particularly for manufactured goods. The way in which the Bill was originally drafted brought in design, which in many ways can legitimately be regarded as a service. It extended the wholesale sales tax at least to that service and, therefore, moved away from the underlying principle of the wholesale sales tax&mdash;that it is a sales tax on goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand it, the amendment that the Government has now introduced overcomes that problem. I would seek some comment from Senator McMullan in relation to this matter. My query arises from the press statement of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) dated 11 August which foreshadowed these amendments. As far as external costs were concerned, the press statement said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bills seek to bring into the sales tax base product design and development costs incurred by persons who are past the traditional wholesale taxing point (e.g. where design costs are incurred by a retailer who contracts out the manufacture of the goods). While there is general public recognition of the need to tax these costs, a number of practical difficulties in applying the new provisions have been identified. In the light of these concerns, the Government has decided that the full external costs provision should not be proceeded with at this time in order to allow a further examination of the issues identified. However, the proposed external costs arrangements will continue to apply to royalty payments, except that liability will be limited to the value of the royalty payment.</PARA>
<PARA>I am not seeking to comment on that latter part in relation to royalties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a continuing uncertainty in relation to the proposed treatment of design and development costs, but particularly design, in the wording of the Treasurer's statement of 11 August. This matter was considered in some detail by the Select Committee, which noted in paragraph 29 of its report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the comments by Senator McMullan that there is not at this time any intention to introduce further legislation to change that situation.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter was left uncertain in the Treasurer's statement. The possibility of further changes was foreshadowed because the statement said that the reason the Government was not going to proceed at this stage was simply `to allow a further examination of the issues identified'. That is an unsatisfactory way in which to leave it. I hope Senator McMullan might be able to give those who are legitimately concerned about this some assurance as to the future intent of the Government. I hope that the future intent will be that the Government will not proceed along the lines that it had included in its original Bill, and that the decision not to proceed will be a permanent decision. I hope we are not just in a holding situation pending, to use the Treasurer's words, further examination. </PARA>

I cannot go beyond what I said on that occasion. The Government and the Treasurer have said that there is general public recognition of the need to tax these goods. Given that that is our view, it would be wrong for us to say, `But we are never going to do anything about it'. What I can say is that this decision not to proceed is not a temporary matter. It is not just for the next few days or weeks or months.

I remind Senator McMullan of some words which I thought he might have felt comforting at the time when he addressed the Senate Select Committee on Sales Tax Legislation in relation to the general anti-avoidance provisions.

I also ask&mdash;because these are related questions&mdash;have the concerns with regard to ordinary commercial arrangements been drawn to the attention of the Treasurer as well as to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan), and will there be a statement in the House or the Senate to confirm or clarify the operations of the general anti-avoidance provisions in relation to normal commercial dealings?</PARA>

It was a great speech, but not everybody was listening. I say again what I said then about the general anti-avoidance provision. This goes to some of Senator Watson's concerns. It may not cover them all, and I will see what else there may be that he needs to have answered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been asked, as Senator Watson says, to clarify whether the general anti-avoidance provision will apply to ordinary commercial arrangements. The answer is that it will not. However, as these words are inexact in legal terms, and their scope is uncertain, the new provision, like its counterpart in the income tax law, is designed to apply where, on an objective view of the particular arrangement and its surrounding circumstances, it would be concluded that the arrangement was entered into for the sole or dominant purpose of obtaining a tax benefit. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps I may add a second tier of complication. I thank Senator McMullan. That was a helpful and reassuring response which the sales tax community will appreciate. Is it not the case that the second example of a scheme is, in fact, a normal commercial dealing? For example, I refer to the practice of a business choosing to pay an advance lump sum for industrial property rights. Such lump sums are commonly paid for both the cinema and video rights to a film. How can this be a scheme when the exhibition of a film in a cinema is not subject to sales tax and the arrangement applied also to video rights before videos became taxable? I think it is desirable that these normal commercial dealings be brought within the ambit of the general anti-avoidance provisions.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the advance payment related to a royalty or something that was not defined as goods and, therefore, to which the wholesale sales tax did not apply, of course there would be no avoidance by definition. If it was an advance payment that led to sales tax not having to be paid in circumstances where, otherwise, it would have been, and there were no other circumstances to indicate that the arrangement had been entered into for other purposes, then one would have thought that on the face of it there was some implication.</PARA></TALK.START>

I thank the Parliamentary Secretary for his assurance, but point out to the Senate that it probably would have been more helpful to have had that within the provisions of that exhaustive list.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the points of real concern that were expressed about the original Bills and the general anti-avoidance provisions have been picked up in the amendments. In particular, the amendments will clarify the circumstances in which the general anti-avoidance provisions will apply; that is very important. I also believe that there has been a considerable improvement made by virtue of changing the definition of `dominant purpose' to refer to a purpose which is dominant against all the other purposes combined. The original Bills had the definition of `dominant purpose' as just the most important or the largest single purpose, even though that purpose may have been only 5 per cent or less of the total purposes. That is a highly desirable change. It is a matter of concern that it was not defined that way right from the outset. </PARA>

<PARA>I am sure Senator McMullan is well aware, as we are on this side of the chamber, that that drafting has caused a great deal of concern. It is positively Orwellian in its tones. It gives the Commissioner an enormous exercise of power of interpretation to be able to determine that particular things are to be treated as not having happened, or that particular things are to be treated as having been done by a different person or to have happened at a different time, and that particular things that did not actually happen are to be treated as having happened. They are extraordinarily wide terms to have in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the extent that the legislation has been amended to include the range of criteria that the Commissioner has to take into account, it is argued that that does provide some offset to the Orwellian nature of that drafting, but the fact is that that drafting, which was violently opposed by a very wide range of witnesses and which attracted a great deal of attention from a wide range of organisations, particularly in the business world when it was first published and became known, is still there. I believe that that is a matter of considerable concern. </PARA>

We all realise that Taxation Commissioners have to have areas of discretion&mdash;there is no question about that&mdash;but this is a huge area of discretion. It is a matter of considerable concern. I would appreciate Senator McMullan explaining to the Committee why that is so; why that drafting has not changed; and also the earlier point that I made following Senator Watson's comment about why the exclusion of normal commercial transactions is not included in the Bill. </PARA>

I reinforce the point that it is also not included in part 4A of the Income Tax Act.

The Senate Select Committee recognised that as well. It made the very important point that the taxation laws should be such that businesses are able to operate in an efficient manner and still be entitled to the advantages of the broader business inputs exemptions, without having to structure themselves as companies in order to take those benefits when that structuring may well cut across the most efficient operations and structuring of the companies. The fact that that will be picked up is to be welcomed. I wanted to raise that point because I think we are all concerned about it&mdash;certainly, the coalition was concerned about it.

I think in the interests of disclosure I had to make that statement.

Publishers will need to be experts in sales tax law and copyright law and to conduct a detailed analysis of each article which is produced for inclusion in a newspaper or magazine. The fewer the divisions of labour, the greater the problem. The more efficient the use of equipment by shift work, the fewer the available exemptions and the greater the problems. For example, a senior editor or journalist who creates and finalises the process himself is denied an exemption, while equipment used to check and subedit the work of less efficient persons is exempt. That makes a mockery of this clever country. We are trying to introduce new technologies of which the newspaper industry is at the forefront, and here we have a sales tax impediment.

With regard to typesetting equipment used by publishers, why is it that manufacturers are entitled to exemption for equipment used in creating designs and formula for production as well as virtually all equipment used in planning and development while publishers are still denied exemption to certain typesetting equipment? There is no rationale for these sorts of distinctions in this day and age because the technology has changed, but the sales tax law has not been brought up to date to acknowledge that they should have equal treatment as they are essentially using the same processes and equipment.</PARA></TALK.START>

Equipment used in servicing cars, buses or transport vehicles is not exempt. The maintenance of equipment used is very important in a lot of other industries, but it is not consistent with the whole fundamental framework of the legislation to provide this exemption.

<PARA>Amendment 7 proposes to insert a new exemption provision into the law to remove the 15 per cent sales tax which applies to electrically powered vehicles. The intention of it is unashamedly to promote the purchase and use of electrically powered vehicles. We have talked about this in the past. Because it is so late, I will not go over all the obvious reasons why we should be promoting this. It is another sensible alternative which is future oriented, and we should be doing something about it. </PARA>

We argue that this would lead to savings across the economy, especially in the area of energy. That is all I need to say at the moment on these two amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At this time of the night I shall be very brief. On behalf of the coalition, I want to indicate that we will be voting against all of these Bills. We will only call one division, but we will be opposing each of the Bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly the Bills, as now amended, are an improvement on the Bills that were first introduced into the Parliament and guillotined through the House of Representatives. A similar attempt was made to guillotine them through here. It should be noted that the Bills are better now than they were because of the action of the Senate in establishing a select committee, which did at least give some scope for their examination. As a result, some of the worst features of the Bills have been changed or removed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bills remain totally objectionable to the Liberal and National parties. The sales tax regime is nothing more than a hidden consumption tax which takes from taxpayers without their knowing some $10 billion a year. That sum has more than trebled in the nine years of Labor government. I find it quite ironic that the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), in introducing his new tax legislation today, said that in doing so the Keating Labor Government would not be introducing a broadly based consumption tax. All I can say to the people of Australia is that they should not believe that. The wholesale sales tax is a consumption tax. It is a hidden consumption tax. The actions of this Government in its approach to policy making and, particularly, government spending would necessitate, if it were to remain in government&mdash;thank God it will not be&mdash;its introduction of a broadly based consumption tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amended legislation remains poisoned with the anomalies and inconsistencies that are inherent in a wholesale sales tax regime of this nature. The Bills remain profoundly hostile to business. Many important matters which were dealt with in the 150 submissions that the Select Committee on the Sales Tax Legislation received have not been considered either by that Committee or by the Senate and I believe that the legislation still contains inherent defects which, as I have said, a tax regime of this nature can never wash out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This exercise has been much more than a simplification exercise.`Simplification' is a total misnomer for it. There have been some major policy changes. There have been significant extensions of coverage of the sales tax regime. It has not been a simplification procedure because one cannot simplify legislation of this nature unless one tackles the multi-rate structure and the whole question of exemptions and classifications. Neither of those has been attempted to be tackled in the Government's so-called simplification exercise. Indeed, we have had the extraordinary situation both at the Select Committee stage and tonight of the Government admitting its awareness of anomalies and of its having said equally openly that it is not going to take action to remove or correct those anomalies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, this is a hidden consumption tax. It is being extended by stealth. It is being extended overtly as well in this legislation. There remain inherent problems with the Government's wholesale sales tax regime. There is no way that a tax of this nature can have the inherent difficulties and problems with it corrected. One obvious example&mdash;there are many others&mdash;is that it is a tax which automatically cascades into the cost structure, thereby increasing the costs of doing business and of manufacturing and producing goods and services in this nation of hours at a time when we need to be more productive and more cost competitive. This works against the interests of those basic objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why the next government of this country&mdash;a Hewson coalition government&mdash;will abolish the wholesale sales tax and replace it with a goods and services tax, bringing the indirect taxation system of this nation into line with the rest of the developed world and with the needs of a nation such as ours that desperately needs growth and development. The taxation needs are for a fair and equitable, simple,  efficient and certain indirect tax regime. That is what a goods and services tax can produce for this country. That is something that a wholesale sales tax regime will never be able to achieve, no matter how much we may tinker with it. For that reason the coalition will be opposing these Bills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the deliberations of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act on its report, which is now in a draft stage, the Committee came to the conclusion that the report would be inadequate and incomplete if the report did not address the question of the funding of the Family Court of Australia. Whilst the funding of the Court was not one of the terms of reference given to the Committee when it was established in March last year, many of the submissions received by the Committee did address this matter and there is an acceptance that funding levels may impact upon the ability of the Family Court to undertake its statutory functions. The effectiveness of the present expenditure by the Court is also raised in many submissions.</PARA></TALK.START>

That arrest caused some concern around the world.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">1 September 1992, Chinese government arrested Mr Shen Tong, the first student leader in Tiananmen Square who returned to China.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy President, it is appropriate that this message be conveyed to the Australian Parliament because the events taking place in China and in particular the human rights situation there are relevant to us as it is highly likely that the Australian Government will decide that Chinese students will be required to return to China unless they can demonstrate genuine refugee criteria to enable them to stay. In that context, the treatment that the Chinese Government has dished out in recent days to dissidents who have chosen to return to China is a relevant factor. I hope that the Australian Government will take this case and similar cases into consideration when making decisions on the status of Chinese refugees who may be required to return to that country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The meeting on 27 February 1992 referred to by the honourable senator was held to discuss issues raised in various submissions received by the Tax Office in response to its draft ruling on interest rate swaps (EDR45) with a view to reaching some finality on the ruling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Matters discussed included the point of time at which obligations arose under commonly used swap documentation, the technical merits of the due and payable/due and receivable basis of tax accounting for swaps expressed in EDR 45 (compared with argument that relevant case law would support an accruals basis for some categories of business taxpayers), and the appropriate date of application of final ruling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2 and 3) At the meeting of 27 February 1992, industry and professional representatives expressed some misgivings about the view that, under the most common swap contracts, swap receipts are derived and swap payments are incurred for tax purposes at the beginning of each relevant calculation period. Their concern was that such a view was not consistent with tax accounting practices adopted in either the banking and finance industry or the non-finance corporate sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since this question was raised by the honourable senator the final Ruling, IT 2682, has been issued by the Commissioner.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This view was arrived at by the ATO after further detailed analysis of the most common documentation under which interest rate swaps are written, taking into account the various submissions received in response to EDR45 and the application of the relevant case law.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Is the Minister aware that in the Taxation Laws Amendment Act 1992 there is a possible unintended consequence of Section 14 of the Act which purports: `to ensure that there is not an unintended mismatch of expenditure on stock intended to be used as trading stock and income derived in relation to the disposal of the stock before the stock becomes trading stock on hand', that this apparent unintended consequence occurs in the case of a primary producer whose activities involved breeding cattle or producing crops, and that the outcome of those activities results in `trading stock' because of the definition of that term in section 6 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Does the Minister agree that it is unintended and unfair that expenditure relevant to these activities will now have to be claimed not in the year of expenditure but in the year in which the livestock or crops come into the primary producers' financial calculations.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1), (2) and (3)</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commissioner of Taxation has advised me that, in his opinion, subsection 51 (2A) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 can apply only to expenditure on the acquisition of stock that is expected to come on hand as trading stock of the taxpayer but has not come on hand by the end of the year of income. Expenditure by a primary producer on the purchase of, for example, fertilizer, fuel, seed for crops or the semen or embryos used in animal breeding is not in that category. The Commissioner does not consider that the words "will become" are used in the subsection to describe the process by which, for example, seed acquired for planting grows into a crop ready for harvesting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, the crop produced or the animal bred, while typically trading stock, would not, in the Commissioner's opinion, have been "acquired" with the expenditure in question. Such resulting trading stock would have been produced, not acquired. The terms "acquired" and "produced" are both used in the definition of "trading stock" in section 6 of the Act and the Commissioner considers that, in the related context of subsection 51(2A), the meaning of the term "acquired" does not include produced or, for that matter, manufactured.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commissioner intends making a public ruling on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I do not, therefore, agree that the provision requires amendment, I note that the amendment suggested in the honourable senator's question would have the result that forward purchase contracts of the kind at which subsection 51 (2A) is specifically directed (explanatory memorandum, page 105) would be taken outside the provision if the contract was for the purchase of livestock. The Government could not accept that outcome.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Laos Sugar Mill project was financed by  International Development Association (IDA) credits. Australia's contributions to IDA form part of a multilaterally financed pool, in which funds are not differentiated according to their source. It is therefore not possible to say whether particular contributions were used to support particular projects. IDA funds are allocated at the direction of the Board of the World Bank which is vested with the authority to determine the conditions on which any loan is made.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After Batstone had won the tender, the Government of Laos requested AIDAB to fund a program of technical training associated with sugar production. This training program, valued at approximately $200,000, and funded by AIDAB on a grant basis, was conducted in Australia between August and November 1988 by the Batstone Company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In July 1988, the Government of Laos requested further technical assistance and specialist inputs for the sugar industry. AIDAB agreed to fund a feasibility study which examined the production and processing of sugar at the Pak Sap operation, and an assessment of the technical assistance, equipment and other inputs necessary to ensure its viability and sustainability. The cost of the study was approximately $31,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Australia supports the Asian Development Fund (ADF) which allows the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to lend highly concessional funds to the poorer developing member countries of the Bank in the Asia Pacific region, including Laos PDR. It also supports the IDA which enables the World Bank to lend on highly concessional terms to poorer countries, including in the Asian region and to Laos PDR. Contributions to both IDA and the ADF are untied and provided on a grant basis. The main functions of IDA and the ADF are to foster economic and social development in developing countries. These are major Australian aid objectives.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(g) Loans by international development banks to which Australia subscribes (the World Bank, the ADB and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development) sometimes assist in the privatisation of public organisations as a means of encouraging economic growth. The conditions of those loans, like other loans, are determined by the respective boards of directors. Australia's representatives on the Boards are expected to judge such loans on their merit in accordance with the charters of the banks. The DIFF program is aimed at assisting Australian exporters to compete in the sale of capital equipment and related services in certain developing country markets. Ownership of the organisations purchasing Australian equipment or services financed by DIFF may be public or private.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) A number of actions are being addressed by the Government to encourage the more efficient use of fuel in the transport sector as one of the measures for lowering greenhouse gas emissions. Following on from the release of the Ecologically Sustainable Development (ESD) reports in November 1991, the National Greenhouse Steering Committee (a Commonwealth-State officials group) released in June 1992 the Draft National Greenhouse Response Strategy (NGRS) Discussion Paper. The Discussion Paper canvasses a range of measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including in relation to the transport sector (pp. 36-46). These measures cover both government and private transport. Following a period of public consultation and further development, the Strategy is to be presented to Heads of Government for endorsement at the end of 1992.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Yes. The connection between fuel price and fuel usage is well documented. For example, the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics Occasional Paper 103 of 1991 `Demand Forecasts and Demand Elasticities for Australian Transport Fuels' showed that fuel consumption would rise with a drop in fuel prices. A 10% drop in fuel prices would give rise to a 6.6% increase in petrol consumption and a 5.5% increase in diesel consumption. Increased fuel consumption resulting from an increase in vehicle usage would lead to additional greenhouse gas emissions as well as air pollutants, traffic noise, and congestion.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Federal Government will contribute $30 million to the cost of the project. This is part of an $89 million project to improve the rail connection to the Port of Brisbane, including terminal facilities at the Port. I understand that the remaining funds will be provided by National Rail ($10 million), Queensland Rail ($19 million) and the Port of Brisbane Authority ($30 million).</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) I am aware that there has been concern that the proposed rail link will lead to increased noise problems. I understand that the Draft Impact Assessment Study prepared by the Queensland Government has found that opposition from residents has largely been based on concern over existing rail noise together with fears of increased noise because of the proposed standard gauge link. However, the Study has found that the proposed standard gauge traffic will, by itself, cause a relatively small noise impact. Freight traffic on the narrow gauge track is the major cause of complaint against the existing rail line. I under-</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">stand this traffic will continue to grow whether or not the standard gauge project proceeds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Study recommends a number of measures to reduce noise as well as a design study for specific noise barriers. The Queensland Minister for Transport, the Hon D J Hamill MLA, has advised me that he has endorsed these recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Study notes that the State School referred to is currently affected by rail noise from existing narrow gauge operations. The main impact is from intrastate freight trains, which produce maximum noise levels of up to 90 dBA. Construction of the new line will allow greater freedom to schedule these narrow gauge freight trains in daytime because existing constraints due to scheduling of passenger services will not apply. The Study indicates that it is this increased number of daytime freight movements, rather than additional standard gauge traffic, which may exacerbate the situation and make relocation of the school an option worthy of consideration.</PARA>
