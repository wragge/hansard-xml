<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) Act 1982. The amendments will give effect to the Government's decision to extend the life of ACIAR, to broaden its mandate, to change the constitution and membership of its governing bodies, and to address four administrative issues which will further increase its efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ACIAR is a small statutory authority which promotes and assists collaborative research between Australian and developing country institutions on problems of mutual concern. This collaborative research is aimed at development of sustainable agricultural systems and the design of appropriate natural resource management strategies. ACIAR's activities form part of Australia's aid program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is in a unique position to provide such assistance because of its environmental and agricultural diversity and the high level of expertise of our scientists. Australia is the only developed country located in the tropics and subtropics, and many of our scientists are working on problems very similar to those in much of the developing world. Because of these similarities, benefits from ACIAR's work flow to Australia as well as to developing countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, when ACIAR was established ten years ago there was some uncertainty over whether Australia's initiative to establish a special-purpose statutory authority which would mobilise Australian agricultural research expertise to help developing countries solve their own problems and improve their own research capacity should be an enduring feature of the aid program. As a result, the ACIAR Act 1982 contains sunset provisions which limit the life of the Centre to twelve years unless, following review, amending legislation is introduced by the Government. Earlier this year, following a Ministerial referral, a comprehensive inquiry was undertaken by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade to examine ACIAR's effectiveness and the desirability of its continuation. This was followed by the sunset review, as required by the Act, which drew heavily on the findings of the Joint Committee's inquiry. The Government has considered the sunset review report, and arrangements have been made for that report and the Government Response to the Joint Committee Inquiry report to be tabled.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agricultural development is a key element of economic and social growth in developing countries and ultimately serves Australia's own economic interests because that growth fuels demand for agricultural and other products from trading nations such as Australia. Improved farming technology is the basic engine of growth in low income, substantially rural, developing countries. Numerous studies have shown that investments in agricultural research generate very large returns, and these returns, coupled with the way the benefits flow to those in poverty, make investment in agricultural research extremely good aid indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Using a broad definition of agriculture, ACIAR has developed comprehensive but low-cost programs in crop and animal sciences, forestry, postharvest technology, plant nutrition, soil and water management and land use, economics and farming systems, and fisheries. There have been some outstanding successes. Examples include the successful biological control of salvinia water weed in Sri Lanka. This project rid Sri Lankan reservoirs and water courses of a choking mat of salvinia water fern, the world's worst water weed, using insects that feed on it. It was built on earlier work by the CSIRO Division of Entomology which resulted in the spectacular clearing of the weed in Australia and Papua New Guinea. Beneficiaries are rice farmers and fishermen and their families, hydro-electricity authorities, and rural people generally because of reduced spread of disease by mosquitoes. Independent assessment indicated a likely economic benefit to Sri Lanka over 25 years of $25 million&mdash;a benefit to cost ratio of 32 to 1. ACIAR is enabling the CSIRO team to release the controlling agent, a beetle, in Malaysia, the Philippines, Fiji, Kenya and Zambia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ambitious projects to control Newcastle disease, the world's most important viral disease of chickens, in village chicken populations in southern Asia using a heat-resistant vaccine are currently being concluded. Poor rural villagers throughout the world keep chickens to provide much needed protein and cash but frequent epidemics of Newcastle disease cause heavy losses in village chicken populations. Although Newcastle disease is not present in Australia, a mild variant of the virus exists here. This V4 strain causes no disease symptoms but does provide immunity against Newcastle disease. Veterinary scientists at the University of Queensland working with colleagues in Malaysia developed the idea that a heat-resistant strain of V4 could be developed and used as a vaccine which would not need to be kept in refrigeration. A first project proved this idea, and resulted in a vaccine coated onto chicken feed that could be conveniently fed to village chickens. A second project involved controlling  the disease across a whole state in Malaysia, and proving and adjusting the technology in five other South East Asian countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most severe disease threat to Australia's livestock industries is foot-and-mouth disease. ACIAR has promoted research to develop and prove the effectiveness of tests that can rapidly diagnose the presence of the disease and identify the strain of the virus causing the outbreak. This research involved teams of veterinarians from the Australian Animal Health Laboratory and the Department of Livestock Development in Thailand. The disease is endemic to northern Thailand and studies with the live virus there made it possible to refine a test and prove it in the field with actual outbreaks. Having the test available allows Thai veterinarians to quickly diagnose foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks and correctly identify the virus strain causing them. Cattle and buffalo can then be vaccinated with the correct vaccine. Rapid confirmation of false alarms or, should the worst happen, of foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks in Australia, would save the Australian livestock industries millions of dollars. For example, the tests enabled Australian scientists to diagnose a false alarm in Queensland in only 17 hours when a disease outbreak was suspected in 1988.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The final example relates to an excellent project on culturing giant clams for farming and restocking denuded tropical reefs. Giant clams became threatened after heavy poaching of tropical reefs in the 1960s and 1970s. Their meat is much sought after and forms part of the traditional diet of many Pacific island peoples. Work by James Cook University of North Queensland staff and colleagues in the Queensland Department of Primary Industries, the Philippines, Fiji, the Cook Islands, Kiribati, Tonga and Tuvalu resulted in the development of low-technology, on-land hatching technologies for artificial rearing of all seven known species of giant clam. Ocean culture techniques by which the clams can be grown to a commercially valuable size have also been developed. Nationally operated clam hatcheries are now operating in Australia, Fiji, Tonga, the Philippines and the Cook Islands. Apart from the benefits to villagers farming giant clams for traditional use and cash, denuded reefs can now be restocked for conservation purposes with locally extinct species.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no doubt that ACIAR has been outstandingly successful. It is lean, professional and efficient and has an excellent approach to its task. It has adopted a unique strategy of identifying developing country research priorities, of assessing the mutual benefit of projects to Australia and the developing country, and of matching these with relevant Australian expertise in the formation of carefully tailored collaborative research partnerships. The need for such programs now is even more compelling than at the time of ACIAR's establishment. While the driving force of agricultural innovation to increase per-hectare yields to feed burgeoning populations remains, the call for increased productivity is being counterbalanced by a call for sustainability. This requires a research-based effort to ensure high yields but without depleting land, water and marine resources irrevocably. Australia faces similar challenges to the developing world in this regard and will benefit from the ACIAR partnership mode.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, with the overwhelming evidence of the worth of ACIAR's activities drawn out from its review and elsewhere, the Government has decided that ACIAR and its work should continue, and the primary purpose of this Bill is to secure the Centre's future beyond its initial twelve-year life. However, in considering that fundamental issue the Government has also examined and endorsed three other recommendations which will extend ACIAR's mandate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No provision exists at present for ACIAR to engage in training activities, yet training is integral to the research projects ACIAR commissions, not only to enable their successful conduct, but at times there are also excellent opportunities for broader capacity-building training. Up until now, this deficiency has been overcome by AIDAB reserving a small part of its training resource for ACIAR. In the future, ACIAR will be able to conduct its own project-related training.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second matter relates to the implementation of results flowing from research projects. While the primary responsibility for the provision of resources necessary to ensure the transfer of technologies from ACIAR research projects into development programs remains with AIDAB, and AIDAB and ACIAR do maintain a regular dialogue on these matters, it is clear that there are occasions where it would be more appropriate for ACIAR to assess and commission a development activity independently. Accordingly, the Government has decided that ACIAR's functions should allow ACIAR to fund development activities when necessary to try to ensure adoption of the results of the research it commissions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The third matter relates to Australia's support for international agricultural research centres, primarily those of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research, but also other related centres and activities. The research conducted by the centres has been a driving force in expanding food production in developing countries. Most of the high-yielding varieties of rice, wheat and maize which have enabled the spectacular increases in production, commonly termed the "green revolution", were derived from varieties developed by two centres, the International Rice Research Institute and the Centre for Wheat and Maize Improvement. Australia has also been a substantial beneficiary. For example, around three-quarters of Australian wheat sown today comprises varieties derived from international research. The value of increased wheat productivity since the varieties were introduced in 1974 is conservatively estimated at $2 billion. Australia contributes to the work of the international centres through the aid program administered by AIDAB. ACIAR has developed close linkages with the centres and increasingly has been called on to provide technical and policy advice to assist in determining relative funding priorities and making sound decisions. With ACIAR's future assured, the Government has decided that responsibility for this important part of the aid program should become one of ACIAR's functions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, much of the success and relevance of ACIAR's activities can be attributed to the direction and influence of its two governing bodies, the Policy Advisory Council and Board of Management. The uniquely constituted council with its strong developing country representation has played a fundamental role in the evolution of the Centre's programs. Similarly, the Board of Management has provided strong strategic management direction to the Centre. Nevertheless, the Government considers that some changes to the composition and size of both bodies are warranted. The 19-member Council tends to be somewhat unwieldy in practice and hence it has been decided to reduce it in size to a maximum of 14 members. It has also been decided to allow more flexibility in its membership by removing the requirement for Australians to be in a majority, and to allow for senior, appropriately-qualified AIDAB officials to participate in the work of the Council, instead of necessarily the Director-General of AIDAB. Similarly, the Government considers that the Board of Management could be reduced to five members with the removal of the requirement for ex officio membership of the AIDAB Director-General. ACIAR maintains good informal links with AIDAB and consultations are held routinely on a variety of matters of mutual concern.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the remaining provisions of the Bill address four administrative issues aimed at increasing the efficiency of ACIAR.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first issue relates to the powers of delegation of the Director of the Centre. Section 41 of the ACIAR Act stipulates that the Centre shall not enter into any contract without the approval of the Minister. The Attorney-General's Department has interpreted the power of delegation to approve contracts as limited to a person in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, an inappropriate and impractical arrangement for a statutory authority which is independent of the Department. This limitation has been construed on the basis of comments in the second reading speech made by the Hon. Tony Street, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, in 1982.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ACIAR Act also limits the delegation of powers to `a person'. This prevents the delegation of powers to the Board of Management. The amendment Bill enables the Minister to delegate his powers to the Board of Management of ACIAR or to the Director or staff of the Centre.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The third issue relates to the banking of trust moneys. All moneys appropriated to ACIAR are paid into the ACIAR Trust Fund. The ACIAR Act also stipulates that all other moneys received by the Centre, other than trust moneys, are to be paid into the Trust Fund. As a consequence, any trust moneys received by the Centre cannot be banked into the Trust Fund, but must be banked into a separate bank account. This Bill amends the ACIAR Act to enable the Centre to bank trust moneys into the ACIAR Trust Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fourth issue concerns the financial reporting arrangements for the Centre. The Centre satisfies the criteria by which an organisation is deemed to be a department, and consequently is subject to the Financial Statements Guidelines. The ACIAR Act stipulates, however, that the Board shall prepare financial statements in such form as the Minister for Finance approves. The approved form is that set out in the Entities Guidelines. As a result, ACIAR currently prepares two sets of financial statements. This Bill eliminates this anomaly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill does not imply additional outlays although the Government is keen to see an increase in funding for ACIAR and the international agricultural research centres as budget circumstances permit. The administrative amendments to improve the efficiency of the Centre will reduce administrative overheads.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will come into force on Royal Assent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to honourable senators and present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The speech read as follows:</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the principal purpose of this Bill is to provide Australian citizens living on Norfolk Island the opportunity to vote in Federal elections.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposal flows from the Government's response to a recommendation from the House of Representatives Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee Inquiry into the Legal Regimes of the External Territories.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommended that Australian citizens living on Norfolk Island be given the right of optional enrolment for the purposes of representation in the Australian Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the decision to make the enrolment facility optional recognises that there are historical reasons which make Norfolk Island a unique case. It also recognises the basic democratic rights of those Australian citizens who do wish to vote, but are currently denied the opportunity of doing so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As Honourable Senators would be aware, the Government's decision to adopt this recommendation and, in particular, the proposal to attach Norfolk Island to the Division of Canberra for electoral purposes, created some controversy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Legal advice available to the Government was that the Constitution would not permit the residents of an external Territory to vote in other than an electoral division of a mainland Territory. It was on this basis, and the advice of the Australian Electoral Commission, that the decision was taken to attach Norfolk Island to the Division of Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Norfolk Island Government is vigorously opposed to the attachment of the Island to any single mainland electorate as it is felt that this would lead to a loss of identity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am pleased to be able to inform the Senate that the legal and constitutional issues involved in this proposal have now been resolved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following intensive negotiations, agreement has been reached with the Norfolk Island Government as to the basis upon which eligible Norfolk Island residents will vote in future Federal elections.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The arrangement is based on the existing itinerant voter provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. The Bill provides that Norfolk Islanders who can establish a relevant connection with a State Subdivision can enrol in that Subdivision. Those who cannot establish such a connection may enrol in a particular Territory Division, currently the Division of Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will also amend the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984, consequential on the amendments to the Electoral Act, to allow those Norfolk Islanders who take up the option to enrol to participate in referendums as required by section 128 of the Constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I am pleased that this contentious issue has been resolved to the satisfaction of both Governments and that, in future, it will be possible for Australian citizens resident on Norfolk Island to exercise their full democratic rights, but in a manner which takes account of the unique historical circumstances of the Island.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also seeks to amend the Norfolk Island Act 1979 to change the reference to "travelling expenses", as used in section 56, to "travelling allowances".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 56 provides a mechanism for authorising the payment of travelling expenses to Judges of the Norfolk Island Supreme Court as may be approved by the Governor-General from time to time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The expression "travelling expenses" is somewhat narrower than the usual provisions dealing with travel-related entitlements. It has therefore been decided to amend the section to bring it more into line with the wording of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976, which refers to "travelling allowances".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The opportunity has also been taken to validate past payments of travelling expenses purportedly made under that section.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prior to 25 July 1991, the Governor-General had not approved the rate at which such expenses were to be paid. The practice was to pay visiting Judges travel-related entitlements in accordance with the relevant Remuneration Tribunal Determination applying to them as Judges of the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, Judges travel to Norfolk Island in their capacity as Judges of the Supreme Court, not of the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As these past payments were technically unauthorised, but were made and received in good faith, it is appropriate that they be validated by legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Financial Impact</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Norfolk Island Government operates its own fiscus from which it meets the cost of travel-related entitlements for visiting Judges. The electoral provisions of the Bill will have a negligible effect on Commonwealth revenues and expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the Explanatory Memorandum to this Bill.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c)assist plaintiffs in the discharge of the burden of proof.</PARA>
<PARA>This is to do with a matter which arose in the last session concerning the way in which Australian society should move the cost of an injury occasioned by a defective product in our society. In other words, where, because a manufacturer has put into the marketplace a product which is defective and that defect causes some bodily injury or some damage to a person, the Senate has already agreed that there should be a new way in which liability can be ascertained and, therefore, a new way in which compensation can be obtained by the injured party from the manufacturer&mdash;a new way, that is, supplementing the traditional ways of seeking damages by way of the law of negligence or under contract law as modified by statute over the last century or so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This product liability legislation was a controversial matter. Whilst the Bill itself as presented to the Senate received the assent, I think, largely of all those involved in the then proceedings, three matters were excluded from the Bill which had been in the Bill in some of the original drafts. I indicated that I believed that those matters could be well sent to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I argued in relation to extraterritoriality, which is a means by which overseas consumers could sue Australian manufacturers over defective products; and the period of repose, which is a mechanism by which the provisions of the Bill would not attach to the consequences of a product causing damage where that product had been put in the marketplace more than 10 years before. Also, a provision dealing with the way in which a plaintiff might be assisted to bring the claim before the court and get a fair hearing&mdash;get the day in court in relation to a particular matter&mdash;with the burden of proof always remaining on the plaintiff, on the balance of probabilities, to demonstrate that the defect in the product did in fact cause the injury. Nevertheless, it was thought in some earlier drafts that there might be a way of assisting the plaintiff to have the benefit of inferences that might be drawn from circumstantial evidence and so on to enable the person&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that; good point. This would enable the person to be assisted in getting the matter truly before the court&mdash;that it is a live issue for the court's adjudication. These are fairly technical matters, but nevertheless they have very important consequences for the viability of the manufacturing sector in Australia. That has to be balanced with the rights of consumers to ensure that they are not injured by defective products and have no effective form of redress.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I shall elaborate a little on those three issues. As to extraterritoriality, I have to confess that, in a sense, it was simply because the product liability provisions were placed within the Trade Practices Act that the extraterritorial operation of that Act was attracted. Almost without a definite intention on the part of the Government, the particular operation of the Act brought about a situation where it would be open to a person in a foreign country who suffered injury as a result of a defective Australian export to seek to recover damages from the manufacturer of that product in an Australian court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there are good arguments for that to be the case. We should not be in a situation in Australia where the dumping on overseas markets of products that otherwise would not be safely marketed in Australia is encouraged. Already the Trade Practices Act prohibits the exporting, without ministerial consent, of goods that have been banned under the Act. So already there is a policy stance sanctioned by this Parliament with which the provision I originally had in the Bill would harmonise. But I think it is a matter that requires further consideration in order to get the balance right, and that is a matter that could well be looked at by a Senate committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`Period of repose' is a technical and unusual term. Basically, it means that there is a protection for manufacturers built into what we might call the parent model of this legislation, the European directive. It will be recalled that the Government, in seeking to renew the law relating to product liability in this country, was not attracted to certain proposals put by the Australian Law Reform Commission; nor did it feel that it was simply a matter of hoping that the law of negligence might be better implemented and modified by judicial reflection on the way in which loss should be apportioned in our society where a person is injured by a defective product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The European directive, which governs, obviously, European Community countries and which looks like being adopted in northern Asian countries such as Japan and Korea, provided a model. Within that it is provided that this particular imposition of liability regime would not apply to a good which was put into the marketplace more than 10 years before the cause of action arose. In some earlier drafts of the Bill I took the view that 10 years was probably too short a time. I did so because, when one looks at the product liability cases of some notoriety over the last several years&mdash;claims against manufacturers in relation to the Dalkon shield and the Copper 7 IUDs and the asbestosis and diazepan cases&mdash;they all involved chronic long term effects which were manifested more than 10 years after the product was put into the marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought, therefore, that 20 years was a reasonable period. I am not talking about statute of limitations but statute of repose; it is a slightly different concept. I believe that, under the proposal I put forward, it was reasonable to say that the fact that a good was, say, 11 or 14 years old when it caused the damage should not debar the plaintiff from seeking to take advantage of this new product liability regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was considerable concern expressed in the manufacturing sector in Australia, and the pharmaceutical industry in particular, about this provision, for very obvious reasons. When I was in the United States I talked with industry about the product liability regime, if it can be called that, that operates in that country. It is in absolute chaos. I do not know why a manufacturer would want to establish a manufacturing plant in the United States and put products into the marketplace there. The court regime is run by trial lawyers and the product liability regime is absolutely hostile to manufacturers in its operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the Bills that have been introduced into the House of Representatives and the Senate, largely as a result of lobbying of manufacturers, include a repose period of 25 years for capital goods only and have no repose period for those which cause toxic harm. So what I was proposing was in no way radical. I hope that the American experience might be of interest to the Committee and that it might have a look at the drafts when it considers the matter. In any case, as Senator Alston, Senator Hill and Senator Spindler would know&mdash;I am not sure about Senator Macdonald&mdash;there is no statute of repose in relation to contract or tort. We also need to take that into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third matter relates to the question of the burden of proof. What I tried to do in some earlier drafts&mdash;and Senator Alston indicated this in an interjection a little earlier&mdash;was build into the provision in the Bill some indication to the Australian courts that in looking at this matter they should give more weight to, and be more robust in the application of, the res ipsa loquitur principle; that it should not really be a very anaemic shadow of the rule as it is applied in the English courts in relation to negligence where in fact the English judges apply the principle of res ipsa loquitur, which means that a thing speaks for itself. There are certain circumstances where the plaintiff can take advantage of the obvious inference that must be drawn from an accident having occurred and relate the accident, the injury or the incident to a defect in the product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At least this is a starting point. Then we can have the toing and froing of the case being argued. In the end, the plaintiff must prove on the balance of probabilities that the injury was caused by the defect in the goods. But the point is that the res ipsa loquitur principle is not strongly weighted in the minds of Australian judicial benches and in that situation I was trying to assist them to give the weight that they ought to give. That did cause great controversy and it may well be that some of the drafts that I put forward were not as eloquently put together as they might have been. Therefore, once again, I thought that ought to be withdrawn from the Bill as presented to the Senate in the latter stages of last session. Nevertheless, this matter ought to be properly considered by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that those three matters ought to be sent to the Committee. I hope that its workload will allow it to consider these matters when it finally concludes its report on the cost of justice&mdash;a mammoth undertaking which has taken several years of work. I hope that it will have an opportunity to examine this product liability matter. I hope that the various arguments can be put&mdash;and I  believe this to be crucially important&mdash;on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record in open discussion before the Senate Committee rather than by way of various lobby groups exercising hidden power in the corridors. When I was Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs I was accused by some of being beholden to certain consumer lobby groups. Of course, it is alleged that manufacturers put pressure on other relevant members of parliament. I prefer to see all this out in the open with the arguments being put fairly and squarely before a Senate committee which I believe will be able to reach a reasonable conclusion in relation to these three matters. That committee would then bring a report back to the Parliament and we would consider whether a legislative amendment is required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the motion to the Senate. In anticipation, I thank the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for taking on this very interesting, somewhat technical but, in the end, very important reference. It is important for the rights of those who are injured by defective products but also it is important for manufacturing industry in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition will oppose the reference of these matters to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. That is a somewhat unusual stance for us. Generally speaking, we would prefer matters, particularly matters of legal consequences such as this, to be referred when there are issues that might not be otherwise as well developed through the non-public mechanism of the Parliament. However, in this instance the issues have been debated in detail for a long time and, basically, a reasonable balance has been found to protect the interests of consumers in matters of product liability.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think everyone in this place accepts that there has to be reasonable protection for consumers, and perhaps at times in the past those protections have been inadequate. But most people also accept that there has to be a reasonable balance between the interests of consumers and manufacturers in this area, or the result is simply that our manufacturers are unable to compete with others in industrialised countries that also have well protected systems of law and protection. As we follow that argument, it develops into a failure of business in this country and a failure of jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This motion is only before the Senate today because Senator Tate lost the argument in his own Caucus. It is somewhat rare that the Labor Party Caucus demonstrates any element of commercial commonsense, but in this instance it recognised that Senator Tate was just going too far and answering to the consumer lobby in a way that was out of balance with what is necessary to enable manufacturing industry to proceed in this country, but, nevertheless, subject to reasonable protections for consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Tate decided as a one-off that he would continue to pursue his objective, and to do it by means of sending the matter to this Committee. We received a rather colourful press release from the Minister representing the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) advising us that he had vowed to continue his push. Despite the fact that Caucus had decided to remove these three provisions from the legislation that he was bringing to us towards the end of last session, he was going to continue with this mission and try the alternative mechanism of gaining parliamentary support for these three measures through a reference to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Madam Acting Deputy President, I remind you that the legislation passed through the chamber towards the end of last session. It considerably enhanced the protections and strength of consumers in relation to product liability cases. The Minister now wants to weigh the balance further in favour of the consumer to an extent that we think is totally unnecessary and, apparently, to an extent that his own Labor Party Caucus also thinks is unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, the Minister wants provisions written into Australian law that specifically give extraterritoriality&mdash;that is, the right for overseas consumers to sue Australian manufacturers over defective products. We see that as unnecessary. I use this occasion to say that we had some debate in the chamber as to whether the amendments the Minister was introducing to the Trade Practices Amendment Bill would have extraterritorial effect inadvertently. We produced advice from Clayton Utz and its counsel, Mr R.J. Ellicott, QC, to suggest that they may have that effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the other place, the now Minister for Consumer Affairs, Ms McHugh, read an opinion given by the Chief General Counsel, Mr Dennis Rose, which was basically in support of the argument put in this place by the Minister that they would not have that effect. Nevertheless, I draw Senator Tate's attention to what Mr Rose specifically said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is by no means entirely clear that section 75AD(c) would be limited to cases where the relevant injury was suffered in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Despite the Minister's undertakings&mdash;and I accept that they may well have some consequence in the interpretation of that legislation&mdash;there still seems to be an element of uncertainty on that matter. There is a good argument that the Government should have made clear, and still should make clear, in that legislation by amendment, the fact that it is not to have extraterritorial effect. That is by the way. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Tate" NAMEID="NJ4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suspect that the Australian Democrats will support the Minister in this reference to the Committee. The Democrats are not well known to take into account the commercial consequences of legislation and, therefore, the Committee may well look at that issue as well. We do not see the justification for giving this extraterritorial effect in relation to product liability and do not see any reason at all why it needs to be further debated within the committee system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue that Senator Tate is concerned with is the period of repose; that is, for how long can complainants bring action and make their complaint. Senator Tate believes that that should be for a period of up to 20 years. As I said, these matters are a question of balance and we think that on balance that is totally unreasonable. It simply does not take into account commercial reality. What has been put in the legislation is a period of 10 years, and that strikes us as a balance that is not unreasonable. In fact, one can imagine manufacturers even being concerned by that length of time, because they have to plan their business to take into account consequences that could flow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, we obviously have a responsibility to consumers and 10 years is the figure that has been included; but to seek to extend it to 20 years is totally unrealistic and totally fails to appreciate and reflect any sort of reasonable business understanding. There is no reason, in our view, why that needs to be debated further within a parliamentary committee either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third area that Senator Tate is pursuing in one way or another is really an attempt to switch the onus of proof. I do not know whether he adopted this colourful expression of the `Aussie battler' provision, but he certainly utilises it within his press releases as demonstrating the spirit of what he is seeking. What we are supposed to interpret from that is that in some ways the Aussie battler is disadvantaged unless the onus of proof is on the manufacturer instead of on the claimant. Although the use of such an expression is now obviously designed to strike an emotive cord, it really amounts to a switch in the onus of proof. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not think that is justified also. The person who brings the claim must be prepared to make out that claim, and that protection is enshrined within common law to try to find a fair balance between those who bring actions and those who have to defend them. We do not really see any reason in that instance why the Committee's time should be taken up with an examination of Senator Tate's so-called `Aussie battler' provision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In normal circumstances we are more than happy to support references to Senate committees where useful outcomes might result from their deliberations. However, in this instance we are simply left with a frolic of Senator Tate's which in some ways is a relic of his period as Minister for Consumer Affairs. I think he somewhat regrets that that responsibility has been taken from him. When one thumbs through the series of press releases that he put out during that period, one understands that he certainly saw himself in the role of a knight in shining armour going forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I in no way reflect upon Senator Tate's motives, I really think he lacks an element of commercial reality. I say that in a sense of goodwill. I understand what Senator Tate was seeking to do during his period as Minister, but even his own Party recognises that there has to be some commercial commonsense in these matters. For him to seek to take it further yet again, having lost the portfolio, through means of this Senate Committee, is in my view simply a waste of the time of the Committee, and in those circumstances we are not prepared to support it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats regret very much the necessity for this referral to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. As has been expressed before by our then spokesperson, Senator Powell, the Democrats would have liked that Bill to remain intact under the onslaught of industry lobbyists and in light of the Government's somewhat weak-kneed reaction to that particular lobbying effort. The Bill could have remained intact because the numbers were there. Let us put that on the table. If the Government had wanted to pass the Bill with these provisions intact, it could have because the Democrats were perfectly willing to support it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons we would have supported it is the obvious responsibility of Australian manufacturers to users and consumers of their products. The three areas taken by the Minister into the reference are essential elements of that particular orientation. Why should there not be extraterritorial application if a user buys an Australian product in good faith? Why should a manufacturer escape responsibility if the time period elongates because the effects of the product defect do not become readily clear or cannot be detected as in many of the cases we have been dealing with historically? For instance, in the case of asbestos and some of the medical products, the damage and effects were not known until decades after people used them. So why should a manufacturer escape liability?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third item which causes us great concern is the fact that manufacturers could escape liability simply because ordinary people&mdash;yes, Aussie battlers, Senator Hill&mdash;simply lack the financial power, the wealth, that these days is necessary to get into court. In our court system at the moment the legal costs that are attendant upon retaining lawyers practising in our courts are such that only the very rich or the very poor, if they qualify for the ever diminishing criteria for legal aid, can afford to take legal action. So it is necessary to enable these people to take action. I speak on that particular topic with a degree of feeling because of the cost of justice evidence that is now before the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee to which this particular matter is being referred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another matter that needs to be raised. Apart from the need to even the balance between the manufacturer and his or her battery of lawyers on the one hand and the consumer on the other, I believe the Bill has been painted wrongly as being anti-business. I believe that business that sent its lobbyists into action was mistaken. If we are to be competitive in world markets, if we are to build up a viable export industry, we need manufacturers and we need products which are produced to the highest quality standards. In fact, the reputation that we can build by doing that will be of benefit not only to the community, not only to the consumer, but also to the manufacturer because we will be able to establish a reputation for quality, for consistency and for taking responsibility if something does go wrong, which will mean that consumers here and in other countries will buy our products with confidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is rather a pity that business has chosen to hide behind technical legal protection when it should be concerned about building up its capacity and reputation for responsibility in not only producing the highest quality products but also standing behind them readily and responsibly. From that point of view, I believe that the Bill, as it stood originally, was sound from both the consumer's point of view and the manufacturer's point of view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I regret very much that the Minister for Justice, Senator Tate, has apparently been rolled in Cabinet, as it has been so colourfully stated by Senator Hill. I believe that the Minister is to be commended for the way in which he is pursuing the substance of the Bill as it originally was. The Australian Democrats will certainly support the reference to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, although we regret that that reference is necessary. As I said, we would much rather have passed the Bill intact. It was very much a second best Bill that was passed by the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We certainly support this reference to the Committee. As a member of that Committee, I look forward to the investigation that it will undertake into this particular matter.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just a moment. Senator Spindler made the facile and fatuous statement that somehow you have to be rich or poor, and now he is saying, `Well, even if the others can get a deal, maybe that's not the best approach'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other real difficulty, which Senator Spindler seems to be unable or unwilling to comprehend, is when someone comes along 40 years after the event and says, `I once served my country on the Kokoda Trail. It was pretty rough going so I used to smoke a bit in those days. Here I am at the age of 78 and I have suddenly discovered that I have lung cancer and it is all the fault of the Australian Army'. It is very difficult in many circumstances to establish the link. The link is not established on some emotional basis that somehow the person is a patriot who deserves recompense. It is established through the social security system or various other mechanisms. Veterans affairs provisions provide compensation of various sorts. But the person does not come along to the courts, throw himself at the mercy of a jury and say, `I really have great difficulty in proving that what I am now complaining of relates back to those days on the Kokoda Trail, but I want to put to you the Senator Tate principle that in all the circumstances of the case it is reasonable that I ought to get a whacking great pay-out. Despite the fact that it may be a windfall gain to my relatives because I have not got long to go, I want you to give me a very substantial award of damages, whether it is punitive or whether it is merely to make up for all the pain and suffering that I have incurred over the period'. In other words, it may have nothing do with the causative link and the person may have no prospects at all of proving his case. That is what litigation is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Tate gets up here and rings his hands virtuously and says, `We don't want consumerism gone mad, as I saw on my last trip to the US'. But that is precisely what he is proposing to import into this country. If he had a skerrick of responsibility and concern for consumers&mdash;who of course ultimately pick up the tab for these things by way of higher cost of products&mdash;he ought to be interested in ensuring that we compensate people as a matter of course for silicosis or pneumoconiosis or whatever else it might be through the welfare system. But people do not go through a big legal charade which eventually comes down to saying, `Because my injury is serious, I ought to get compensation'. That is what the Minister is doing by trying to do away with this link. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Put aside the general proposition that every judge in Australia somehow lacks the intestinal fortitude to apply the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. That principle has been around for very many years. Senator Tate well knows that it is open to every lawyer in the country to argue it as vigorously as possible and to persuade judges that they ought to follow their English brethren. If they do not, presumably there are good reasons why that is so. One can then appeal and argue that the High Court somehow is negligent in its duties if it does not properly apply the principle. That is not what I understand Senator Tate to be saying which is that, somehow, the end result in this country is not quite as good as it seems to be in the UK. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The solution to that may well lie in a number of areas, but it does not lie in artificially trying to change the onus of proof. In my experience, that doctrine has certainly served the process well because it does, to a considerable extent, ensure that one does not get swamped by those American approaches. If there is one thing we certainly do not want in this country, it is that form of litigation.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Minister says it is run by the trial lawyers; it is run by a legal system that has opened the door.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Medical negligence actions have nowhere near reached the stage that they are in America. The consequence is that we have premiums of $100,000, $200,000, $500,000 being paid by surgeons and that flows through directly to the cost of medicine. Then we will get the Senator Tates and the Brian Howes of this world getting up and saying, `Isn't it appalling. We certainly couldn't move to anything like the American system of health because it is far too expensive'. That is part of the reason why it is far too expensive&mdash;every man and his dog is terrified; when he sees an accident he crosses over to the other side of the road because he might not be insured and he might have applied the wrong bandaid.

You have to find in that way, but the bottom line is, is it reasonable?"'. Those opposite know that that is tantamount to saying, `If the injury is sufficient, give me compensation', and that is not what the courts are for at all. The courts are there to apply principles.

The right thing, so-called, is to ensure that we can safeguard the future of this particular individual who has been before us for the last week and who is obviously very deserving. We are not particularly concerned about the fact that it might add a cent or two to third party insurance premiums or the cost of products'. Of course, we fall for that every time.

To put it in context, as I said at the time of the passage of this legislation, it should not be necessary. Senator Spindler has made some comments on that already. Like Senator Alston, I too have looked at the press releases of the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate). I rise today, in particular, to refer to the Minister's press release of 7 May when he foreshadowed pushing ahead with the legislation and also this reference which is before us today. In that press release Senator Tate said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`. . . on the three issues opposed by business, I will have my day in court&mdash;or rather in committee&mdash;to argue for their inclusion'.</PARA>
<PARA>I am not a member of that committee at present, although I have been in the past. I am standing here to urge Senator Tate to do just that because he remains the vocal advocate on the Government side for the consumers in this matter and on this particular piece of legislation. The consumers of Australia are relying on Senator Tate to continue with his strong advocacy in this area. I look forward to reading the transcript of his evidence before this Committee. I encourage Senator Tate to follow that through and have his day in the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I have a concern about some of the comments that the Minister made in the second reading speech when the Trade Practices Amendment Bill, now Act, was introduced. I am not questioning his motivation in sending these crucial issues off to the Committee. In fact, he is to be commended, as he has been already in this debate by Senator Spindler, for not dumping Australian consumers in the face of a heavy business and industry lobby and for conceiving this approach. He will have the numbers to achieve it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned about the apparent implication that consumer groups and others with less power and force quite often in public debates are not treated equally unless they can get before a Senate committee. That is a matter of particular concern when we have an oppo-</PARA>
<PARA>sition here today determined to oppose, by its vote in this chamber, such a reference. One has to be extremely concerned about a political coalition in this context who may well be in government after the next election not being prepared to allow ordinary Australians, to allow those without the power of money behind them, to have their day in committee, let alone in court. I feel that is something that ought to be of concern in the political process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly concerned about the suggestion coming from Minister Tate that before the Australian Labor Party was in government the situation, at least in this case, was that consumer groups and individuals in the community were not able to raise their voices sufficiently other than in this context. However, the reference will pass the Senate and go ahead and be in the hands of an extremely competent committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make a comment or two on the Opposition's proposition that somehow or other to have strong consumer protection laws in this area&mdash;and as yet we do not, because the legislation that was passed was significantly defective&mdash;is to threaten the viability of Australian industry. The opposition to the extraterritorial claims, in particular, raises this question. Surely there ought not to be any suggestion at all that the viability of Australian industry should be dependent on the provision of anything less than full rights for consumers, wherever they live. Surely we do not want to build industry in this country that is dependent upon being able to fling its products out onto the world marketplace according to anything less than a regime in this country or anywhere else in the world that would protect the consumers of those products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So much for the Opposition's much trumpeted pursuit of excellence in Australian industry. So much for its commitment to overseas competitiveness. What has happened to international best practice when it comes to consumer law? I do not see how the Opposition's position will in any way  enhance the reputation of Australian industry&mdash;far from it. It is the case that around the world these sorts of laws are being passed and quite often they are strong laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a disappointment to me that, when the Bill was before us previously, the Minister took a different position on the question of the burden of proof from that perhaps previously canvassed by the Government and certainly by the Law Reform Commission and was forced to take the EC directive model. To my mind, that was a less protective approach, unless we take the approach which is taken by a number of EC countries, including the United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, France and Italy, where claimants have other advantages, some of which the Minister has referred to already. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important for this Parliament that the issue of the burden of proof is very closely looked at, that we put the interests of consumers where they rightly ought to be&mdash;in perspective&mdash;and that we do not fall for the furphy about the viability of Australian industry. I do not think anybody really wants to fall for that one; our international reputation could only be damaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So while the Act as we now have it is, in my mind, considerably defective, as the Minister said at the time, Australian consumers had already waited five years or more for some additional protection.

I hope that we do not have an election later this year because with the reporting date of 5 November, I think it is, and then time needed for legislation I would be extremely concerned if this issue were not dealt with in the life of this Government, given the incredible approach of the Opposition on this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to support Senator Hill's remarks in opposing the reference and to support the remarks made by my colleague Senator Alston, who dealt very effectively with the woolly thinking&mdash;which is the only way I can describe this press release&mdash;of Senator Tate. I think we need to look at this reference in the light of the history of this Bill. The first proposition that was brought to this Parliament was that we should have absolute strict liability. That is, if someone was injured by a good, then there was naturally assumed to be a defect in the good and the manufacturer was liable. There was no defence. The only thing you could plead was mitigation as to how much you paid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government was forced ultimately to have an economic impact study as to the economic impact that the legislation would have upon Australian industry. When we finally observed the result of that, we saw that it would have been devastating. We looked at the situation in the United States where, not by legislation but by common law practice, a strict liability system had been introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Alston outlined the situation as it applies to medical practitioners. But, of course, there is the well known example of an entire industry that went out of business in the United States forever, and that was the industry that manufactured light aeroplanes. That industry went out of existence because of the strict liability principle: if an aeroplane flew into a mountain, there was a presumption of a defect in that aeroplane. Furthermore, under that principle the argument could be extended to say that some of the screws that held bits and pieces together were also defective. The whole industry collapsed. Other examples can be found&mdash;and I would suggest that Senator Powell take a look at them&mdash;as to the way in which the cost of the manufacture of goods and the cost to the consumer is increased by placing undue burdens on the manufacturing sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Law Reform Commission report contained a statement that this was actually an ideological stance; that manufacturers who make things in order to be able to make profits ought to bear in the cost of that manufacture a payment to anybody who may suffer injury at some stage. In other words, it was a transfer on ideological grounds of the social welfare net onto the manufacturing sector. It was an absolute nonsense&mdash;and that is finally what the economic impact statement said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we came to the watered-down provision. We took a look at the European directive or, more particularly, at the German-pushed European directive. When the United Kingdom introduced its version of product liability legislation pursuant to the European directive, it provided for a state-of-the-art defence. That simply says that a manufacturer has produced the goods to the absolute best state of the art in the world; that they are up to best practice in the world. But under Senator Tate's idea and Senator Powell's idea, the top standard of excellence is simply not enough; they impute that somebody was negligent or in error and that a fault existed whereas in fact it was the best state-of-the-art manufacture at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The European Commission came back and said to the British Parliament, `Your legislation will not do; you are not following the directive and if you, the British Parliament, do not change your legislation'&mdash;and I think the period was three months&mdash;`then we will take you to the European Court of Justice'. So within the European Community we had two standards of the product liability standard to be followed. Germany followed the tougher standard, and when I had discussions with people in Germany about how they lived with it their answer was that they were a rich country and they could afford it. With the absorption of East Germany, they may have to reconsider that attitude. </PARA>

<PARA>What Senator Tate is trying to achieve, on my reading of the rest of his press release as well, is a strict liability provision by legislation because, he says, our judges are wimps and do not use the res ipsa loquitur principle to the degree to which the British courts do.

Very simply, Senator Tate cannot have it both ways.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;There has been a certain amount of hysteria on the other side. I certainly take offence at being charged by Senator Bishop with being involved in some gratification of a personal fetish in relation to this matter. The fact is that I am simply seeking to put before a Senate committee the sorts of matters that have been the subject of debate this morning. There is no reason why Opposition senators who are members of that committee cannot be persuaded or not persuaded by the sorts of arguments that have been put to us this morning from all sides of the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is very important to state&mdash;although Senator Bishop seems to have missed this&mdash;that the Senate and, therefore, the Parliament, has already indicated that it believes that the laws of negligence, tort law, common law and contract law, are not adequate and need to be supplemented. The Senate and the Parliament have already agreed that there should be a supplementary product liability regime based on the European directive, which relates to the Italian compensation for injury caused by defective products. Obviously, this applies in the major trading areas of Europe. It seems that this will be applied in the northern Asian countries, which are very formidable trading entities. It will never be adopted in the United States because of the total chaos of that country's legal and political systems in dealing with this matter, to the great detriment of manufacturers and employment&mdash;the employment of all but lawyers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has no intention whatsoever of departing from the major principle of liability in this Bill, which is that the plaintiff should prove all the elements of the situation&mdash;the injury, the defect and the causal link&mdash;on the balance of probabilities. It is not a subterfuge or some sort of camouflage for a strict liability regime. It is absolutely apparent and utter nonsense to say that it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The European directive takes effect within the various European countries according to their own rules of procedure and evidence. In the United Kingdom it is most likely that when cases come to court the United Kingdom courts will apply the European directive, given their understanding of the rules of evidence, such as the res ipsa loquitur principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was simply trying to indicate, not by way of a press release but in the various drafts that were produced early last year, how that principle might be put into statutory terms. In the end, that was deleted from the Bill that was presented to the chamber. I believe that there are some good working drafts that can be considered by the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. I look forward to the Committee's deliberations on this matter. I hope that they will be fruitful and that they will strike the right balance between the rights of consumers and the need to keep a vibrant manufacturing sector in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition will support the passage of the Crimes (Ships and Fixed Platforms) Bill 1992, which will enable Australia to become a party to two international instruments relating to the prevention of maritime terrorism: the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against Maritime Navigation and the Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against Fixed Platforms Located on the Continental Shelf. The convention and the protocol, made in Rome in March 1988, came into force on 1 March this year. This Bill will make the changes to our domestic law necessary for Australia to become a party to them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is, of course, Commonwealth and State legislation in place relating to crimes at sea, which in effect means that the criminal law of a State will apply to an act committed at sea, provided that the offender, the ship or the territory in which the act was committed has some connection with the State. There is, however, no legislation specifically dealing with crimes on fixed platforms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In essence, this Bill creates offences as required by the convention and the protocol in relation to acts likely to endanger the safe navigation of a ship or the safety of an ocean drilling platform. Division 1 of part 2 of the Bill creates offences relating to ships, as required by the convention. These offences include several for which the maximum penalty is life imprisonment, such as hijacking a private ship, destroying a ship, or causing damage to a ship or its cargo knowing that it is likely to endanger the safe navigation of a ship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of other offences have a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment. Such offences include performing an act of violence against a person on board a private ship where the offender knows that the act is likely to endanger the safe navigation of the ship; placing destructive devices on a ship; destroying or damaging navigational facilities; and knowingly endangering the safe navigation of a ship by communicating false information. Causing death or injury to a person in connection with the commission of any of these offences is also an offence, as is threatening to endanger a ship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 18 of the Bill sets out the circumstances in which this Act will apply. It will not apply to purely domestic offences; there must be an international element. The basic rule is that proceedings must not be commenced unless the ship is on an international voyage or in the territorial sea of a foreign country at the time the alleged offence is committed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The alleged offence must also have an Australian element or a convention state element. `Australian element' is defined in subclause 18(3) as being where the ship is Australian or the alleged offender is Australian. `Convention state element' is defined as being where the ship is flying the flag of the convention state or is in the territorial waters of a convention state; where the alleged offender is a national of a convention state or where a national of the convention state was seized, threatened, injured or killed during the commission of the alleged offence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Division 2 of part 2 of the Bill sets out the powers of a ship's master. They include the power to arrest and hold in custody any person whom they reasonably believe to have committed an offence under division 1, and to deliver that person to the appropriate authorities of any convention state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 3 of the Bill provides for a similar range of offences in relation to fixed platforms as required by the protocol. For the purposes of this Bill the fixed platform must be outside the Australian territorial sea and there must also be an Australian or a protocol state element. Such an element would be present if the platform is on the Australian continental shelf, or the offender is an Australian, or another state party to the protocol would have jurisdiction under the protocol. Pursuant to Clause 30 of the Bill, the written consent of the Attorney-General is required for the prosecution of an offence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Madam Acting Deputy President, as I noted earlier, the coalition will support the passage of this Bill. In fact, there is only one specific matter that I want to draw to the Minister's attention. That concerns the drafting of clause 12 of the Bill which provides:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A person must not destroy or seriously damage maritime navigational facilities or seriously interfere with their operation if that act is likely to endanger the safe navigation of a private ship.</PARA>
<PARA>Other clauses which provide for offences, such as clause 9 which prohibits the performing of acts of violence against a person on board a private ship, and clause 10 which prohibits the causing of damage to a private ship or its cargo, require that the offender knows that it is likely to endanger the safe navigation of the ship. Therefore, it seems that there is some discrepancy between these provisions in terms of the knowledge requirement. The Minister might like to address that apparent inconsistency when he responds in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from that minor point, I stress again the coalition's support for the Bill. We share the concerns expressed in the preamble to the convention about:</PARA>

The purpose of this Bill is to introduce a number of offences in relation to ships and fixed platforms which will fill an important gap which now exists in the present international regime to prevent and suppress maritime terrorism. It provides legal redress to nations affected by incidents such as the October 1985 hijacking of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Achille Lauro</EMPHASIS>, a matter to which I shall return shortly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the international importance of this legislation, the Australian Democrats will support this Bill. The legislation will enable Australia to become a party to the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against Maritime Navigation and the Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against Fixed Platforms, both of which were drafted in Rome in March 1988. Both the convention and the protocol were drafted as a direct response to the hijacking incident which highlighted various uncertainties about the legal position of the parties involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here there was a ship under an Italian flag, a hijacking which took place in Egyptian waters and the murdered victim was a United States citizen. In addition, there were several conventions dealing with specific acts of terrorism such as The Hague Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft and the convention against the taking of hostages. However, there was no convention dealing with maritime terrorism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main provisions of the Bill&mdash;all of which carry the maximum penalty of life imprisonment&mdash;are as follows:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill, unless the contrary intention appears, will have extraterritorial application to acts, matters and things outside Australia and to persons, whatever their nationality or citizenship.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;The Crimes (Ships and Fixed Platforms) Bill 1992 arises out of an incident which will be well known to honourable senators, the so-called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Achille Lauro</EMPHASIS> incident. The Senate will remember that in October 1985, Palestine Liberation Front terrorists took command of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Achille Lauro</EMPHASIS>, an Italian cruise ship, 10 nautical miles from the coast of Egypt. They held the ship's crew and passengers hostage and threatened to kill the passengers unless Israel released 50 Palestinian prisoners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 8 October 1985, when their demands were not met, the hijackers shot and killed a person of United States nationality. On 9 October 1985, the Egyptian Government granted the hijackers safe passage in return for the surrender of the passengers. There is no evidence, of course, that the Egyptian Government knew of the killing at that time. Subsequently, the US intercepted the Egyptian plane carrying the hijackers and forced it to land at a NATO air base in Sicily. Italy prosecuted most of the hostage takers, but allowed the head of the hostage takers to depart to Yugoslavia and tried him in absentia. That outcome was in part due to uncertainties about the legal position of the parties involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Achille Lauro</EMPHASIS> was a ship under an Italian flag, the hijacking took place in Egyptian waters and the murdered victim was a United States citizen. There was a very murky problem so far as international law and dealing with this particular atrocious act of terrorism was concerned. The world community, therefore, decided to promulgate a convention and a protocol dealing with the suppression of such unlawful acts of violence against shipping and certain fixed platforms, and the Bill before the Senate incorporates those particular principles into Australian law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the Senate&mdash;including both the Opposition and the Democrats&mdash;has indicated its support for the Bill. Of course, one would expect that view because of its concern to suppress, and deal with if suppression does not occur, acts of terrorism, particularly those which might occur in the sorts of circumstances which I have outlined. Even less dramatic incidents have to be guarded against, of course, and if they occur there has to be a legal regime which allows for the trial, conviction and imprisonment of those who have offended. This Bill provides for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Hill and Senator Spindler raised a particular matter which, on the face of it, does require some explanation. It appears that in division 1 of part 2 of the Crimes (Ships and Fixed Platforms) Bill before us, in relation to acts of violence or the offence dealing with destroying or damaging a ship, the offence requires not only that an act be undertaken which is an act of violence against a person on board a private ship, for example, but also that it has to be undertaken in the knowledge that the act is likely to endanger the safe navigation of the ship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That extra element is obviously put in so that this particular Act is not used to deal with what might be called simple assault in a dispute in the dining room or over cards on board the cruise liners. It has to be an act of violence which has that extra element that it is undertaken with the knowledge that it is likely to endanger the safe navigation of the ship. The same applies to causing damage to a private ship or its cargo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to destroying or damaging navigation facilities, it could be argued that simply to damage a maritime navigation facility or seriously to interfere with its operation carries the necessary inference that it will indeed endanger the safe navigation of a private ship, and the need to show an extra element of knowledge in the person accused is not required in that it is obviously a serious offence in itself to destroy or seriously damage maritime navigation facilities or seriously interfere with their operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The court has to ask itself whether indeed that activity would be likely to endanger the safe navigation of a private ship and the prosecution would have to indicate that that would be the case. But it is not thought by the drafters, apparently, that it is necessary for the prosecution to prove that extra element of knowledge in the accused. Nevertheless, I take the point raised by honourable senators, and, looking at the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation in schedule 1 to the Bill, I note that article 3 on page 13 of the Bill is headed:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any person commits an offence if that person unlawfully and intentionally:&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(d) destroys or seriously damages maritime navigational facilities or seriously interferes with their operation, if any such act is likely to endanger the safe navigation of a ship;</PARA>
<PARA>Whether that just means obviously acting with mens rea and in full possession of one's faculties or whether it requires a demonstration of that extra knowledge that is a feature of the elements of the offences in clauses 9 and 10 is a matter for further reflection. I suggest to the Senate it would be appropriate&mdash;and I am certainly proposing this&mdash;that the Bill be passed in its present form. If, on reflection on the matters raised by Senator Hill and Senator Spindler after the passage of this matter through the Senate and before it is considered in the House of Representatives, a further amendment is required, then I obviously give an undertaking that that will be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have asked the adviser whether in fact there is any comment by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee on this particular matter. I am advised that there is no comment that we are aware of. That is where this sort of thing is normally picked up if there is thought to be a problem, but it does not mean it is the only way in which it is picked up. Individual senators, of course, are right to raise a matter relating to knowledge in relation to the elements of an offence. Therefore, I give an undertaking that it will be looked at between this place and the other place and, if needs be, it will be dealt with there.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Sugar Cane Levy Amendment Bill 1992 facilitates the increase of the research and development levy from 10c to 15c maximum a tonne. The sugarcane levy was introduced in 1987 and has in the past been poorly supported, with growers providing only 6c a tonne, or about 0.17 per cent of annual gross value of production. We can compare this figure with that paid by other primary producers, such as meat and wool producers and wheat and oilseed growers, all of whom contribute 0.5 per cent. Cane growers have recognised that they want to increase the amount they pay by 8c a tonne to 14c a tonne.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government also provides primary industries with a dollar for dollar research and development grant up to 0.5 per cent of the gross value of production. The purpose of the levy is to provide a matching grant with the industry dollar for dollar, which the Government has also subsidised. Currently the maximum rate is 10c per tonne of cane, and this piece of legislation will increase the maximum rate to 15c per tonne. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The request for this amendment has come from the Australian Cane Growers Council, the Australian Cane Farmers Association and the Australian Sugar Milling Council. The funds raised through this levy support the activities of the Sugar Research and Development Corporation. The Commonwealth is committed to matching the Sugar Research and Development Corporation expenditure dollar for dollar, up to a limit of 0.5 per cent of gross value of production of sugarcane. The current 15c per tonne represents 0.29 per cent of the gross value of production, which is less than the 0.5 per cent limit which the Government will match. The Government estimates that its contribution for 1992-93 will be $3.15m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The importance of research and development cannot be overstated. Australian farmers are recognised throughout the world as leaders in efficiency and productivity. I have no doubt that there are lessons the sugar farmers could teach the manufacturing sector. The major productivity gains have been achieved through the purchase of modern machinery and improved agricultural techniques. Approximately 95 per cent of total Australian sugar production is based in Queensland. A further 5 per cent is produced in northern New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of widespread drought, the Australian cane harvest in 1991-92 was 23.1 million tonnes, the lowest harvest since 1979-80 and a fall of 15 per cent on the 1990-91 harvest. Sugar production fell by 400,000 tonnes from the 1991 harvest to 3.1 million tonnes. The value of sugar sales from the 1991-92 Australian crop declined by $255m to $949m. These figures reflect the severe plight of many sugarcane farmers right across the entire industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cane harvesting process has evolved from the days of cutting cane by hand to the mechanically driven machines operating today. To a certain extent, productivity gains in these areas have come as far as they are likely to in the near future. However, the Australian cane industry must not stop research to improve its product. Australia must maintain the competitive edge that distinguishes our product from the products of other countries. The way in which we achieve this competitive edge is through research and development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Much of this progress lies in genetic engineering, improved plant varieties, better sugar content, resistance to disease, resistance to drought and more efficient utilisation of water and soil nutrition, all of which add to greater efficiency gain.

At the time, both levies were described as having full industry support and we were assured that they were proposed with full industry support. But in those cases, as most honourable senators would know, we were later able to see that there was some doubt about the degree to which those who purported to represent the industry actually represented the industry.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also believe that more Federal Government support could be forthcoming for those developments which arise from research projects. Senator Tambling quite rightly listed the sorts of developments and the sorts of initiatives that bring a competitive edge to much of Australian agriculture as a result of research.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to take a couple of minutes to speak about improving the environmental sustainability of the sugar industry. Many recent initiatives are worthy of direct financial support by the community through its government.

There have been developments in its usage as a building material, as fuel, as an insulation material, and as fibre for paper. The Democrats believe that any step taken by processors to take advantage of these new uses should be encouraged and rewarded by government instead of the processors being left to speak for themselves. </PARA>

Recently I was fortunate enough to be a member of a parliamentary delegation to Brazil, where the many advantages of using alcohol as an alternative fuel for vehicles were demonstrated. They are obvious to anybody who travels to that place. Those advantages include reduced pollution, mechanical advantages, internal employment prospects, reduced reliance on overseas suppliers of petroleum, and the obvious foreign exchange benefits.</PARA></TALK.START>

Even further, farmers have benefited from further technological advantages. A good example of that was seen outside a research station near Brasilia. I saw a small, low cost, low scale, self-contained distillation plant which was able to use 11 hectares of sugarcane to provide all the fuel needs of an extensive mixed cropping and grazing property. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot get to that stage in Australia, even though we know it is technically feasible, because of the lack of government support, whether it be on the excise side or on the strictly legal side&mdash;whether one can have a still on one's own property. With those limitations, we have not been able to take advantage of the considerable advantages to both marketing and technology that derive from using alcohol as an alternative fuel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the benefit of those who are becoming a little impatient with my going on about that subject, I conclude with the observation that the simple and, in my opinion, misguided calculation of whether a fuel alcohol industry will be profitable, based on a simplistic comparison of the cost of oil-based fuels with the cost of production of fuel alcohol, is inadequate to provide our sugar industry with this other option. The significant community benefits must be recognised by the Government to justify government support for this initiative that the industry has been able to identify through research and should be empowered to initiate through further government support. That to me is justification for making my earlier claim that it is just not a case of encouraging the industry to levy itself to pay for further research. Rather, we are in need of a demonstration by government that support will be given for developments that are identified by that very research. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate today is debating the Sugar Cane Levy Amendment Bill 1992, which amends the Sugar Cane Levy Act by increasing the maximum of the levy paid by the sugarcane farmers and millers. I am very glad to see Senator Button here, because I believe that he needs all the help he can get on rural and primary industry matters. The increase in the levy was made at the request of the industry, which wished to see the maximum limit lifted to 15c a tonne so that a contribution of 5 per cent of the gross product value could be reached. This levy funds the activities of the new Sugar Research and Development Corporation, which last year spent $3.6m on sugar research and development.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Research and development is not a recent arrival to the sugar industry. Investment in research and development has played a major role in making the Australian raw sugar industry one of the most efficient sugar industries in the world&mdash;world leaders in crop production, harvesting, transport and marketing&mdash;and a major contributor to Australia's export earnings, on average around $1 billion a year. The levy proposed by this Bill is part of the Commonwealth Government's program to fund the Sugar Research and Development Corporation on the basis of industry-government dollar for dollar funding up to the value of 5 per cent of the gross value of production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1991-92, the maximum levy represented 29 per cent of the GDP. This year, the contribution will be $3.15m, equivalent to 12.6c a tonne. The new SRDC is funding invaluable research across the range of the industry: planting, harvesting, processing, handling, refining, farm extension work and pure scientific research. The sum of $3.6m was spent this year on research, despite funding of $8.6m being requested. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The importance of research and development is no new phenomenon to the sugar industry. The value of the industry investment in research and development has not been acknowledged all this decade. It is not widely understood in the community that the sugar industry spends in excess of $15m a year on research&mdash;about one per cent of the gross value of the industry output. On top of this expenditure, the milling companies also conduct their own research. This is done through three major research organisations and has been going on since 1900. The Bureau of Sugar Experiment Stations was established by the industry in that year. It now has an annual budget exceeding $9m, being mainly funded by growers and millers, with the Queensland Government kicking in one-tenth of the total cost. This research body has played a major role in developing cane species, researching and controlling pests, disease and quarantine and developing efficiencies in cane production and sugar milling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further to this, the milling industry has its own milling research organisation which has been operating since 1949&mdash;the Sugar Research Institute, or, as it is locally called in Mackay, the SRI. Unfortunately, poor seasons and returns have resulted in staff cuts of around 20 per cent, with a loss of valuable and highly skilled scientists. The Sugar Research and Development Corporation is funded by the levy under this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Madam Acting Deputy President, I do not have to remind you that the world sugar industry is the most corrupt of any agricultural industry. All major sugar producing countries provide price support for their producers, who all get some sort of guaranteed minimum price. All Australian producers are exposed to the world price, currently around 10c a pound. In the US the producer is guaranteed a market price of 26c a pound or $357 a tonne. In the European Community the guaranteed price is $551 a tonne and in Thailand it is around $447 a tonne. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By comparison, the Australian producer, exporting 80 per cent of his crop, received around $300 a tonne last year, which was well below the cost of production. The industry has also had to accept the imposition by the United States of quotas on sugar imports. Australian imports went from 800,000 tonnes before quotas were imposed in 1981 to 109,000 tonnes this year. Last year they were reduced further, resulting in a yearly loss of $18m, or $1,400 to $1,500 a tonne per farmer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Queensland produces 95 per cent of the national output while New South Wales produces 5 per cent of the total crop and, in turn, supplies 20 per cent of the domestic market. In both States the industry has introduced many reforms and efficiencies. Efficiencies have been gained through mill mergers, an automatic expansion rate of 5 per cent, and the adoption of practices such as trash blanketing, green harvesting and minimum tillage. Marketing practices, which are also receiving much promotion, are of great sophistication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our high quality Australian product is in enormous demand from international customers. They will buy only at world prices. Yet the Industry Commission, in its wisdom, has recommended that the Australian industry be totally deregulated. It has recommended that sugar communities from Mossman in Queensland to Maclean in New South Wales become guineapigs in its experiment in economic theory. I say to Senator Button, `When something is going well, don't fix it if it ain't broken'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the IC, untold expansion of the industry will occur and Australia will suddenly earn an extra $500 billion in sugar export earnings. I would like to meet the farmer who is going to go into the sugar industry and lose money just because he can get an assignment. Senator Macdonald will back me up in that statement. There are already 48,000 hectares of land out there on which sugarcane can be grown but no-one is silly enough to take it up. People know that, if they do, they will end up in very serious financial circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The IC even tells us that the environment will benefit. I do not know how it reaches that conclusion. The findings from the IC inquiry are that the main inefficiencies in the industry today are caused by production and marketing controls, yet past expansions in the industry have not been taken up. Presently, 48,000 hectares of cane assignment land are available for canegrowing, but who would sink money into buying, clearing and preparing the land, and paying outrageously high State water charges, to produce a crop that is sold at a price below the cost of production? Only the people in the IC down here in Canberra who have solved the economic problems of the world, the officers on $80,000 a year, would do that. If Senator Button has any say in it or can give directions to these people, I suggest that he gets them to spend two weeks on a sugarcane farm. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we talk about drought, it is also a topic that is relevant to the sugar industry. Some people think that, because the sugar industry is on the coast, it does not get droughts. Nothing could be further from the truth. Canegrowers, particularly in the Mackay area, this season have suffered an incredible drought. Mills in areas closer to Cairns, for example, the Mossman central mill, started crushing this year later than they had ever done in their history. Rainfall was insufficient and the growers wanted to give the crop a chance to get a little bit further ahead before they actually had to cut it, because they were concerned about the tonnage and concerned about the CCS they were going to get. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can do a lot of good work in research, in terms of trying to get a crop which, by virtue of the varieties grown or the practices used, is more resistant to dry weather. This is particularly relevant on the Atherton Tableland where you have the sugar industry&mdash;the Mosman Central Mill with the expansion of its mill area&mdash;going into old tobacco land, which is irrigated out of the Tinaroo Dam. There is a limit on how much land can be put under cane out of that irrigation area. One of the ways that we can improve the potential area for growing cane is by using, for example, trickle irrigation. This would reduce the amount of water that is necessary. It would also ensure that we can have more hectares and a guaranteed irrigation supply. Those are the sorts of things that we need to be working on. They are also the areas where, hopefully, we will see some improvement through research funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But let us make it perfectly clear: this Government cannot be allowed to welsh on funding of research in primary industry. Arguably, funding of research in primary industry, even at one per cent of the total value of an industry, is insufficient. For example, high technology private sector companies frequently put 5 per cent to 10 per cent of their turnover into research. Of course that is not possible now; the returns to farmers are bad enough as they are. Many of the returns are negative returns, as my colleague Senator Boswell knows full well.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The sugar industry is Australia's third most valuable export crop; 75 to 80 per cent of the total sugar crop is exported. Production in 1991-92 was 3.2 million tonnes of raw sugar, gained from a crop area of 21.3 million tonnes of sugar cane, with a gross value of production estimated at almost $600m. This Bill that we are discussing today proposes to increase the maximum rate of levy for sugarcane for research and development from its existing 10c per tonne of sugarcane to 15c per tonne of sugar cane. Of course, the Liberal and National parties support those proposals and support the requests from the sugar industry itself, from the canegrowers, from the Australian Cane Farmers Federation and from the millers, to increase that levy to add additional funding to research ways of improving the sugar industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government provides funding to match industry levies up to 0.5 per cent of the annual gross value of production, in line with established policy of encouraging increased rural productivity and profitability through research and the commercialisation of research findings. Although there is a cost to the Commonwealth in this, it is a cost which the Commonwealth can well afford. Over the years the sugar industry has been a major contributor to the wealth of this nation in very many ways, in the export earnings it has gained over very many years and, of course, in the sheer amount of income tax that growers have contributed to this nation over many decades. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were periods, going back some time now, when the sugar industry was very buoyant, when there were enormous amounts of money even coming out of the community that I live in&mdash;the Ayr, Home Hill and lower Burdekin area of the State of Queensland&mdash;where arguably the best sugar production in Australia takes place. So whilst there is a cost to the Commonwealth, it is a cost which the industry has paid for many times over in the financial benefit that the sugar industry has brought to this nation over many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sugar industry is committed to funded research and wishes to increase the commitment to the Commonwealth scheme through an increased levy in order to maintain its competitive export and domestic marketing position. The sugar industry is one that has a very long history of research and development, research and development that principally has been funded by the industry itself. I know that in the town I live in, in the lower Burdekin area, the Bureau of Sugar Experiments Stations has over many years done a lot of quite magnificent research into the sugar industry. That research, of course, has now put the sugar industry in the pre-eminent position that it is in as one of the most efficient, most technologically advanced industries, certainly in the sugar industry world, but in the area of rural crops altogether.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as the Bureau of Sugar Experiment Stations, which does a lot of good work in the many different sugar areas of Queensland, there is the Sugar Research Institute based in Mackay. It is another organisation which has done an enormous amount of very good, very technical, very beneficial research work over many years. This funding is going to the Sugar Research and Development Corporation. It will continue that sort of investment in research which will continue to keep the sugar industry in the position it is in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the years the sugar industry has looked at new varieties of sugarcane, quite different varieties that suit different areas, that suit different growing seasons, that get different types of sugar for different types of purposes. The industry has generally researched different growing regimes, pest control, fertilising and harvesting techniques. All those sorts of things have benefited enormously from the research that has gone into the sugar industry in past years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was a little concerned when my colleague Senator Bell from the Australian Democrats started talking about the sugar industry. As we all know, the Democrats want to increase the cost of fuel to farmers. They have all sorts of weird and wonderful ideas about most things in life, and when he started talking about sugar I thought he was going to say that we should ban firing sugarcane paddocks because it interferes with the ozone layer. But he did not quite get on to that ridiculousness, although I have heard it before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Lower Burdekin is a little different in that we still have such heavy tonnages of cane and the harvesting machines are unable to cope with them without the cane being burnt. The cane paddocks are set alight in every crushing season, which is just about now, and for a very short period the trash is burnt away from the cane stills, making it much easier to harvest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These ridiculous radical greenies have been running around saying, `That should not happen; it interferes with the ozone layer'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have an optimism for the sugar industry. There is a lot of expansion going on in the Herbert River and Burdekin areas of Queensland. The Burdekin Dam&mdash;an initiative of previous Liberal governments&mdash;has eventually been constructed and opened, and it has now opened up vast areas of land for the economical production of sugarcane in the future. Whilst there has been, as Senator Boswell said, some recent hesitation in the acquisition for the production of sugar of those blocks of land that are watered by the Burdekin Dam network, I confidently believe that in the years ahead the Lower Burdekin area and, in particular, the Herbert River area based on Ingham will become increasingly important as major producers of this very great export commodity we have in sugarcane. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other very important area, of course, in sugarcane growing at present is the Mackay region. That area is suffering enormously from drought, and there is need for a Burdekin Dam type proposal to quarantine the Mackay region against those sorts of droughts in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry continues to look at ways of improving its product. There was recently a trial at the Kalamia Sugar mill in Ayr whereby raw sugar was refined at the end of the mill. It was a very new technique&mdash;one that is still shrouded in much secrecy, I must say. If it comes to fruition and sugar mills around the State can be used to produce refined sugar at the end of their production run, that will be an enormous breakthrough and step forward for the sugar industry in Queensland. It is something on which a lot of research is still being done, and will continue to be done, by the sugar mills involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a lot of excitement in the sugar industry over the announcement by the Mackay Sugar Cooperative of a new refined sugar establishment in the Mackay area. Of course, we are expecting an announcement by CSR very shortly on the establishment of a major sugar refinery in the Townsville-Herbert River-Burdekin region of Queensland. That announcement, I understand, whether it is to be positive or negative, is due very shortly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposals that the Liberal and National parties have in their Fightback package for the sugar industry, and for all industries in Australia, are enormous. The slashing of costs will be of major benefit to the sugar industry. The National Farmers Federation's assessment of the effect of Fightback on rural production generally is very positive, as it must be when all of those costs that governments presently impose upon our export industries are removed. Of course, there are assessments that are in the area of between $6,000 and $9,000 of savings&mdash;</PARA>

Senator Short might have understood that if he had been listening to what had been taking place in the Senate over the last few months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Treasurer has said, if the Budget deficit in 1995-96&mdash;and that is, of course, three Budgets out&mdash;looks likely to come in at around 1 1/4 per cent of GDP, if necessary the Government would take remedial action to ensure that the actual deficit is smaller than that. That action would not involve new taxes. We are very confident that change to existing taxes, if it became necessary&mdash;and we do not believe that it would be&mdash;would raise the requisite revenue. Some areas of existing taxes have been identified.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are talking about in terms of reaching that required deficit figure is a possibility of changes to existing taxes to rectify a possible increase in the deficit of about $2 billion. We are not talking about the $27 billion which the GST would impose on the Australian people in terms of increased prices for food and clothing and all of the other commodities which are essential to daily family life, particularly of the poorer families in the Australian community.

I refer him to Budget Paper No. 1, page 4, point 40.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fact is that under the restructuring of Medicare that was announced last night, a very vital modification and revitalisation of Medicare will take place to change it from being simply concerned with health financing to a truly comprehensive health care program for all Australians. It has been most important to emphasise the role of public hospitals and the capacity of those hospitals to treat public patients.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a fact that some public hospitals have been tempted to take privately insured patients and we intend to create a situation where those who enter public hospitals do so based on absolute clinical need&mdash;on clinical assessment and clinical priorities&mdash;rather than on whether they happen to have private insurance. That is discriminatory against those ordinary public patients who have their Medicare cover but do not have private medical insurance. To give priority to those with such insurance must be regarded as discriminatory. It must be the case that the health care of Australians will be best advanced by saying that those who can occupy beds in public hospitals are those who have been clinically assessed as having a need to enter the hospital bed in that public hospital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will be providing a bonus of $1.23 billion over the next six years to those public hospitals which enter into these agreements&mdash;in a cooperative, collaborative agreement with the States and Territories, of course. In this way we will be able to ensure that public hospitals have the capacity to provide hospital treatment to those who are in need of it in the Australian community. This means that those who might be tempted to take out private hospital insurance because of a fear of not being able to get a bed in a public hospital will make the choice to do so as a true choice and not one based on fear of not being able to get a bed. They will be able to get a bed because of the incentives we will be offering to the public hospital system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear that this is a creative policy and one, as I say, which will revitalise the aims of Medicare to enable public hospitals to provide these services whereas, of course, the Opposition would decrease funding for public hospitals, transferring the funds across to subsidise private health insurance premiums. The Opposition recognises that there is a need to do that because the private health insurance premiums under its scheme will be set by the AMA and private hospital associations establishing the costs, and the private health insurance schemes will have to try to reach those excessive costs.</PARA>

Eight thousand tertiary students will cease to receive Austudy grants because of the increase in the minimum payment, and an additional 30,000 secondary students will also cease to receive the benefit. The minimum payment has been increased because, as concluded by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, small Austudy payments have little or no influence on individuals' decisions to participate in education and training, which is, after all, the purpose of Austudy.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tertiary students affected by this decision, along with others currently unable to receive Austudy because of parental incomes up to $50,000, will be eligible to receive a supplement of up to $2,000, repayable as per the other Austudy loan arrangements announced last night.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The age of independence has been reduced from the beginning of the year in which the student turns 25, at present, to the time at which the student turns 24 in 1993. This age progressively falls to 23 in 1994 and 22 in 1995. This puts the age of independence at one end of the scale on the same basis as the age of eligibility&mdash;16 years&mdash;at the other end. It represents a reduction for all. It is difficult to see how this can be portrayed, as it has in this question, as discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other major improvements to Austudy announced in the Budget are: an increase in the personal income threshold from $5,000, at present, to $6,000 next year; further, legislative entrenchment of the CPI indexation for Austudy payments; and the loan supplement under which tertiary Austudy recipients can trade in up to $2,000 of their grant for a loan of double that amount at zero real interest rate, repayable after five years through the tax system once the student reaches average weekly earnings.</PARA>

The age of independence would have fallen further if we had chosen to operate it from the beginning of the school year and not from the day of the birthday. Nonetheless, all those people do get a benefit. Putting it in terms of loss, it is only a loss against the benchmark that would have been had we stuck to the beginning of the school year date. That is the theoretical proposition. To put it in real terms, it is an improvement for all those people.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the first question is yes. The answer to the second question is that 800,000 new jobs will be created over four years as a consequence of this Budget. Unemployment will be around 10 per cent at the end of 1992-93, and at this time next year it will be below that figure. Spending of $1.2 billion on the employment package is a significant stimulus to job creation around Australia for meaningful work in jobs that will add to the value of assets in the community, particularly in regional Australia. This is, of course, on top of the moneys made available through the One Nation statement and the youth statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a Budget whose focus is jobs and more jobs. This is a Budget that achieves that objective by focusing on where unemployment is worst in Australia by region. It enables what local government has told this Government it is able to institute; that is, a program of capital works expansion in their regions, ready to go immediately. So the grants that come out to those regions will have a real and immediate effect of putting people into employment; they will add to the facilities and the community services within those regions; and they will stimulate in particular small business, which will be the major beneficiary of the contracts that will be let and of the employment generated in those areas too.</PARA>

We in this chamber have debated often the issues of youth unemployment. In one of those debates I went on the record as saying that no-one wishes to diminish the problems of the young unemployed, but that the group in the community which is worst affected is the older long term unemployed.

We are doing it without raising taxes, we are doing it without introducing labour market programs that have the effect of lowering wages, and we are doing it without scrapping the initiatives on training, which is the significant big initiative that enables this economy to have a highly skilled work force and thus become a more sophisticated manufacturing and service-provider economy in this, the most spectacularly growing area of the world.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security. I remind the Minister that in 1985, 18-, 19- and 20-year-old unemployed young Australians living with their parents received $88.20 a week in income support, an amount described by the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, in his Priority One youth statement as `inadequate'. I ask: why is it that in 1992, seven years later, unemployed 18-, 19- and 20-year-olds living with their parents now receive just $77.10 a week in income support, a decrease in absolute terms of $11.10 but of one-third in real terms with regard to purchasing power? Can the Minister explain how making 18-, 19- and 20-year-old unemployed people live on 13 per cent of average weekly earnings, or some $12.20 below the very austere Henderson poverty line, advances social justice? And why was not something done to provide a living income for these young adults in last night's Federal Budget?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of that commitment of this Government, I go back to the point that Senator Lees raised; that of course being support for children and&mdash;may I make it just a bit broader&mdash;support for families. It should be recognised by this place that this Government has had a long term commitment to the role of families in our community and support for such families. An important step towards fulfilling that commitment was the setting of benchmarks of adequacy, and they were set in 1989. When we introduced those benchmarks of adequacy for child payments, they increased family income support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence, we have continued to maintain the benchmarks set at that time&mdash;benchmarks which, as I say, are there to provide adequate family support. This Budget reinforces our commitment to those benchmarks.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It may be a long answer but there is a very full commitment that needs to be explained, particularly to people like Senator Kemp. It should be remembered that only a few weeks ago, in response to and coming out of the youth summit that was organised by the Prime Minister and this Government, a large number of initiatives were taken up by the Government in respect of the role of youth in our community. Those initiatives go to employment, they go to education and training and they go very much to the heart of income support for young people in this community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should also be recognised that not only have those outcomes come out of that summit but also that the Government has achieved massive community support for those initiatives.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not only have we achieved that, Senator Macdonald, from community groups; we have also achieved it from youth themselves. This Budget builds on that. It builds on a commitment to youth and also to alleviating the position of the unemployed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be recognised that this Budget allocates some $1.7 billion to creating jobs in our community over the next few years. Of course, that total builds on the $770m that was committed some few weeks ago to providing a program for young people in terms of education, training and employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I say to Senator Lees that we have had a commitment to youth in our community. It is a commitment that has been met by the achievement of fulfilling the benchmarks of adequacy that were set some years ago. This has once again been achieved in this Budget.

It is very difficult to make judgments about the facts of the matter on the basis of hearsay or second or third hand accounts. There are always two sides to these stories. There is a long and complex background to the people involved in this case. There was a question of disciplinary action arising in relation to the husband of the woman concerned. That is a matter in issue.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If it is your judgment that that is unparliamentary, Mr President, of course I withdraw, and I now do so. May I deal with the questions of process that Senator Bishop raised yesterday. Senator Bishop made much, it will be recalled, of the fact that informal mechanisms, informal processes, were being applied by my Department to deal with this matter at this stage. Senator Bishop made much, she said, of the non-existence anywhere in guidelines that she could find of the availability of these particular informal processes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">May I draw to her attention that informal mechanisms for handling complaints of sexual harassment are provided for in part 4 of the personnel management guidelines on eliminating sexual harassment, issued by the Public Service Commission for use in the Australian Public Service. Part 3 of that document does refer to mechanisms for dealing with or resolving cases of sexual harassment. I think it was that to which Senator Bishop was referring yesterday. What she did not do was acknowledge the existence of part 4 of this document&mdash;the very next part&mdash;which is headed and is all about informal mechanisms, including the informal mechanism of conciliation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The circumstances and the contents of this document make it perfectly clear that the processes that have been set in train by my Department are exactly appropriate and legitimate, and accepted and acknowledged as appropriate. In fact, 4.1 says that informal measures are the desirable way to resolve all but the more serious intransigent cases of sexual harassment, for a series of reasons which are then set out. Section 4.12 deals specifically with the question of an informal conciliation process and describes the way in which that operates. Might I draw to her attention and table the relevant extracts from those particular personnel management guidelines for Senator Bishop's edification. If she had any decency about her she would, of course, apologise for her assertions yesterday in the light of that documentation, but that is too much to ask, I acknowledge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other document I table is the extract from the departmental EEO program&mdash;a document no doubt hitherto unfamiliar to Senator Bishop. Certainly everything else about affirmative action and sexual equality in this country is. The relevant extracts from that I also now table. That deals with more specific mechanisms that are established within the Department, including the options of either going down the legal or criminal route, on the one hand, or the route of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and the Merit Protection and Review Agency on the other. There is also a middle stream procedure here set out and identified involving the contact of the workplace harassment contact officer for advice, and that was the course that was followed in this case. That is what is still being followed in this case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">May I repeat for the record and for Senator Bishop's edification that the complainant asked that the complaint be handled by these informal mechanisms. She has reconfirmed this preference in subsequent discussions. A deputy secretary of my Department, Mr Geoff Forrester, has been conducting an informal conciliation process, with the agreement of both the complainant and the other party. He has been assisted by two female members of the Department's workplace harassment contact group. This process has been conducted by the Department in strict observance of the principles of confidentiality set out in the Public Service Commission's guidelines in order to protect the privacy of both parties. I say again that it is a matter for concern that the details of this case found their way into the public arena and were exposed again yesterday by Senator Bishop's question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That informal process has not concluded. I am advised that the stage this particular matter has reached is that the departmental conciliator, after conducting a consultative process, has advised the complainant that he cannot bridge the gap in the accounts or the approach to this issue of the two parties and that a decision as to whether to request a formal investigation now rests with the complainant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It remains open to the complainant&mdash;she has been advised of this, as has always been the case, and she has been advised throughout&mdash;to lodge a formal grievance with the Secretary of the Department under the Public Service regulations, which is one option, or to go down the other routes I mentioned yesterday: the Merit Protection and Review Agency, a complaint to HREOC under the Sex Discrimination Act or, of course, the criminal process route. These matters are being handled by my Department in accordance with Public Service procedures. It would be quite inappropriate for me to intrude personally into that process other than to be kept informed from time to time as to its progress. That is exactly what happened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I am aware of the further point that was made by Senator Bishop yesterday that, in the event that a complainant might withdraw an allegation of sexual harassment, there are still obligations upon the Department to follow through the matter in various ways. They are set out in part 3.6 of the Public Service Commission's guidelines. We are fully aware of these provisions. Mr Forrester has had them in his mind throughout his conduct of the conciliation process.</PARA>

The first is: why did the Minister mislead the Senate by saying that conciliation and counselling are part of the informal process when the correct reading shows they are not? Secondly, were the grounds that the husband was sent back for so-called unsatisfactory work performance? Thirdly, if so, will the Minister tell us whether or not he can be satisfied that junior officers can feel confident that allegations they raise against heads of mission can be fairly and equitably dealt with without fear of reprisal? And, fourthly, will this Minister finally take responsibility for what happens in his Department as distinct from Burkegate, as distinct from the Marshall Islands affair, and now the Butler affair? Will he take responsibility for what happens in his Department, depart from his current practice and keep this Senate informed of what is happening in this matter?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In Question Time today, Senator Knowles asked me to table the advice given to Mr Burke by my Department in January 1989 that he had not made a sufficient case to buy a third duty-free car. I now do so. In doing so, may I indicate that this particular document was not one of those handed over in response to the FOI request from the Perth paper. That point is made in the newspaper article. The reason is that the document itself, the cable, could not be found in departmental files when the FOI request was being pursued. When the matter arose in the paper on Sunday, 16 August, Mr Forrester asked Dublin to search again for this particular cable. It has now been found in Dublin and provided to me and I cheerfully table it accordingly.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>In other words, it is not a substantive reference. It is, of course, the case&mdash;and it is acknowledged in the material that I put down yesterday&mdash;that there is no doubt that Mr Burke was aware of the existence of this particular administrative circular. Nor is there any doubt that he was aware of some of the content of it as it related to the purchase of a third vehicle.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Evans) in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Bishop this day, relating to an investigation of allegations of sexual harassment by a staff member of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</PARA>
<PARA>It was quite important that during Question Time today for the first time Senator Evans had obviously come across the document called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Eliminating Sexual Harassment</EMPHASIS>. Yesterday, before I asked the question in this place, my office rang his Department and asked whether it would forward to my office a copy of the guidelines by which his Department was bound in the way it would act on these matters. His Department forwarded to me two pages only of a workplace harassment statement which comes from the book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The EEO Program</EMPHASIS>. The significant page that was missing was that which says that one such sexual harassment was physical contact such as a frequent brushing against a person, pinching or patting or putting an arm around someone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The document I refer to now is a document that was not forwarded and which I had to get subsequently. The initial document that was sent across was the original document introduced by this Government in 1987, the provisions of which were virtually husbanded into this document. When we look at part 4, `Informal Mechanisms', we read the words Senator Evans used:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Informal measures are the desirable way to resolve all but the more serious intransigent cases of sexual harassments for the following reasons:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. they allow the case to be resolved without an individual necessarily being labelled as a sexual harasser . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. they focus on putting future working relationships onto a proper basis. . .</PARA>
<PARA>The mind boggles. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. management can institute awareness raising or preventative measures. . .</PARA>
<PARA>And on it goes. The most important thing it says, when it comes to conciliation and counselling, is that the principles of natural justice must be adhered to. It then specifically says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The person conducting the session should in the first instance seek advice from the Merit Protection and Review Agency or the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and then consult with the sexual harassment contact officer on the complainant's preferred outcome. The complainant should be given the opportunity to be accompanied to any session by the sexual harassment contact officer.</PARA>
<PARA>I asked the Minister yesterday whether he would outline for us precisely what action he had taken to ensure that the guidelines were implemented. In other words, I asked the Minister which officer&mdash;and I can only believe that it has become the Deputy Secretary, Mr Forrester&mdash;is in charge of this matter; whether or not contacts have been made with those other agencies; what steps have been taken to attest to the truth of the allegations as made by the complainant; and whether there would be an investigation of the sending of the husband home, allegedly on the basis of unsatisfactory work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I am doubly concerned about this case is that we have had another instance, in this Parliament, where a woman was subject to similar procedures. She got no justice at all for more than three years. I do not think the principles of natural justice should allow this woman to be under a cloud for that period of time. I do not appreciate the sniggers, the schoolboy humour, the keyhole type language used by the man who passes for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. It is unbecoming of any member of this place to try to make this a snide, unpleasant affair.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Bishop seems utterly unable to appreciate two things. One is a general matter of principle, and that is that one does not make assumptions about the validity of a complainant's complaint simply because a complaint has been laid. There are all sorts of circumstances in which complaints can be laid for all sorts of reasons, all sorts of motivations. Senator Bishop has leapt instantly to the conclusion that there did occur something to complain about. That is a matter ultimately for determination. If it cannot be resolved by some sort of informal process in which a person makes a complaint and the person the subject of the complaint acknowledges that there is some ground of legitimacy, then some other process has to be set in train if the matter is to be pursued.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But here we have a situation where the very existence of a ground for the complaint is vigorously denied by the person complained about. It is a matter of his human rights and a little bit of natural justice flowing in that direction for Senator Bishop, or anyone else minded to take up this or any related cause, not to leap to assumptions that something did happen which justified concern on the part of the individual. That may have occurred; it may not have occurred. It is totally inappropriate to make any other presumption than that of innocence about this, just as it is with any other matter of that particular kind.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point that I make is the one that Senator Bishop seems to have constantly forgotten, overlooked or ignored, and that is that this informal process was not one that has been thrust upon the complainant as part of one armoury of mechanisms that are available. This process was one that was sought by the complainant, as I am advised, in this particular case. It was sought to be resolved on an informal basis in the first instance by the complainant. It was made clear to her that she had many other forms of action or redress that she could take, including a formal inquiry established within the Department, as well as the Merit Protection and Review Agency, as well as HREOC, as well as the possible question of a formal legal process. That was made clear to her absolutely from the outset. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been made clear to her again, as I am advised, just in the last few days when the conciliator&mdash;the departmental person handling this&mdash;has formed the judgment that he is unable to bridge the gap that exists as to the matters of content and approach between the two parties. She has been advised that she may consider her position again as to which particular course she may go down. It is not helping her or anybody else to resolve this particular matter for this to be dragged into the public domain, with allegations being made wildly by Senator Bishop in this matter, by seeking to bring into it other issues which may or may not be totally peripheral to the resolution of this particular matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have nothing further to add on this particular case. I do not propose to do so. I have explained the variety of mechanisms that are available. I am assured that Mr Forrester has acted completely in accordance with the guidelines. I do not know&mdash;I was not sitting there&mdash;how the matter was handled in practice. I can only rely on the assurances that I have been given. I believe that there is nothing that Senator Bishop has brought forward to suggest other than that those procedures have been followed with absolutely impeccable rectitude by Mr Forrester and by my Department.

Whether one agrees that he was or was not, he has had the opportunity to put that on the record. He has not said where the article has misrepresented him or where Dr Blewett has misrepresented him. To the extent that there is any misrepresentation, he has covered that. I do not know how, going into Mr Bannon, South Australia and whatever else he wants to do, he in any way affects whether he was or was not misrepresented. He has clarified that issue to the satisfaction of the Senate. I think that should be the end of his explanation.</PARA></TALK.START>

I was misrepresented by what Dr Blewett said today in the House of Representatives, which was to quote selectively one sentence from an article; in other words, to make no reference to real increases, which I would have thought was very significant, and also not to put the article in the context of the problems facing governments.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mr Bishop,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of March 6th in which you ask why pensions are geared to the CPI. Although this is a matter for which the Federal Government is responsible, I provide the following comments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pensions are linked to the CPI so that pensioners' incomes do not fall behind increases in the cost of living. Wage and salary earners (including Members of Parliament) do not have this advantage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When there is a positive CPI, as is almost always the case, pensions are increased accordingly. When there is a negative CPI, as occurred in June 1991, pensions are not, however, decreased.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many wage and salary earners would very much like to be in your position and have their income automatically increased every six months, rather than have it eroded by inflation as has been the case in recent years of wage restraint. Although there are some salary earners, such as many business executives, who have had increases over and above the CPI, the vast majority have not even kept up with inflation as pensioners have.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Labour Government has not only linked pensions to the CPI, but it gave an additional increase in June 1990 to bring the pension to just over 25% of Average Weekly Earnings. In fact, the real value (that is, the value over and above indexation increases) of the pension has increased by 11.8% since the Labor Government came to office. This compares with a drop of 2.5% in the seven years of the previous Liberal/National Party Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Labor Government intends to continue to index pensions to the CPI. There is no guarantee, however, that the Liberal Opposition would do the same if they came to power. Their Social Security spokesman, Senator Alston, said recently: "It would be very difficult for a coalition government to increase old-age pensions . . . Realistically, it's unlikely that they would go up much, if at all". (Financial Review, 6th March 1992).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labor is also committed to removing all aged full and part pensioners from the tax system by 1995. The Liberal Opposition has not made this commitment.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Libs plan tax on transitional period super lump-sums</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">by Joseph Dowling</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A coalition government would introduce a tax on lump-sum superannuation payments of more than $300,000 during a transitional period, the Opposition retirement incomes spokesman, Senator Richard Alston, said yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Fightback! package released by the Opposition in November, it was proposed that lump-sum payments would be capped at $300,000 and made tax-free.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposal had left confusion in the industry over the treatment of people who already had accumulated entitlements above the proposed $300,000 lump-sum limit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, in an interview with <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> yesterday, Senator Alston said the committee formed by the Opposition to examine aspects of the superannuation package was focusing on establishing an appropriate level of tax on lump sums above $300,000 until the coalition's regime was well and truly under way. He said the tax would be "something less than 15 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"At the moment, there are people with entitlements in excess of $300,000 and we don't want to retrospectively stop them from taking their accrued entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"But, because we're abolishing lump-sum taxes from day one, we don't want to give these blokes a windfall where they would otherwise be paying a 15 per cent tax. We'll therefore devise this low level flat rate tax during a transition period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"After five years and once the new regime is well and truly under way, there won't be people with an excess of $300,000, because that is the cap, the limit," he said.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amounts above $300,000 would have to be taken in the shape of annuities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The senator also said the superannuation committee under Professor David Knox, would examine treatment of contributions tax for defined benefit schemes, some of which may be on contributions holidays.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As well, he indicated that it would be very difficult for a coalition government to increase old-age pensions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The fact that you've got a rising aged population makes it pretty likely that you can't just go on having real increases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The pressures will be it will be very difficult to increase the pension and people ought to realise that. Realistically, it's unlikely that they would go up much, if at all," he said.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recognition of that, tax incentives to invest in superannuation would underpin the Opposition's non-compulsory superannuation arrangements, he said.</PARA>

What that letter by Mr Bannon did&mdash;and I presume it was on a considered basis; perhaps aided, abetted and encouraged by the likes of Senator Bolkus and Dr Blewett&mdash;was to say that I had said it would be very difficult for a coalition government to increase old age pensions, and to attribute that to an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>. There is nothing in what I said that uses those words, so they are not in any shape or form a direct quotation from the article. If that is not a deliberate misrepresentation, I do not know what is. To put something in quotes and then to put in brackets `<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> 6 March' surely is saying to anyone who reads that that these words are directly taken from an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>.

He was State Secretary of the South Australian branch of the ALP from 1947 to 1955 and for a time he held the position of State party President. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His career as a parliamentarian in the Senate spanned 18 years, from 1953 to 1971. During this time, Jim Toohey worked on various Senate committees with diligence and distinction. As well, he was appointed to represent the Australian Parliament at the United Nations in New York.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have here a copy of one of former Senator Toohey's speeches, which was given in relation to the Budget in 1953. It seems that the words are apposite to the circumstances of today, when we are also dealing with the present Budget. On that occasion, Senator Toohey said of the then Prime Minister:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On that occasion he advocated&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is the Prime Minister&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the entry of a greater number of businessmen into the political life of this nation. He said that because we were now dealing with budgets amounting to #1,000,000,000 &mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>a remarkable amount for the time&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">it was essential that we should have in the legislative halls of this country, businessmen who could steer the various financial deals through to a proper conclusion. I certainly do not subscribe to the belief that there is any need for the intrusion of businessmen into the Commonwealth or State Parliaments.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not say they should be excluded, but I believe that the business of the nation and the welfare of the people should never become inconsequential sidelines of somebody engaged actively in the pursuit of profits. The influx of great numbers of businessmen into our Parliaments would have exactly that result. The Parliaments of this country need men and women whose hearts and minds can be moved by suffering and who have a burning desire to correct injustices. Above all, we need men and women whose ears are so attuned that even above the roar of commerce and industry they can hear the cry for mercy of the underprivileged.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do not need businessmen to do that. When one looks through the legislation that has been placed on the statute-book in this and other countries, one finds that every measure that has for its aim the advancement of the human race was placed there by people of the homespun kind who know and understand the needs of the people and not by hard-boiled businessmen who are so concerned with chasing profits that the real problems of the people escape them.</PARA>
<PARA>As Senator Button said, we want people with understanding in our legislatures. I never knew Senator Toohey. However, it seems to me that, if that is an expression of his sentiments during his 18 years in Parliament, one can only say `Hear, hear!', and that they are as relevant today as they were in 1953 when he made them.

In the case of Jim Toohey, I saw him not only as a close, warm and personal friend but also very much as a confidant in both my personal and political life. Jim was very much a true believer all his life and applied his principles of honesty, sensitivity and equality to whatever role he played in his life. Irrespective of whether it was his interaction with individuals, communities or organisations within our community, Jim was not only a person who was liked and trusted but also someone on whom people could always rely for a calm head, a calm voice and a calm dose of advice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been noted already, former Senator Toohey was born in 1909 very much in the heart of Adelaide. To assume the right label for the rest of his life, he very quickly supported and became involved in the West Adelaide Football Club, which was the right thing to do in that part of the city at that time. It was an interest he followed until his last days. He was lucky in 1983 to see his team win a grand final. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Jim maintained a concern for the working class in our community, who were the closest to him. As has also been evidenced in this discussion this afternoon, his concern went further than just one subgroup of the community. Whatever he did in life and no matter with whom he interacted, he applied a very healthy dose of intelligence and commonsense in a very sensitive way. As a consequence, he was widely respected as a gentle person and widely admired and listened to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one is to define how Jim approached life or how he was seen by others with whom he interacted, the best title for him is that he was very much an honest broker. His history of community involvement started with the trade union movement and the Vehicle Builders Union, whatever it was called in the days when he was a member&mdash;it did have a different name then&mdash;which was an organisation by whom he was widely respected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Involvement with the Labor Party was a matter of course for Jim. His involvement was recognised not only in South Australia but nationally. As Senator Button mentioned, he also had an international presence. He was State Secretary of the Party from 1947-53, State President from 1954-55 and a senator representing the State of South Australia for 18 years from 1953-71. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those raw figures do not adequately demonstrate the role that Jim played in community and political affairs. If one was to go to Jim's most important contribution in community and political life, though he would modestly deny it, others would recognise that Jim Toohey was very much the father of Labor in South Australia over the last four or five decades. He was the pivotal part of a troika consisting of himself, Clyde Cameron and Geoff Virgo&mdash;two rather headstrong and assertive characters&mdash;but Jim always had the capacity to bring them together and, in doing so, built a very solid basis from which the Labor movement in South Australia could operate. </PARA>

It was a talkfest in that it provided a good sounding-board for ideas for a lot of us who had been working in Canberra, but more importantly, it provided a good forum for interaction for younger people coming into and through the Party. That lunch club has continued and it was only a few weeks ago that Jim went to his last lunch at Chinatown. </PARA>

It is interesting to note that this very meek and gentlemanly person was given the responsibility in 1957 by the National Conference of the Labor Party essentially to take over the New South Wales branch of the Party. At any time that would have been a daunting feat for any person, but Jim did it extremely well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to express my deepest sadness at the loss of Jim Toohey. He was a great South Australian Labor identity and a good friend of mine.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The South Australian branch of the Labor Party and, indeed, the Party nationally, owes much to Jim Toohey. His organisational ability revolutionised the operations of the South Australian ALP. While Jim was State Secretary he worked to ensure that the Party remained united. He recognised that there were many differences of opinion, but that these differences should not impede the effectiveness of the Party. Under the direction of Jim Toohey in South Australia, the ALP was able to prepare itself for the end of the electoral gerrymander, when Labor could take power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that Jim&mdash;as Senator Bolkus mentioned&mdash;was temporary State Secretary of the New South Wales branch of the ALP for a period. He was appointed to this position by the Federal Executive because of his impressive organisational skills and effective performance in South Australia. Further, it should be recognised that South Australia and New South Wales were the only States to avoid the destructive ALP splits of the 1950s. In fact, Jim is well remembered for his attempts to reduce factional conflict at the national level whilst he was Federal Senior Vice-President of the Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like many of us, Jim Toohey became involved with the ALP through the union movement. I am very proud to say that Jim was a member of the same union that I was Secretary of prior to coming to this place. The Vehicle Builders Union was the second biggest ALP affiliated union in South Australia when Jim joined it and became involved. He worked originally at Chrysler and later at General Motors Holden as a car body builder, and for a time he also worked at the aircraft production workshops at Islington. In all of these jobs he took on the role of shop steward, which gave him much exposure within the union movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The union was to have the benefit of his tremendous organisational ability from 1944 to 1947 when he served as Assistant Secretary and Organiser for the VBU. During his service to the union many within the Labor movement noted his ability and commitment. Indeed, the Party made him State Secretary in 1947, a position he would hold until his election to the Senate in 1953. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trade union movement has lost a great friend and supporter in Jim Toohey. His union career was always important to him and I remember that he would often talk about his involvement in the 10-day time-study strike. Jim was on the West Torrens District Council, as was mentioned earlier, and took those duties very seriously. He was an active person in the community throughout his life.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Party office in Adelaide became a very efficient and effective operation under Toohey's direction. Jim introduced elements of technology such as a Gestetner copying unit. Also, he was the first Party Secretary to use a car purchased by the ALP. He would travel all around the State drumming up support for the Party and establishing branches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Politics in South Australia has always been a little different from the other States. Indeed, we tend to be less cutthroat and more conciliatory. This applies to the ALP itself. Organised factions are quite a new phenomena in South Australia and consensus decision-making still plays a pivotal role. Jim Toohey probably had as much to do with this as anyone. He was an exceptional political organiser who had the great ability to be able to negotiate and reach consensus without causing conflict. Along with a number of other ALP figures and union leaders, Toohey was able to ensure that potential conflict and divisions were ironed out before they could lead to problems for the Party. Jim was also an exceptional orator with the ability to sway the State convention or any other forum with relative ease. He was rational, reasoned and forceful with his arguments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1953 Jim was elected to this place to serve the people of South Australia. During his 18 years here he proved his commitment by continually raising issues that were important to his constituents. His contributions to this place in the way of speeches and questions were a credit to his ability and integrity. On committees he was a lively participant and particularly enjoyed his involvement on the Australian Capital Territory Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Jim served in this place with a fellow South Australian, Clem Ridley, who also came from the Vehicle Builders Union. They were great mates for many years. In fact, they first worked together selling rabbits as youths. Like all of us in the Labor Party, comradeship was important to Toohey. Unfortunately, Jim never experienced a Labor Government while he served in the Senate. Therefore, his time here did not have the highs I am sure he would have wished for. He did once represent Australia in the United Nations in 1968, which he counted as one of the most interesting aspects of his parliamentary life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Jim Toohey was a man of very high principles and great moral fibre. He believed in and promoted consensus decision-making, while at the same time recognising the cut-and-thrust nature of the political system. In South Australia we often call this consensus approach to politics `Tooheyism'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Jim enjoyed life and experienced many things. He played football for Parklands when he was young, his father was a builders' labourer and he went to Cowandilla State School, as was mentioned earlier. He was ordinary in origins, but a great man in stature. There is not one South Australian Labor MP, senator or legislative councillor who has not been influenced, inspired or touched by Jim Toohey. No other person in South Australia has been involved so much in the administration and direction of a political party. He attended Party functions until his death and his influence within the party was immense until the end. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on this condolence motion for a great friend, Jim Toohey. As a former State Secretary of the ALP in South Australia, I appreciate the service and the record of Jim Toohey as a previous State Secretary. Jim was State Secretary of the Party in South Australia from 1947 to 1953. When he became State Secretary, the Party organisation at a formal level was quite bereft of resources and of influence. It had been through a long period of turmoil during the 1930s when the Labor Party in South Australia split into three different parties. Jim took over in 1947 and very quickly brought together the remaining dissident groups within the Labor movement and combined them within the Labor Party so that they became a very effective political force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1953 he sought election for the Senate. Typical of the Jim Toohey attitude, when he could have easily taken a very safe spot at No. 1 or No. 2 on the ticket, he chose to stand at what we call the marginal position, at No. 3 on the ticket, because he thought that was the right thing to do. It was a very good year for the Labor Party. He won a seat then and was re-elected a number of times until he retired in 1971. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When he retired from the Senate in 1971, there was much astonishment in South Australia because Jim was only in his early sixties. Under our then retirement age rule he was still eligible for at least another six years had he chosen to stand. When people asked him why he was standing down and not seeking re-election when everyone expected the Whitlam led Labor Party to win the 1972 election and when he clearly would have been a major contender to be a senior Minister in that  government, he said, `It is better to retire from Parliament when people are asking you, "Why are you retiring?" than when they are saying to you, "Why are you staying?"'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was always his attitude to politics. He believed that it is always better to go out on a top note than to hang around until people get desperate to shift you on or you outstay your welcome. He always believed that about State secretaries. He said that six years as a State Secretary in South Australia was more than enough for anybody. It needed a turnover. It needed new people with new ideas to come into the position&mdash;new blood. He certainly impressed upon me and his other successors that the position of State Secretary should not be seen as a long term career position because the longer someone is there, the more ineffectual that person will become because of the nature of politics. That is very good, simple, commonsense advice that the Party in South Australia has now followed for over 40 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1950s, Jim Toohey played a major role, as some of my colleagues have mentioned, in ensuring that the devastating split that destroyed the Labor Party in other States did not come to South Australia. I think his contribution to stopping the split in South Australia was greater than that of any other Labor figure. As senior national vice-president at that time, he played a role that was very difficult to carry out because of the split, because of the animosities and because of the personality differences that were alive in the Labor Party at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Jim Toohey always believed that politics is a pretty simple art in a way. All one has to use is good commonsense in dealing with people and one cannot go far wrong or get into too many difficulties. That was something he expressed to many of us who succeeded him, to many of us who listened to his advice. He told us to treat people as we would expect to be treated, to be reasonable, to use commonsense and the Party would do well. He also told us never to get too far ahead of what the mainstream of our supporters want, to educate them but to understand that they have views that should be noted, and to always listen and take note of other people's views. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the success of the Labor Party in South Australia over nearly 50 years since the Second World War is overwhelmingly a tribute to the commonsense approach of Jim Toohey. He once talked to me and to others about the position of State Secretary and also, as an influential figure, about the use of power. He said that power is a commodity and that once you start using it it starts to diminish. He said that it has to be realised that no matter how good people may think they are power has to be used with great discretion and that even when people are using it well they are going to upset some people because at times they have to be honest with them and explain to them what they are about. He said that people should not run away from the fact that at times they have to use power creatively and constructively for the good of the Party and not just for the good of themselves or other individuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Jim Toohey will be remembered in the Labor Party in South Australia as one of the great figures in our 100-year history. Already there are many memorials to Jim and his contribution, memorials established before he unfortunately passed away last weekend. For example, the boardroom of the ALP head office in South Australia is called the Jim Toohey Executive Room in recognition of his contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After Jim retired from Parliament in 1971, he continued to play a very active role within the Labor Party. For many years he came to State conventions and State Council as an ex officio delegate. Whenever he spoke, he invariably persuaded the convention or the Council to his point of view because of the sheer good commonsense of what he was expressing. Jim Toohey has held every position the State branch of the Labor Party in South Australia can give, and he held most of those without opposition. He also held most of the senior positions of the Party organisation at the national level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the Party in South Australia and the community have lost a towering figure. I must say with great regret that it is highly unlikely that I will be able to attend Jim's funeral on Friday because I have to chair a select committee of the Senate. It is a matter of great personal regret that I will not be able to attend the funeral. </PARA>

For 10 years this Labor Government has neglected the health care system of this nation, after it introduced Medicare.

After 10 years, we have finally reached the stage when the Government, in the depths of despair and facing electoral defeat at the next election, has been forced to acknowledge the problems inherent in its health system. However, the only action taken by this Government is to raise the Medicare levy and throw money at the symptoms without addressing the underlying problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government's record on health is an absolute disgrace and nothing in last night's Budget did anything to change that. Over the last 10 years, waiting lists have increased to between 70,000 and 100,000. Private hospitals are currently under-utilised with a 55 per cent to 60 per cent occupancy rate. Hospitals have been closed in rural areas and hospital costs have increased by 12 per cent per annum&mdash;163 per cent in the last 10 years. The cost of private health insurance has risen 130 per cent in the last five years. About 20 per cent of people who used to be covered by private health insurance have left the system. That is the state of Australia's health system as it stands today.</PARA>

Their solution was to encourage people to go into private health insurance. </PARA>

So how&mdash;and I believe `how' is the operative word&mdash;is he going to get the money? Will he increase it in later years? In August 1991 he said he would have to increase it. So if the Australian public is misled by anything that he has said in the Budget or anything that he says in the media today about it not increasing, then they are being fooled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why has the Minister changed his mind? Why did he spin around on the piece of string? When asked yesterday on ABC radio whether there would be any future increase after yesterday's rise to 1.4 per cent, the Minister was reluctant to comment, saying it would not be very useful to do so. No wonder it would not be useful to do so; he had said only a year ago that it would have to be increased. He said it would have to be 1.53 per cent at least, and after that it would increase in future years. No wonder he was reluctant to comment. I would bet that the Minister already had another rise in the Medicare levy in mind, because he said in 1991 that that is what he would have to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last night we witnessed Labor's move to destroy the private system and remove the choice Australians have had until now of whether they are treated privately or publicly. The private health system will be destroyed by yesterday's measures. There is absolutely no incentive to take out private health insurance and take the responsibility of looking after one's own health. Labor has already sunk the boot into private health insurance, and last night's measures are designed to hit the rest of the private market on the head with a sledge-hammer. The injection of some funds into the public health system may have some minor effect on hospital waiting lists, but it does nothing to address the fundamental structural problems in our health system. </PARA>

What did the Government do? Labor was going to introduce a two-year hospital waiting list assistance program. It was going to provide $50m over two years to bring down hospital waiting lists. What did it do?  Exactly the same solution&mdash;not `solution', thing&mdash;it is doing now to try to solve the problem. But the Government is directing money at the symptoms, not the underlying cause. Russell Schneider from the Australian Health Insurance Association put it very succinctly when he said that it is a mere drop in the bedpan. It does nothing to solve the hospital waiting lists&mdash;nothing at all. </PARA>

They will most probably listen to the Government's furphy: `Here it is! Medicare&mdash;an equitable and fair system. You will now be able to get into a public hospital. Don't worry if you have a problem with your hip with arthritis. You'll get in. You won't have to wait 14 months.

They are not getting in the money from the private sector. They told me that what we need is a system that encourages people into private health insurance. That was repeated again and again at Daylesford, at Trentham and at Melton.

It was because the policy was changed so that Mr Keating could buy a few votes for his leadership last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Madam Acting Deputy President, you know exactly what I mean by that.

Private health insurance tax credits will be directed at the aged and low and middle income earners. Senator Walters will be talking about that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the announcements made in the Budget last night, including the vitalising structural reform of the health care system which goes under the proud title of Medicare and which has been adopted by the Australian people as a health care system of which they can be extremely proud. The modifications which were announced last night will only enhance the affection with which the Medicare system is held in Australia, not only in an emotional sort of way but in actual delivery of better health care services for the Australian people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that we are not obsessed with Medicare as a health financing system. We want to see it evolve more clearly into a health care system with all components of the medical and hospital treatment systems being brought together in a way which serves Australians better. That is why we are not as obsessed as the Opposition clearly is with the question of private health insurance as a means of financing the health care system. We prefer, as I will elaborate later, a system of raising money for the health care system which is not so dependent on private health insurance premiums but is properly dependent on a fairer distribution of the costs, through the tax and Medicare levy system, amongst the Australian people. That can then provide a health care system which is open to all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in relation to access to public hospitals that most attention has been focused. There is certainly a need to ensure that the public hospital system in Australia is not allowed to run down, as it undoubtedly would under the Opposition's scheme, and is instead given the capacity, through funding and other arrangements, to provide for the health care needs of Australians. That has to be a provision of services, including hospital treatment and medical treatment in outpatients and so on&mdash;but hospital bed days are of particular importance. Access to beds must be based on clear, clinical assessment and needs and without any temptation for public hospitals in the allocation of beds to prefer in a discriminatory way those with private health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will be providing a bonus of $1.23 billion over the next six years to those public hospitals which cooperate. Of course, this will be a cooperative and collaborative endeavour; it will not be imposed. It will be a cooperative endeavour with the States and Territories and their public hospital systems in order to ensure that all those who wish to avail themselves of public hospital treatment will be able to without having the fear that they will not be able to get a bed. I believe it is that fear that they may not be able to get a bed, which was alluded to by Senator Patterson, which drives many of them to take out private health insurance at a level at which they might otherwise not choose to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no argument that Australians should be free to take out private insurance if they wish to do so, but they should not be driven to it by fear that the public hospital system will not be able to provide them with the bed they require when they need hospital treatment. The fact is that by providing this extra funding to the public hospital system we will be able to provide that capacity, and therefore that fear will evaporate, whereas the Opposition will not provide the same level of funding for public hospitals. It will decrease funding to public hospitals because it needs to provide money for the subsidies it will pay to certain levels of income earners in Australia for their private insurance premiums. Those subsidies have to come from the taxpayers. If the subsidies are paid for in the scale of the hundreds of millions that will be required, then that is money that will not be made available directly to the public hospitals through the States grants system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian people are faced with a clear choice between the Government's proposal that the public hospital system be revitalised by direct injection of funds from the taxpayers or the coalition's proposal that taxpayers' funds go to subsidise private health insurance premiums. Private health insurance premiums will certainly need to be subsidised because we know that those private health insurance premiums will have to rise to meet the costs of the health care system. They will escalate because the Opposition, in its market driven ideology, will allow the AMA of course to set much higher rates than it mostly charges at the moment for general practitioner consultations and for other medical services. We could expect that private hospitals will also try to charge what the market might bear. Health insurance premiums will have to rise to try to alleviate some of the financial pain that will thereby be occasioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable senator who wrote the letter to the President putting forward this matter of public importance spoke occasionally in terms of an ideological obsession by the Labor Party. I do not believe that is a fair characterisation at all of the position of the Labor Party. I find it very peculiar that a party which prides itself on freedom of choice as one of its ideological planks&mdash;I believe it is a good platform within the Australian community that people should be free to choose&mdash;has, for example, within its own health care provision proposals said to doctors that they will not be able to offer bulkbilling to Australians unless they are pensioners or cardholders. So a medical practitioner conducting a general practice in a suburb, city or rural area will not be able to make that choice as to how he or she wishes to fund the practice by bulkbilling. That is really quite an extraordinary denial of the freedom of choice of doctors within the system. I believe therefore that the ideological purity being claimed for the Opposition in these matters is very severely undermined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very true that the problem of effective waiting list management and reduction is an absolutely key issue for many in the community. It is also the case that we do not have a clear picture of the situation, despite the figures that are sometimes bandied around by Senator Patterson. I believe that Victoria&mdash;Senator Patterson would be aware of this; it is to Victoria's credit&mdash;is the only State which has a very clear picture available of the waiting list situation. We need to provide funds to those areas&mdash;also those specialty areas, not only geographic areas&mdash;where waiting lists are particularly long. That means that we cannot have an Australia-wide approach; it will obviously have to be sensitively directed and differentially allocated to various areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite clearly, administrative procedures need to be enhanced so that there can be better administrative marshalling of the booking and management of waiting times. There will also have to be processes to enable the opening of theatres and surgical wards, the employing of additional support staff using spare capacity in private hospitals and the promoting of greater use of day surgery for some procedures and so on in a way which will help to reduce the waiting lists. For that reason, some $50m has been allocated in 1992-93 and almost $21m in the following year to allow hospitals to put better procedures in place to enable those waiting lists to be reduced. I believe that these key measures are absolutely essential and will be very welcomed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government makes no apology for the decision announced in the Budget last night to impose an extra 0.14 per cent on the taxable income of persons above a certain threshold in order to raise the levy from 1.25 per cent to 1.4 per cent of taxable income. The basic difference between the Government and the Opposition is that, in order to provide more funds for the health care system in Australia, the Opposition believes that the best way to do that is to work through the private health insurance funds&mdash;in other words, by way of the contribution of premiums from people, some of which will have to be subsidised, on their own admission in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback</EMPHASIS>, to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars by the taxpayers. I am sure that Senator Herron would not deny that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition sees the best way of providing more funds for the health care system is through the private health insurance system. We have a different view that Australians are prepared to accept. This will be done not through private health insurance which, by definition, means that the premium is paid regardless of the income status of the person and therefore subsidies might be needed for the very low income groups. We say that the contribution to the health care of fellow Australians and for oneself can be more equitably provided through raising the Medicare levy, which we provided for last night, and through the taxation system&mdash;in other words, through a progressive system which depends on capacity and ability to pay. I believe that that more egalitarian approach for those only who have the capacity to pay for their health care and those of their fellow Australians is a far fairer system than the private health insurance scheme that the Opposition proposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Medicare levy that is proposed only has to be paid by individuals who earn over $11,887 and by married couples who have a combined income of $20,070, with provision for extra dependent children of $2,100 per dependent child. It means that a family of two adults and two children with an earning capacity of, say, $580 per week will pay an extra 87c per week. That is not an extravagant amount to enable the Government to put forward this very comprehensive package which will allow for the refurbishing and upgrading of the capacity of the public health system so that those who require hospital treatment in the public health system can have the confidence that a bed will be available. That increase in the Medicare levy will raise $300m in 1993-94 and will contribute to the expansion of the hospital and hospital related care system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that when one looks at those sorts of contributions that are asked for out of the persons who have the capacity to pay&mdash;as announced last night, an increase in the levy from 1.25 per cent to 1.4 per cent&mdash;one can see that to pay 80c, 87c, 90c, 95c or even $1 per week extra is not a lot to ask from those who have that capacity in order to provide for the health care of Australians. The Opposition is not only proposing that the tax system will provide money for the health care system, and the Medicare levy will be retained on top of the tax system, but also requiring that private health insurance premiums be taken out at an extra expense to the individuals and households. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These points that I am making are part of a much wider restructuring of Australia's primary health care system. Over the past several months very significant discussions have already taken place between the Government and the Royal College of General Practitioners&mdash;I hope that the AMA has been involved also&mdash;to ensure that we do not have a system where money is thrown at an unstructured, oversupplied system of general practice. There has been general agreement that something had to be done about the number of doctors who were entering Australia from overseas and that there ought to be a rural incentive package, worth $8m in this financial year and $15m indexed a year thereafter, to improve access to GPs in rural areas. Most Australians would recognise that, whilst it is sometimes said that there is an oversupply of doctors, it is probably a maldistribution which is of more concern. In many areas, particularly in rural and provincial parts of Australia, the availability of general practitioners is not what it ought to be if one was simply dividing the number of general practitioners into the population and getting some per capita figure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, the Government has been very keen to ensure that in this Budget and in succeeding Budgets provision is made for the incentives to encourage doctors to practise in country and rural areas of Australia or to reward those who have already made that decision and who are already involved in the provision of primary health care for so many Australians in those rural areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite clearly, the innovations in the area of general practice, which have been the subject of much discussion in the last year. Practice accreditation and the question of local networks or divisions of general practice are also under discussion. The strengthening of locational registration arrangements to further promote and reward high quality general practice is to go ahead and we will also be reducing our reliance on overseas trained doctors. All these matters point to a more comprehensive approach than would simply be the case if one was talking about changing the health financing system from taxation plus Medicare levy and some private health insurance to an emphasis on private health insurance, such as the Opposition would propose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a much more comprehensive matter than simply financing; it is a question of health care for all Australians. In particular, stronger primary health care sector provision through general practitioners of a high quality is an obvious way in which we can make the necessary emphasis to improve health care for Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that what was proposed in the Budget last night will be acceptable to most Australians because most Australians want the public hospital system to continue. They want to see it strengthened. They do not like to see the public hospitals in their local cities or towns run down, lacking the capacity to undertake even capital works planning of a sophisticated kind, let alone the provision of such capital works to increase the physical provision of the public hospitals concerned. They certainly want to know that, if they have an accident or need to receive treatment within the public hospital system, a bed will be available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The $1.23 billion to be provided over the next six years, combined with the attack on waiting lists, will, I think, alleviate much of the fear and misgiving which has perhaps got some hold in the public mind. I believe that what is being proposed will also be supported as a fair way to distribute the costs of enhancing the provision of health care for Australians. The levy system, based as it is on ability to pay&mdash;over a certain threshold you have to pay, but below that threshold you are not required to pay&mdash;I think is a fair system which appeals to the sense of fairness of Australians, as opposed to a system which depends so heavily, as the Opposition's package does, on private health insurance premiums which, of course, have to be paid by all, regardless of their income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the low income earners, the Opposition will move hundreds of millions of dollars from taxpayers to the private health insurance funds by way of subsidies to those low income earners to take out insurance. We prefer to see the money moved from the taxpayers direct to the public hospitals, to the enhancement of the provision of primary health care by general practitioners and the provision of health care services particularly in rural areas, and in so many other ways restructure the health system in a way which will benefit all Australians. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not take much figuring out to realise that it really would not be that wonderful at all. It is pretty clear that just about everybody except the Opposition, the AMA and the private health insurance funds&mdash;we must acknowledge that there is some self-interest in there&mdash;sees that what the Opposition is proposing will result in spiralling costs and reduced services. As I have said before on this topic, I find it ironic that, at a time when many countries are looking to our system here, to a greater commitment to universal public health care to overcome the problems of their totally private systems, the Opposition in this country is determined to move in quite the opposite direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, the Opposition's health policies represent a giant leap backwards. If you want to see the future of health care under a Hewson Government, take a look at the United States and its appalling and very costly health system&mdash;a health system that has one of the highest rates of infant mortality anywhere in the Western World. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge that the debate about the provision of health services is partly one of philosophical or ideological differences, but it is also a debate which needs to move beyond ideological posturing and blatant self-interest if we are to seriously address and remedy the problems in our health care system. The continuing calls for the abolition of Medicare, premised on vested interests, should not have a place in this debate. For example, I note the response of Bruce Shepherd of the AMA to the Budget measures. Dr Shepherd is being his usual constructive self, foreshadowing that doctors are going to battle with the Federal Government in what he persists in seeing as the Government trying to take control of the health system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking through the Budget Papers, I do not see this as the Government's aim, although as I have said before, there are some compelling arguments in favour of Medicare becoming the national insurer. But even if we grant that there is a little too much influence on the part of the Government, Dr Shepherd obviously expects us to believe that putting himself and his colleagues in the private insurance industry in control of the health system would somehow give us a much  better system and would be a good idea. That is what the Opposition agrees with. It has said to the AMA that it can fix its own fees and that that would be wonderful, and that somehow the all-curing free market will operate to make sure that those fees remain at a reasonable level. That is just nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aside from the obvious and demonstrable fact that market signals are undermined by the distinctive nature of the health care system and simply do not work in this context, what is there to convince Australians that giving the medical profession and the private insurers even greater control of the health dollar than they already have would be a better idea than letting Dracula loose in the blood bank?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind honourable senators that, at the same time as the AMA was bleating about the costs of Medicare, it was running a case before the New South Wales Industrial Commission arguing for a pay rise in excess of 50 per cent for the 2,700 specialists who act as visiting medical officers in that State's public hospital system, thereby resulting in an additional $100m per year being paid from public funds into the pockets of specialists already earning between $127.50 and $135.50 an hour. So how committed are they really to the public health system, and to the public hospital system in particular? Australian health consumers would be perfectly entitled to ask whether these specialists were more concerned with the protection of their not inconsiderable incomes than with improving access to, and use of, the public health system. </PARA>

What Australians do want is a responsible and comprehensive health care system. I believe that they will not continue to tolerate the sort of strident self-interest advocated by Dr Shepherd and a few others at the expense of the overall health system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Medicare continues to be popular with the Australian public. It is very hard to think of another Government program or, indeed, a private program that is as popular, that enjoys such widespread support. As I have repeatedly said when talking about Medicare, it is not hard to see why it continues to be popular. On any objective analysis&mdash;one that is not blinkered by ideology or vested interests&mdash;Medicare has, despite its problems, provided Australians with equitable access to relatively cheap health care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provision of free services via Medicare has protected low income households from the costs of basic health care, that is, GP services, hospital care and prescriptions. The national health strategy paper <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Spending on Health</EMPHASIS> concludes that free, or certainly low cost, basic health care protects low income persons with little capacity to pay even small out-of-pocket costs and high users. Those high users include some people with disabilities, the chronically ill and some members of our ageing community. These are people whose out-of-pocket expenses would mount up very quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians understand, as previous speakers have mentioned, that they do not receive their health care for nothing; they know that it comes out via the levy. They are quite well aware that they pay for it through that and also through general taxation. The continuing support for Medicare by the Australian community does justify the moves that the Government has taken in this Budget in relation to the levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats welcome the Government's reaffirmation of its commitment to Medicare, although we do not think that the Government has been decisive or as forceful in many of these measures as it could have been. It is certainly very late in some measures, such as the final recognition that the State hospital system needed some extra support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats see the provision of basic health care as a desirable social and economic objective and, although we still see considerable room for improvement in the delivery of health services, we do not consider 8 per cent of gross domestic product to be a staggeringly high rate of expenditure to achieve this end. We believe that, if the Opposition and the private insurers have their way, the end result will be a much higher percentage of GDP moving towards America's 13 per cent; a much higher amount spent on health care with no corresponding improvement in any aspect of our health care system, except in the profits of private insurers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence from overseas clearly indicates that those countries where public health insurance plays a role have been the most successful in controlling their health expenditures. The Democrats do not think that it is in our interests to move away from that sort of system, and we do not believe that the Australian public wants to move away; the Australian public does not want to move away from Medicare. Within this year's Budget, the increase in the levy is something that the Democrats have wanted to see for some time. It represents an important signal to the community that the Government is clearly committed to Medicare rather than a private or even substantially private health care system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I place on record our support for three other areas: firstly, the initiatives in the area of consumer and patient rights, the Medicare hospital patients' charter, complaints mechanisms, the enactment of legislation covering the principles of Medicare and the commitment to a national consumer advisory group for mental services; secondly, as I have already mentioned, the reforms relating to general practice and especially the rural incentives package and the funding for divisions of GPs; and, thirdly, the initiatives in the area of mental health, particularly the promotion of nationally agreed clinical standards and best practice initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reform in this area is long overdue, and the Federal Government's reluctance to involve itself in this neglected area of health has done it absolutely no credit at all. I trust the not especially generous allocation in this Budget is a reflection of a genuine intent on the part of the Government to stop avoiding its responsibilities in this area and to play a leading role in mental health reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I move on to the negatives. I am disappointed that the Keating Government, having distanced itself from last year's co-payment debacle and supposedly committed itself to developing Medicare as a health care system rather than merely as a health financing system, has presented a health budget that does not seize the opportunity to come to grips with three areas that the Democrats have been concerned with for many years. They are dental health services, alternative therapies and preventive health programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to dental health services, there is a small contribution, some $500,000, for the establishment of a research database to look at the supply of dental care. This is welcome and certainly long overdue, but it really is time that the issues of incorporating dental services within Medicare and the provision of extensive public dental services were seriously tackled by the Federal Government. Some State governments have been doing it. In particular, I acknowledge what the South Australian Government has achieved. The results that it has got from its schools dental program are certainly significant. But there is still a lot more to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Something I would have liked to have spent more time on today is the issue of alternative therapies. That is certainly an area we need to look at. There is a range of options that need to be acknowledged. Their valuable roles should be acknowledged and they should be seen as playing a real and positive part in health treatment. Preventive health services is an area in which I worked for many years before moving into this place. If Medicare is to really become a comprehensive health system, then it must incorporate more than merely a token commitment to preventive health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some very minimal bits and pieces in this Budget. There is some minimal recognition, but it is nowhere near enough. In particular, I am interested in seeing a concerted effort made to address health problems of young people&mdash;in particular, young people in our schools. It is well demonstrated that socio-economic factors are directly linked to quality of health, and this correlation receives very little, if any, recognition in the public health system. We should be looking at prevention in schools. We should be looking at projects in schools in those areas which are identified as having health problems linked with geographic, socio-economic factors. I am not talking about just more lectures, discussion and pictures on the walls. What I am talking about is daily physical education and nutritional food supplements. </PARA>

For example, a $30,000 income earner already pays income tax of $6,593.62. Previously, these people were paying another $375 tax into Consolidated Revenue.

At the same time that taxpayer is to pay that extra $420, supposedly, Australia spends an average of $1,796 per person on health care. So the Medicare levy does not come within a bull's roar of paying for health care. It goes straight into Consolidated Revenue and the rest comes from income taxes, State taxes and private funds. In fact, in the last eight years&mdash;and the Australian Democrats might like to take a note of this&mdash;the health funds raised $12.3 billion and the levy raised only $11.2 billion. Last year the levy raised $2 1/2 billion and the health funds raised $3.4 billion. Next year the health funds will again raise more money than the levy. Yet we have the illusion somehow that taxpayers have paid for their health care, and we have the Government and the Democrats denigrating the private health industry itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The private health industry is essential for the continuation of Australia's health care system. In fact, the Medicare levy was the source of only 8 per cent of health funding. Of other government funding&mdash;that is, tax revenue&mdash;35 per cent comes from Federal funding and 26 per cent comes from State and local funding: a total government funding of 69 per cent. Private health insurance funding is 11 per cent, and individuals out of their pockets pay 15 per cent. Total health expenditure last year was $30 billion&mdash;as I mentioned, $1,796 per person&mdash;and it has been on average 8 per cent of GDP over the last 16 years. It was more last year, in fact, as a percentage of GDP because of a real fall in gross domestic product as a result of the recession. Real health expenditure grew by only 3.1 per cent in 1990-91. It was lower than the average 4 per cent of the previous five years. The government funding of health care fell 3 per cent between February 1984 when Medicare was introduced and 1990-91 due to a fall in the Commonwealth contribution. State and local government and private expenditure increased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the average 8 per cent of GDP which the Government claims as a great success. That has not occurred in any other country in the OECD. The figure for OECD countries has risen over that period. We are now $740 a head below the average of the nine OECD nations&mdash;the United Kingdom, New Zealand, France, Germany, Canada, Japan, USA, Sweden and ourselves. We are $740 less per head. And we talk about a great health care system! We have not kept pace in any shape or form with our competitors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the $300m that is supposedly going to come with the increase in the levy. It will not even cover this year's increment in health expenditure. It would not have been necessary if Minister Howe had not been rolled last year on the introduction of co-payments in order to save Mr Keating's job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I previously mentioned, Federal Government expenditure has decreased. Since the introduction of Medicare in 1984, the real level of both Commonwealth hospital and general revenue grant funding has fallen by 18.7 per cent. In the same period, Australia's population has grown by 11.2 per cent. It is no wonder that the States are finding it impossible to continue underwriting the open-ended entitlements of hospital Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two major trends in our community. Public hospital expenditure as a proportion of total expenditure has declined substantially from 34.6 per cent in 1982-83 to 29.67 per cent in 1988-89 and even less today. That trend should dispel any preconceived notion that public hospital expenditure growth has been a major factor in increasing health costs. On the other hand, the States' share of public hospital expenditure has risen from approximately 43 per cent in 1982-83 to 48 per cent in 1989-90, and the indications are that this trend will be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While growth in public hospital costs has been significantly less than growth in other health costs, the States have not gained from this lower cost growth; the gain has gone to the Commonwealth. That has occurred because there has been a major shift of public hospital costs to the States. The result is that the States really are now the major funders of hospital Medicare. While the States have managed to date, it has been at considerable cost to other State government responsibilities. And I thought we were a States House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, States now face fiscal constraints which are so tight that they will be unable to top up public hospital costs due to the Medicare entitlement and decreasing use of public hospital facilities by private patients. The cost of such action in terms of other forgone State public service provisions would be too great. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague Senator Patterson has already spoken about one of the most significant moves in the health sector in recent years&mdash;the Australian Private Hospitals Association and the Australian Hospitals Association banding together in an attempt to have the Federal Government rectify the serious flaws in hospital Medicare. The two organisations represent over 80 per cent of Australia's hospitals. They came together to implement what they called `Operation: Hospital Survival' to convince the Federal Government that major change is needed in Australia's hospital system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a joint statement, the two major hospital groups said that the last two years had seen a decline in Australia's hospital system which could no longer be tolerated. Public hospitals are being asked to provide more services with fewer resources. The demand for public hospital services is increasing dramatically because of the ageing population and the use and availability of high technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The private hospital system, now of the highest quality, is able to access only about one-third of the population. The situation is becoming worse by the day as Australians are forced to give up private health insurance or not to take it up, as the cost of private cover spirals in a time of economic recession. Despite that, 40 per cent of Australians are still insured and 42 per cent of Australians over 65 years of age have hospital insurance. The number of Australians now carrying private insurance has declined from 44.4 per cent only 12 months ago. It is interesting to note that more than two-thirds of them are insured with non-government health funds. This drop effectively means that another half million Australians have been forced to rely on the public hospital system in the last 12 months, adding another $128m to the States' hospital bills. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three fundamental concerns which are shared by the Australian Hospitals Association and the Australian Private Hospitals Association.

Thirdly, the rising cost burden of private health insurance falls unfairly on pensioners and people on low incomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both of those organisations believe that the Federal Government must radically alter the hospital financing system to ensure that pensioners and low income earners remain fully covered by Medicare whilst other Australians meet the full cost of hospital care through private insurance. What do we get from this Government? We get a placebo. We get a minuscule amount of money, no radical restructuring and no alteration of the system. We get more of the same. It is a case of `steady as she sinks'. Both the AHA and the APHA have urged the Federal Government to act quickly before the whole hospital system suffers irreparably. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of our public hospital buildings are a disgrace. The Royal Brisbane Hospital&mdash;the largest in Australia&mdash;conducted a survey to find out how much would need to be spent on the fabric of the place to bring it up to modern-day standards. The result was a bill of $200m. How much is being set aside in the Budget for capital expenditure? I will tell honourable senators&mdash;$30m, and $3m of that is for planning. They are going to plan what to do about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Princess Alexandra Hospital in Brisbane obviously has a fatigued building syndrome problem with an uncoordinated lift system that would not be tolerated in a third world country.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past, Minister Howe has admitted that capital expenditure should be around 8 per cent of recurrent hospital expenditure. It is now around 3 per cent. This has meant an approximate $500m shortfall each year. The true cost of replacement of Australia's public hospital stock has been estimated at $700m annually. The paltry sum of $3m for planning in the 1992-93 Budget and the promise of $23.1m a year over the next five years is ludicrous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Budget document entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Health Care for all Australians </EMPHASIS>has been drawn up and produced by the bureaucracy in order to increase the number of bureaucrats.

<PARA>In other words, `The queues will be just as long or longer but we will change your position in the line because we will put in administrative arrangements to see that that occurs'. The Government spent $50m four years ago to do the same thing. What has happened in that four years? There have been longer queues and longer waiting lists. What has been the effect of $50m being thrown at the problem? There has been no effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Medicare levy increase is a thimble and pea trick. At the same time as $300m more is being taken from taxpayers, they are being put another $13.4 billion into debt. Another way of putting it is that the average taxpayer will be paying $2 a week more in tax and will be borrowing another $32 a week for the pleasure of changing his or her place in the health queue. This is at a time when taxpayers are already paying the interest on a $19,000 per head overseas debt. I believe that the alternative proposed in the Budget last night is a steady-as-she-sinks Medicare system&mdash;another bandaid and transfusion into a moribund, disintegrating health care system which, though in intensive care, will be revived by the mouth to mouth resuscitation and external cardiac massage necessitated and delivered by the Fightback health policy. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's policy in the Fightback program concentrates on a financing formula which seems to have very little to do with actual health care systems whereas the structural reforms which have been gradually designed over the last few years by Labor governments are developing and strengthening what is already a very fine public health system. Ours is a health policy, not a financing policy. Medicare gives rights and entitlements to all Australian citizens. Most Australians understand very well their entitlements in relation to their general practitioner care, because the vast majority periodically have need of that care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is uncertainty abroad about hospital Medicare. As has been raised in our Estimates committees&mdash;Senator Herron and Senator Walters will recall this&mdash;people on the whole do not understand the hospital system because few of them require to go to hospitals. In many cases, they go in as private patients when they have the option, if they wish, to go in as public patients. As has just been stated by Senator Herron, this confusion probably accounts for the vast majority of low income earners who take out private insurance in their confused state of mind about the availability of care. We are very conscious of the need to reassure these people and the rest of the community of their entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Several references have been made this afternoon to the development of a charter of rights for patients in our public hospital system. This is probably overdue and something which will be welcomed by very many people.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People's access to hospital care and/or procedures should not be on the basis of their financial situation but on clinical criteria. Senator Herron seemed to think that this was a very strange way to go. I am afraid that I cannot agree with him. He seemed to insist that this would do nothing whatsoever to reduce waiting lists. Clinical criteria certainly identifies the patients who should have priority, but there are many other ways in which the assistance being provided by the Federal Government may make it easier for hospitals to reduce their waiting lists. It does not take a great deal of imagination to agree that, in many cases, maybe more staff or day surgery is required, the introduction of day surgery where none has been undertaken is necessary and that beds can be contracted out to the private system where we hear there are empty beds&mdash;though I understand that in many cases there are fewer than there have been in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the attention of the Senate to a number of extremely important elements in our restructuring of hospital care&mdash;hospital care being just one part of the health system. These matters have been raised in the Senate before, but perhaps a little reminder will not go astray. I make these comments in view of the fact that we know there will be an increase of 29 per cent in public hospital admissions in the next decade and that many health reforms we are introducing will be paid for by the increase in the levy. As has been pointed out by Senator Herron, the levy certainly does not pay for Medicare; the public pays for it. I do not think that will come as a surprise to most people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some reference has been made to waiting list management. In 1992-93, $50m will be available, and $20.9m available in the following year, to increase the number of patients treated and to achieve targeted reductions and better waiting list management procedures and performance monitoring. Public hospitals will not have to wait for another year for some assistance in moving towards the other innovations to which I have referred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An amount of $3m will be allotted to help the States manage their capital stock better and to shift health services to where they are most needed. In many cases, it is a matter of maldistribution rather than a sheer lack of facilities. A further $116m will be allotted over the following five years. Not every case of maldistribution will need a vast amount of funding to fix it. In many cases, it will simply mean better design and better management. A substantial proportion of these funds will be allocated to capital works in the mental health sector. As was remarked upon earlier today, we have for the first time a national mental health policy in Australia. This will be implemented over the next six years. Once again, this could only come about because of the cooperation of the State governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the mental health program, there will be a considerable need for increased accommodation for mental health patients being moved out of institutions. This is where this plan melds very neatly with the availability of funding from the better cities program, to make sure that proper planning goes into the location of these patients in communities to the benefit of the individuals concerned and not to the detriment of the communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Area health management is a principle accepted by most of the State governments, including the Western Australian Government, which has a pilot project operating at the moment in three areas.

Demonstration projects are being conducted all over the nation. These are also getting assistance in financial terms from the Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clinical budgeting will occur and again there will be demonstration projects showing how devolving budgets within hospitals to clinical units might lead to better health care decisions and more effective use of resources. This is what we have been talking about with the State governments for some years now. We have talked about the better use of resources and not just extra dollars. Many of the hospital administrators&mdash;even those who took part in the exercise to which Senator Herron referred&mdash;admit that it is not extra money they need. They need better management, the capacity to make a different range of decisions and assistance, sometimes financial, but not only financial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as case mix development is concerned, I am sure you will remember, Madam Acting Deputy President, when we did a review of private nursing homes and private hospitals that we did a study on diagnostic related groups.

This will ensure that there is that communication between the services, that services are used most appropriately, that elderly people are not forced to stay in hospital after recovering from acute episodes and they are able to find more appropriate supportive care where it is needed. Multipurpose services to deal with the needs of remote areas will be provided and general practice has also been referred to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have to say that the only things we have been offered in the Opposition's policy simply do not add up to reforms. They do not add up to even a cursory approach to reforming the system. The Opposition gives a financing formula which will reduce our excellent system of health insurance to something resembling the inequitable United States system. By comparison with this Government's plans, the Opposition would deprive the public system of $8 billion over five years. According to its own Fightback program, $1.3 billion less per year would be spent on the public hospital system. Obviously, under that policy&mdash;if honourable senators opposite have the opportunity to implement it and I certainly hope that they never do&mdash;the public system would also be missing out on the $1.6 billion that this Government has guaranteed to the system over the next five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, Commonwealth outlays on health would rise by an estimated $395m per annum on 1991-92 prices. That amount is just Commonwealth outlays and the total national expenditure on health would blow out at a great rate because of the enormously inflationary effects of giving carte blanche to dictate to doctors and private insurance companies. Fees could be dictated by doctors because their own recommended schedule would effectively be underwritten by private insurance and there would be no limit. There would be no cap and in fact the sky would be the limit as to what would be charged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an example, the schedule fee for a standard GP consultation would rise from $23.50 to at least $31. All those people who had been forced into the private system and persuaded to take out basic table insurance would find that it did not even cover their bed charge. At the moment the daily benefits available under the basic table average $185, yet bed, day and other charges in private hospitals average $335 a day. Even insured patients would have to find a considerable amount of money. They will continue to use public hospitals and the whole system will be in enormous disarray if ever the coalition plan is implemented. By no stretch of the imagination can this Opposition manifesto be anything more than a financing formula, and a bad formula at that.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

As I say, the Government has recognised the problem of access. For years it has acknowledged that. In his election speech in 1987, Mr Hawke, then Prime Minister, gave $25m to overcome the hospital queues. What happened in the 1988-89 Budget? The Government decided to give a bit more.

<PARA>What happened to the $25m that was to do away with hospital queues in 1987 that, in the next year's Budget of 1988-89, the Government felt it had to put another $3,000m into shortening hospital queues again? Is it not time that the Government learnt that it cannot keep throwing money at a failed system, and that it has to look at the reasons for its failure and overcome those reasons?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1988-89, and since Mr Hawke's speech of 1987, what has happened? Hospitals have continued the go down the drain and have continued to close hospital beds, and the waiting lists have got longer. Between Bob Hawke's promise of that $25m, and the conclusion of that Budget year with the provision of the additional $3,000m&mdash;all to stop the waiting lists&mdash;those waiting lists in Western Australia grew by 47 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I look at New South Wales and the latest figures there, I come to Senator Crowley's Senate Select Committee on Health Legislation and Health Insurance. In 1991, that Committee was told there were 75,000 Australians at any one time on the waiting lists of public hospitals. Let us look at New South Wales. In New South Wales in 1990, 23,196 people were booked on the waiting list. A year later, there was a 4.3 per cent increase. As for the waiting times, there was a 10.5 per cent increase in the number of those who were waiting six months or more. Not only were the queues extended, but also the waiting times increased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is this Government's response to that? Throw more money in.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would think the Government would have learned in 1987; one would think it had learned in 1988-89; but again, in 1992-93, we get the same old response, `We'll throw more money in'. This time it is putting in, as Senator Herron said, $3m just to plan the deal. One would have thought the Government would have learnt. But, no. It has not learnt. It has allocated $3m just to plan how it is going to spend this extra money from the Medicare levy increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is going to be the result of this increase? Right from the beginning we have had Dr Blewett saying that there would not be an increase. On 10 August this year he said there would not be an increase. Bob Hawke said, `It would only hurt the low income people'. But there we are, we still have the increase coming in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are really hitting the poor and the pensioners.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know whether Senator Crowley and Senator Giles realise that there are presently 316,000 people on an income of less than $160 a week&mdash;that is, less than $8,320 per year&mdash;subscribing to private health care schemes. There are 316,800 who, on an income of $8,000-odd, say, `Medicare is not good enough for me. I am terrified I will not be able to get into hospital when I want to', and 23 per cent of that group of people on that income privately insure. How they do it, I do not know. How do they struggle to pay their private health costs?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have 28.6 per cent of people on an income of $12,428. That is not a big income; that is a very low income. They also struggle to pay their private health care costs. Indeed, there are 2,293,600 health card holders privately insured because, for them, Medicare is not good enough. They are terrified of being left out. It is appalling, and this Government says that it has compassion. Compassion? It would not know what it was about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government has said, `We will agree with the ACTU that we will give an increase of $10 a week to low income earners'. Does anyone know what that does? That makes those low income earners eligible to pay the Medicare levy. A family presently on $24,270 and presently not paying any levy, given its generous $10 a week by the Government and the unions, will be paying $104 in Medicare levy per year. The people on $24,300 a year presently paying $6 a year levy will be paying $110 when they get their $10 a week increase. Not much left out of their increase, is there? Yet we had Senator Crowley publicly saying the other day that low income earners will not be affected by the increase. What hypocrisy. These low income earners who are being given the $10 a week will be put into the levy paying bracket and they will be paying this levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why can the Government not see that it does not work? The aim, of course, is to get rid of the private system. We have had the Jenny Macklin report and it has been a concerted effort all the way down the line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under our policy, we will retain Medicare for all who want it. We will make sure that the low income earners if, and only if, they wish to insure, will be assisted. We will give all those single people over 65&mdash;this does not only cope with those who already believe Medicare does not deal with their circumstance and who struggle to privately insure&mdash;earning under $12,000 $400 dollars, and we will give $800 to those married people who earn under $14,500 to help them pay for their private insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we do similar things for all low income earners, not only those aged over 65. Although I am running out of time, I would like to press home carefully the ideology of the Government. The Government says, `Give everyone equal hospital treatment'. But what it does is give that treatment to the wealthy. We will not encourage the wealthy to use Medicare. We will say to the wealthy, `If you do not privately insure, if you do not get out of the public hospital system'&mdash;and that applies to honourable senators opposite&mdash;`and allow for a pensioner, then you will be levied and you will have to pay dearly for it'. Those opposite who do not privately insure take from the pensioners and the low income groups so that they go to the bottom of the list. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A very interesting point is raised in this very same <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document. It is often argued that one will be able to do all the sorts of things the Opposition claims by moving private patients to private hospitals with private insurance because there are lots of private beds out there. However, some people have been arguing with me over the radio in recent times that there is not much spare capacity in private hospitals. Opposition senators had better make up their minds because, according to their document, private hospitals have an average occupancy rate of only 55 per cent to 60 per cent. The Opposition knows full well that the beds are out there. They are underutilised, not necessarily because people are moving away from private insurance but because under the previous Liberal Government there were too many beds built in the late 1970s and early 1980s when there was a quick dollar in private health and private hospitals. That is absolutely true because the figures from that same report Senator Walters quoted show that in private hospitals there has been more occupancy and more services under Medicare than before. That is pretty hard to deal with, Senator Patterson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Patterson got it wrong about Minister Brian Howe. He is quite right to say that there is no point in throwing money at things if one does not do the necessary structural adjustment. He has done that. That is why it is now reasonable to postulate raising the levy once those structural rearrangements, particularly the restructuring of general practice, were in place. Senator Patterson knows, as well as I do, that she was selectively quoting. I will not get too upset about that&mdash;it is par for the course in here&mdash;but some Opposition senators were getting upset about it earlier. So I am perfectly prepared to try to play that game too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Herron and Senator Patterson wanted to know what happened when we spent $50m on waiting lists. At least Senator Herron has the grace, I am sure, to know the answer&mdash;the numbers on the waiting lists dropped. The $50m made a significant difference to the waiting lists. The number of people waiting on those lists fell because that money could be targeted to buying the services of specialists, buying new operating theatres and buying specialists' staff. The only thing we did not need to provide were beds. We have too many beds in this country. Everybody who really knows about health care knows that. Senator Herron would certainly know it. We have far too many beds and most of them are in the private sector, where under the Fightback package there would be no restraint on how they were used or what their supply was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The public hospital systems in our States, instead of being bagged and charged with `being in crisis stage' by the Opposition, should be acknowledged for the very great efficiencies that they have achieved.

About 50 per cent of those come in as accidents and emergencies&mdash;in old-fashioned language, casualties. They are dealt with within 24 hours&mdash;in effect, straightaway. If one looks at the other 50 per cent one sees that about 49.7 or 49.8 per cent are treated within two weeks. About 25,000 patients throughout the whole of New South Wales&mdash;and Senator Walters confirms those figures&mdash;are on that waiting list. I concur that the concern is not the number of people on the waiting list but the time people have to wait. I agree that waiting for six months to a year, particularly when that is getting towards the year, for many procedures is not acceptable. That is why the Government is seriously addressing, yet again, the problem of trying to reduce waiting lists. </PARA>

Do not come in here and tell me what is bad about Medicare when they will keep it. I know why they are going to keep it: because it is so good. </PARA>

<PARA>This issues paper concerns fees, commissions, charges and disclosure in the superannuation industry. It is therefore an important starting point in any examination of the matter of fees, charges and commissions. It is a synthesis of a substantial amount of evidence which has been placed, both orally and in writing, before the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. Whilst this paper has given rise to much media comment and speculation on the manner of disclosure by agents of their commission, it also gives the reader a better understanding of a number of other issues which are critical to the development of a sound, long term retirement incomes policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first is that the level of fees, charges and commissions always has the potential to detract from final superannuation benefits. Along with the taxation of superannuation contributions, income and benefits, it can play, in some cases, a devastating role. Superannuation funds, in any economic environment, tread a fine line yielding positive returns on the one hand and not covering rates of inflation on the other. It is often the level of fees, charges, commissions and taxes, coupled with the less than spectacular funds management, which force a fund into a negative return. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The most recent ASFA <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Superfunds</EMPHASIS> journal, which surveyed major superannuation funds, provides little more joy. This survey revealed that a 20-year rolling average of return of around 2.9 per cent was normal for funds under survey. The magnitude of imposts and charges on superannuation contributions can be gauged by looking at one of the critical elements of the industry: personal superannuation as sold by life agents. Statistics provided by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission indicate that in 1990 almost $1.3 billion in agency commissions was paid. That represented an average of about 20 per cent of funds deposited with the industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having been briefed by representatives of both the Life Insurance Federation of Australia&mdash;LIFA&mdash;and the agents, I am prepared to state that the agents have a key role to play as financial advisers and that they are entitled to a reasonable payment for their services. But what concerns me is that in recent times early cancellations have been reported to be running at a rate of something like 24 per cent for those policyholders who have taken out a policy within the last two years. A figure of 78 per cent for cancellations in late 1991 has also been reported. Given that most personal superannuation policies have front-end loaded agency commissions, most of those who cancelled would not have been refunded anything like the value of their contributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This seems extraordinarily wasteful, given that no long term retirement funds have been accumulated and also that over $3 billion worth of tax concessions, some of which are allocated to personal superannuation, are given to promote a retirement incomes policy. Therefore, I am left to wonder what the rate of policy cancellations will be now that the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) has issued his fiat which has, with the exception of a $100 net incentive, abolished rebates for award-plus superannuation. My office has received a significant number of calls protesting against this retrospective tax measure. I trust that the Government will ultimately see the error of its ways and restore this tax incentive, at least allowing those polices in force to continue receiving favourable tax treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Returning to the document before the Senate, I alert honourable senators to the sections which point to the need for greater consumer awareness of the various product types and the charges which relate to each. How many of us, if confronted by glossy, small print and very technical advertising and contractual information, could distinguish between the following features: establishment and investment management fees; asset fees and switching fees; renewal commissions and early termination charges? It is very difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Too often the consumer, in sheer exasperation, signs a contract and suffers the consequences later. The report canvasses a number of options for reform which I hope are given due consideration by the industry, consumer groups and government agencies. The questions are: should agents have to disclose and what should they disclose? Should the Insurance and Superannuation Commission play a more pro-active consumer role or should self-regulation prevail? Should commissions be amortised or capped? What regulation of agents is needed to clean up sections of the industry which chase the fast dollar rather than sell products to consumers in a caring client oriented manner?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are questions to which I seek real answers. I trust that in the coming months the Committee members, who are represented in the chamber at the moment, will come to a well considered common position on these matters and that future retirees will be better off as a consequence. I commend the paper to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before closing these remarks, I commend the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner, Mr Beetham, on his decision to open offices in each of the State capitals. It has been a matter of some concern for those people in the outlying States who have to contact Melbourne, Sydney or even Canberra. Telephone access has been a problem for accountants and people with other interests in the superannuation industry. Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity of complimenting the Commissioner on this forward step. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to say a few words in the absence of the Chairman of the Select Committee on Superannuation, Senator Sherry. I have listened with interest to the remarks of my colleague Senator Watson. I think he has fairly extensively covered a number of the major issues in the paper. It ought to be clear&mdash;although one could be forgiven for believing otherwise from some of the press reports&mdash;that this is only an options paper and does not make recommendations. It urges all interested parties to contribute to a public debate which ought to take place over the coming months. It will be a very valuable exercise because, quite clearly, there are considerable levels of concern, as we know from the submissions received by the Committee and from talking to various people in the community, about whether products are value for money. It is fair to say that the industry itself recognises the need to ensure that public confidence is maintained. As a result, the decision by LIFA to opt for full disclosure of fees and charges is a very good step.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The vexed question is whether commissions ought to be disclosed. At this stage, I would take the view that as long as consumers are made aware in advance of signing up for the product of what the surrender value is at various stages, they are in a position to make an informed judgment. It is therefore not necessary for them to know precisely who is getting what any more than the average consumer who buys a motor vehicle knows what the agent's commission is. Often it is not only a well-kept secret but also it is one that is particularly sensitive in a commercial sense. I do not see the need for consumers to know that level of detail. They ought to know whether they are getting value for money. I think they can do that by and large by being made aware of surrender values. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not throw my hands up in the air in the same way as some people do to discover that there are high levels of commission up-front, although the amount of the commission up-front may well be an independent matter for concern. The mere fact that it may not be very good value if one surrenders a policy within a couple of years does not automatically prove that it is not good value because the whole purpose of the exercise ought to be that one is in it for the long term. There may be some circumstances in which one has to cash it in but one ought to do that in the knowledge that the benefit of compounding will be forfeited and one is not likely to get much back by cancelling prematurely. Therefore, these things have to be sensibly judged over the period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Up-front commissions have fallen quite considerably in recent years. I think that is a result of a combination of factors&mdash;probably more competition in the industry and a realisation that the more one takes up-front, the less commitment there may well be down the track in terms of servicing the customer and also the more one deprives the capital sum of the opportunities for compounding. I would have thought it would probably be more sensible to spread that commission payment over a period in order to meet both of those concerns. I think there is certainly room for negotiation in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the day there has been a very high level of multipartisanship on the Committee.

The basic proposition that he made was that in a number of areas the Committee, particularly in the safeguarding superannuation report, has come up with a number of very useful recommendations which are designed to ensure that not only does the industry retain its integrity but also that consumers are protected. This report similarly brings together a number of important concerns and addresses them in such a way that we are capable of achieving a fairly high level of consensus.

In order to do that, one ought to be entitled to a commission if successful. A number of the suggestions in that report will prove very useful in moving towards that consensus which I hope emerges in the not too distant future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I intend to be brief as well. We have seen yet another of what Senator Alston called a useful report from a very useful Committee&mdash;the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. This issues paper deals with one of the really important issues that came from many witnesses who appeared before us&mdash;that is, the issue of fees, commissions, charges and disclosure. I believe that the many case studies outlined in this report clearly indicate that consumers are confused, understandably so, about the whole issue of superannuation. Often they do not know what they have entered into until a dispute arises and they see the fine print or they have the explanation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our Committee has outlined a number of options for reform, including the capping of fee levels. We have had so much evidence about the erosion of the small nest egg by the size of the administration fee eating away year after year. This applies particularly to women in the work force who may leave and return to the work force from time to time to find in the meantime that the nest egg they have accumulated has been eroded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another option for reform includes the disclosure of agents' commissions. I fully endorse that recommendation. If it is to be enacted, it will lead the way for radical reform in this industry, which has virtually been left untouched. Now that it is a growth industry and now that it is of vital concern to the majority of Australians, it is very important that we have the opportunity to have a close look at the way it operates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Something else we would like to see and which I endorse is simplified documentation so that no longer can the industry hide behind the jargon, or what I would call the obfuscation, of differing documentation so that consumers cannot make an across-the-board product comparison. I regard superannuation as similar to any other product. Consumers have a right to access basic understandable information so that they can make an informed choice. This has not been possible in the area of superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not support the view that people only need to know the aggregate. I believe they need to know the components of agents' fees and commissions so that they can see whether an agent who is tied to a particular financial institution, for example, may have a vested interest in promoting one product above another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report has brought together a number of issues and problems. It is for public and industry debate. When that debate occurs, I think it will greatly assist the Committee in its job of reaching its final recommendations by the end of this year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This paper addresses two of the Committee's 17 terms of reference, namely, (g) and (h). The Committee agreed that, having regard to the sensitivity of the fees, charges and commissions subject, it was appropriate that a consolidation of the evidence received by the Committee should be carried out and that a series of options for reform should be identified to allow consumer groups, industry players and government agencies to further submit their views before the Committee decides on its final recommendation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The paper is a landmark document in that it is the first attempt, in recent times at least, to bring together, in a comprehensive and detailed way, the various views on fees, charges and commissions relating to superannuation. The Committee envisages that during the next two months it will further consider the matter and make recommendations in its third and final report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As can be gauged by reading the issues paper, the Committee has received substantial evidence on this aspect of its terms of reference. Unfortunately, however, the evidence has been significantly&mdash;at times extremely&mdash;polarised and the Committee is faced with the task of making very difficult decisions as a consequence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators will recall that during the autumn sittings the Committee presented an interim report on its work on these terms of reference and in so doing expressed a concern that the Life Insurance Federation of Australia, commonly known as LIFA, had not fully cooperated with the Committee in submitting company by company details of fees, charges and commissions. I am pleased to inform the Senate that the Committee has received this information for each of the LIFA board member companies and that this has been followed up with an intensive in camera hearing during which productive discussions occurred. These developments have greatly assisted the Committee's understanding of the complex issues which underpin fees, charges and commissions in superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the Committee's establishment, a number of other agencies have been conducting similar and/or parallel inquiries into the subject. To this end, the Trade Practices Commission, the National Community Affairs Advisory Council and the Australian Law Reform Commission have also been looking at aspects of fees, charges and commissions in the superannuation industry. The distinct difference between the Committee's inquiry and those I have just identified is that the Committee has terms of reference which are global in their orientation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has already inquired into and reported on the supply side of the superannuation equation; that is, how a dynamic, competitive and thereby efficient environment can be created which will deliver value for money superannuation and roll-over products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The paper contains a series of case studies from a consumer's or demand viewpoint which identify some of the weaknesses of current sales and marketing of superannuation. What is needed is greater consumer awareness, more easily understood product descriptions and changes to disclosure which ensure that all consumers know what they are committing themselves to when they agree to enter into a superannuation contract. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is with these overarching principles in mind that the Committee has floated the following options for reform: capping fee levels, consumer education specific to superannuation; standardised documentation; standardised disclosure requirements and terminology; regulatory reform to give teeth to existing disclosure requirements and guidelines; longer cooling off periods; mandatory disclosure of agent commissions; amortising commissions; and rules which make agents disclose the companies and products they respectively represent and sell. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The document is aptly named for a number of reasons, one of which is the way in which it has generated a supercharged debate on whether there should be disaggregated disclosure of agent commissions. Life officers and agents alike oppose disclosure of commissions, whereas consumers believe that it is the right of consumers to know how much their agent is being paid for selling regular premium or roll-over superannuation. I should emphasise as Chairman of the Committee that I have not come to a final conclusion on that and will still determine my particular view based on the ongoing submissions and evidence that we are receiving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an emerging concern that, unless there are considerable efficiencies achieved in the personal superannuation product domain, some consumers will not be able to accumulate levels of superannuation to ensure a secure retirement. If media coverage of this matter is any guide, it would appear that the community strongly believes that full disaggregated disclosure should occur. However, whilst this would normally be an extremely persuasive factor in taking a decision in this direction, the Committee will first need to canvass the full gamut of responses to the issues paper. For example, one argument against disclosure is that if laws are passed making it mandatory, unresolved questions remain. For example, should disclosure take account of agent bonuses, agent travel and expenses, and agent salaries? Unless such <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> legislation is carefully worded, many loopholes would exist which would facilitate avoidance of disclosure provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The life industry believes that a total up-front disclosure of total fees, charges, commissions, et cetera is all that is needed and, to its credit, that is a substantial movement and change in view of the last few years. Likewise, even this solution needs clarification. For example, would this total be expressed in present value terms or some meaningless future value which would not take into account the impact of inflation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This week marks the conclusion of one year's operation of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. During this time the Committee has, in some form or other, reported its progress on six separate occasions. It has adopted this policy because it believes that, in the fast moving superannuation environment in which Australia finds itself, it is of critical importance that all senators as well as all persons in the community be as up to date as possible on the main game of superannuation as played by their Select Committee on Superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The idea that select committees should report frequently during an extended inquiry is, I believe, preferable to handing down a single holy grail document on the final day of the Committee's life. Often these documents have been overtaken by government and community initiatives and therefore, at best, give only a potted history of developments in the field of inquiry. Moreover, frequent and meaningful reporting of activities can serve as an ongoing measure of performance of a committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the paper to fellow senators. There certainly has been significant community demand for copies of this paper. I believe that it is an interesting and informative document which will advance the development of a sound retirement incomes policy. I also place on record the Committee's appreciation of the work of the secretariat staff, particularly Alistair Sands, in assisting senators during this period of the inquiry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for the lunch adjournment I was simply indicating my support for the increased funding for research into sugar growing areas. I mentioned the long history of the sugar industry in research funding and the work that the industry itself has done. I also mentioned my optimism for the future of the sugar industry, particularly in the Mackay, Burdekin and Herbert River areas of Queensland. I indicated that part of my optimism related to the fact that there will be a new Government in power federally as soon as Mr Keating is game enough to call an election. I was indicating that under a new government canefarmers, particularly, as with all farmers and all rural people, would be substantially better off under the coalition's Fightback proposals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said, and I briefly elaborate upon the fact, that the National Farmers Federation has given the coalition's Fightback proposals a very big tick&mdash;a very big endorsement. The Farmers Federation has done the figures; it has calculated how it will affect four particular primary industry groups and, in all cases, those primary industry groups would have a much more profitable outcome than currently exists. In the case of the sugarcane farmers, figures have been used which suggest that&mdash;depending on their size, of course&mdash;they would be between $6,000 and $10,000 a year better off under the Fightback proposals than they are now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As opposed to the Fightback proposals for the sugarcane farmers we have, on the one hand, the Democrats wanting to ban everything, increase the costs of fuel and make life really difficult for the sugar growers. On the other hand, we have the Labor Party which does absolutely nothing for the sugar growers except set up these high profile task forces to run around the sugar electorates in the months before the Federal election with the pretence that they are going to look at something.

But Mr Courtice, in a last gasp attempt to retain that electorate, somehow has talked the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) into setting up some sort of group which Mr Courtice necessarily will chair.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have a brief opportunity also to speak in support of the Sugar Cane Levy Amendment Bill 1992. I was interested to hear my North Queensland colleague, Senator Macdonald, speak about the coalition's policies in relation to the sugar industry. But Senator Macdonald did not say what they are. The people of North Queensland in particular are still unaware of just what they are.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to take the time of the Senate this evening to run through some of the examples of about face by the Leader of the National Party of Australia, Mr Tim Fischer, and the Leader of the Liberal Party of Australia, Dr Hewson, in relation to what those policies might be if in the unlikely event, as Senator Macdonald seems so sure will happen, the coalition is in a position to make these decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 7 May Canegrowers was told by the Leader of the Opposition that, if elected, the coalition's policy was that there would be no special arrangements for Australia's sugar industry and that tariffs would be reduced to zero by the year 2000. Speaking on ABC Radio that day, Ian Ballantyne, the General Manager of Canegrowers, said that Dr Hewson had confirmed that `he would not look at holding a tariff' and that `They would come off on a progressive basis to reach zero'. Dr Hewson's position clearly exposes his coalition partner, the National Party, whose representatives have claimed that the tariff will not be zero but would be `negligible' by the end of the decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot understand why Senator Macdonald is leaving the chamber. Perhaps he is not doing so. I am glad that he is staying to hear why the people in sugar growing areas are so confused about the coalition's policies. On the same day&mdash;7 May&mdash;a media release stated that the National Party Leader, Tim Fischer, had apparently either deliberately attempted to mislead rural Australia in recent statements or the National Party's views seem to have been ignored or overridden by Dr Hewson. In an interview with John Laws, Dr Hewson said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, by negligible&mdash;we say negligible protection&mdash;because protection comes from two sources really. It comes from the tariff, and it comes from the exchange rate. If the exchange rate depreciates, it increases the protection of an industry. . . So in a sense, we say negligible protection because you could have a movement of the exchange rate by as much as 5 per cent or so over that period. But the aim is to eliminate tariffs. But of course the exchange rate movement can still provide protection.</PARA>
<PARA>Madam Acting Deputy President, I do not know whether you know what all that means. This is certainly gobbledegook from Dr Hewson who, frankly, does not understand the sugar industry. This is quite clear from that convoluted statement. But the one clear message that comes through from the interview is&mdash;and I repeat it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But the aim is to eliminate tariffs.</PARA>
<PARA>There was then a little bit of quiet for a couple of months. Ray Braithwaite had to resign his position because of total confusion and an inability to be able to focus on the coalition's policies in relation to the sugar industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 17 July we had another statement&mdash;this time from Tim Fischer. What did Tim Fischer say this time? In an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> under the heading `Fischer Predicts Policy Shift', it is claimed that `according to. . . Mr Fischer', the Federal National Party Leader, Dr Hewson has been convinced by the coalition that the Fightback package needs `adjusting'. Further, the article stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Fischer indicated to the Women's section of the Queensland National Party Conference adjustments would also be made to the timing of tariff reductions in Fightback, which delegates took to mean a slowdown in the phasing out of tariffs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He told the Australian yesterday a Coalition Government would not even begin to reduce tariffs until the rest of the Fightback package was in place, including the goods and services tax&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the canegrowers would love the thought of a goods and services tax&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">industry relations reform and the abolition of payroll and sales taxes and fuel excise.</PARA>
<PARA>That was on 17 July from one of the coalition partners. The views of Dr Hewson were also sought in regard to this matter. The same article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A spokeswomen for Dr Hewson said yesterday she had no knowledge of any proposal to hold back tariff reductions until after all aspects of Fightback had been passed through Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>So there is a clear contradiction between the coalition leaders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 23 July Mr Crean issued a press release which stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Crean called on sugar growers to recall Dr Hewson's response to the CANEGROWERS chairman, Harry Bonnano, and general manager, Ian Ballantyne, when they put to him the growers concerns. . . </PARA>
<PARA>The press release continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Ballantyne said. . . : `We spoke to Mr Fischer and Mr Hewson separately, but in general terms Mr Hewson. . . reconfirmed they would not look at holding a tariff, should they be elected to Government next year, they would not look at holding a tariff at present levels and by that time it would be $55, but they would progressively come off on a straight line basis so if the tariff was at that point at 20 per cent over the next six years or so they would come off on a progressive basis to reach zero. . . they would be adhering strictly to the Fightback package.'</PARA>
<PARA>The press release also contained the following quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`In spite of Dr Hewson's clearly stated position Mr Fischer told the Queensland National Party conference and the media that a Coalition Government would not even begin to reduce tariffs until the rest of the Fightback package was in place. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, all honourable senators would agree just from what has happened in the last few months in one industry&mdash;the sugar industry&mdash;that it is quite clear that the coalition does not understand the rural sector. It certainly does not understand the sugar industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I acknowledge and applaud the coalition's support for this sugar levy amendment Bill, it is quite clear that there are continual contradictions in the ranks of the coalition. I am simply quoting directly from what has been said by Dr Hewson and Tim Fischer. It is quite clear that they do not understand the sugar industry. Coalition members like Senator Macdonald come into this place and pretend to anybody who cares to listen that the coalition has it all sewn up, that it is going to protect the sugar industry. Yet the evidence is in black and white in statements which have been documented. Clearly, the coalition has no inclination to protect the sugar industry. It has no particular policy, except to reduce tariffs to zero. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to support the Bill. I am also pleased that the coalition is at least supporting the Bill.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Every six months or so the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories labours and brings forth a gnat. Once again, we have before the Senate one of these ludicrous ragbags of legislation where the Government either fixes up stupid mistakes which have generally emerged from rushing legislation through at the end of a session, or includes in legislation matters of very little consequence. I simply wonder how much it really costs to put a Bill through this Parliament and why the Government wastes its time with this sort of nonsense rather than making it part of some matter of real substance. Anyway, here we have yet another set of amendments to legislation under the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Arts, Environment and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 seeks to amend five Acts. Three of them relate to the arts and heritage, and I will deal with them first. The first is the Australia Council Act 1975. The amendment that the Government is now proposing, if passed, would enable the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories, rather than the Governor-General, to appoint and accept the resignation of the members of the Council. By the way, the Chairman would still be appointed by the Governor-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I stress that all appointments to bodies similar to the Australia Council are appointed by the Governor-General in Council. That means that the Government makes a recommendation to the Governor-General. People like Senator McMullan have to trot out to Government House and explain to the Governor-General why they want whoever it is appointed to whatever board it is. There are many such organisations, yet here we have suddenly brought into this place a Bill to amend the way we appoint people to just one of those many bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Either the Government has taken a policy decision that it does not want the Governor-General to appoint people to this kind of board&mdash;and if it has taken such a decision, it should apply it to all such bodies&mdash;or it has not taken a decision, and is just having a one-off flight of fancy. It seems to me that the reality is that it is simply another example of this Government being a chaotic organiser. No doubt, in coming months we will find further examples of legislation that someone might decide needs to be changed this way, and the time of the Parliament will be wasted similarly. It just seems extraordinary to me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the Minister whether the Government favours appointments to this sort of body being made by the Governor-General. If it does not, why is it not changing the method of appointment to similar bodies such as the Australian Film Commission, the Australian Heritage Commission, the Australian National Maritime Museum, the Museum of Australia, the Australian National Gallery, the Australian National Library and the Australian Film, Television and Radio School, which all have boards appointed by the Governor-General and which relate to this portfolio?</PARA>

Why it sticks to the inefficient way, I do not know. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will admit that, in reality, appointments are made by the Minister, but in most instances the Minister has to get approval from the Cabinet, particularly in situations involving the Chairman.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next Act is the National Gallery Act 1975. The amendment seeks to change the name of the gallery from the Australian National Gallery to the National Gallery of Australia. No other alterations are to be made. Obviously, this is a matter of enormous substance to somebody. I have spoken to the Director of the National Gallery of Australia&mdash;as she would like it to be called&mdash;and I have a great regard for her. But this seems to me to be a monumental waste of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument put forward is that the new name will be more in keeping with other institutions in the Parliamentary Triangle, such as the National Library of Australia, the National Film and Sound Archive across the lake, the National Museum of Australia and the National Science and Technology Centre. If the view is that we should call these bodies the `National' whatever it is, then I wonder why so recently the Australian Government decided to call the national maritime museum the Australian National Maritime Museum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government has no consistency and no rationality. If it is important not to call something Australian, why did it call the Australian National Maritime Museum the Australian National Maritime Museum? This strikes me as more examples of absolute nonsense coming before this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a problem relating to the National Gallery of Victoria. In future, if this legislation goes through, it is very likely that the National Gallery of Victoria will be confused with the National Gallery of Australia. Both are called the `National Gallery of. . . '. Surely the name `Australian National Gallery' is a far more distinctive and different name from the National Gallery of Victoria. If the Government is seeking to change the name of the Australian National Gallery because&mdash;and this is what was put to me&mdash;at present it is confused with the Victorian gallery because it is called the National Gallery of Victoria, then surely the Government will create even greater confusion by going down this track. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly concern has been expressed to me by some people on the museum staff and people who are close to the gallery that it is presently known throughout the world by its present title. As well as causing changes in Australia, similar alterations would need to be made to reference and trade publications which relate to the Australian National Gallery. The question we should ask is: will the change make the gallery any more efficient or attract more visitors? It is the view of the Director that it will and that it is to its advantage. That is her view. I am afraid it is not mine. She is entitled to her view and the Government is entitled to go to the expense of changing the Act, bringing it through Parliament and changing the stationery, the signage and heaven knows what for some vague and, it seems to me, inconsequential end. I do not think it has any rational purpose and I would need to be persuaded that there is a net benefit in changing the name from the Australian National Gallery to the National Gallery of Australia.

The word `Australian' seems to me to be an important word and I would like to see it up in front of the names of bodies like these.

Other countries may take the view that they would like to have the word `national' up front. I want the word `Australian' up front. Unless there is a damn good reason for changing it, I cannot see why we should lose the word `Australian' at the front of the names of these bodies&mdash;just as the Australian National Maritime Museum, which is a recent creation by this Government, has it.

One concerns the National Capital Planning Authority. Clause 5 of this Bill amends the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988, the National Land Ordinance 1989 and the Reserved Laws (Administration) Ordinance 1989 to enable the National Capital Planning Authority, with the approval of the Minister, to manage on behalf of the Commonwealth national land which is used or intended to be used for the special purposes of Canberra as the national capital. </PARA>

That is the only concern we have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the other matters in this ragbag, we have no basic objections, even though this kind of omnibus Bill to fix things  up  really</PARA>

This one relates to the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act and it increases the value of contracts which the Director of Parks and Wildlife may enter into from $100,000 to $250,000. This is consistent with increases already approved for other statutory authorities in the DASET portfolio. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) It is unclear from the quotation attributed to Mr Miller whether the reference was to State or Commonwealth legislation.  As the honourable senator will be aware, primary responsibility for wildlife conservation and management rests with State and Territory Governments.  Commonwealth legislation relevant to wildlife conservation includes the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975, the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982 and the Whale Protection Act 1980.  The Federal Government has specific responsibilities for import and export controls on wildlife and for ensuring Australia observes its obligations under international treaties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Koala habitat is broadly distributed throughout Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia.  Nature conservation reserves in these States protect substantial areas of koala habitat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3)(a) The Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service within my portfolio has provided funding to assist with the gathering of data and the development of koala management plans in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia through the Koala Conservation Program and the States Cooperative Assistance Program.  Draft management plans have been completed by Queensland and Victoria, and are currently being developed by New South Wales and South Australia. Copies of the draft plans for Queensland and Victoria have been forwarded to the honourable senator and additional copies are available from the Senate Table Office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3)(b) The existing national parks and nature reserves in eastern Australia effectively protect substantial areas of koala habitat and are managed by the State and Territory conservation agencies.  Ultimately the long-term conservation of the koala will depend on the protection offered by these reserves in combination with conservation measures outside reserves. Programs funded by the Commonwealth Government such as Save the Bush, One Billion Trees and the States Cooperative Assistance Program are important to maintaining and improving habitat outside reserves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The statement from Mr Miller's letter that 'A huge amount of work has been done to study the koala and its medical problems' is a generic reference to research on the biology of koalas since their initial discovery rather than work conducted solely by governments.  Through the Koala Conservation Program, launched in 1985, over $800,000 from Commonwealth funding, public contributions and a donation from American Express International, has been provided to administer and conduct high priority research projects through the Research and Surveys, Save the Bush, and States Cooperative Assistance Programs.  The research projects include investigations on Chlamydiosis (a bacterial borne disease which is widely distributed in koala populations), diet, habitat utilisation and identification of important remnant habitat areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) and (6) The National Koala Survey, a component of the Koala Conservation Program, aimed to identify the broad distribution of koalas in Australia to assess their current status and changes in historical distribution.  The survey did not aim to assess population size in local areas or nation-wide.  The surveys in New South Wales and Queensland indicated that the broad historical distribution of the koala was stable, despite some local declines, and that the greatest concentrations of koalas occurred in the northeast New South Wales-southeast Queensland region.  In the southern states of South Australia and Victoria the current distribution on the mainland is largely the result of translocation of animals from locally overstocked populations on Kangaroo Island and French Island.  These translocation efforts have been so successful that koalas are now re-established throughout much of the remaining suitable habitat in their former range.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) Koalas have been exported to 3 US zoos; San Diego, San Francisco and Los Angeles.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8)(a) It is known that koalas have been born at San Diego, San Francisco and Los Angeles zoos.  It is not known whether they have been born at other zoos in the USA.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) Details of such programs throughout eastern and southern Australia are not held by my portfolio.  However koalas benefit from projects which seek to improve wildlife habitat generally.  Such projects may be funded through Federal Government programs such as Save the Bush and One Billion Trees.  Much voluntary work is also undertaken locally to improve koala habitat.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Reduction of carbon dioxide levels has been addressed by the Government in its decision in October 1990 to adopt an interim planning target of stabilising emissions of greenhouse gases (including carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide etc), based on 1988 levels, by the year 2000, and reducing these emissions by 20% by 2005. As part of that decision, it was also determined that Australia would not proceed with the adoption of response measures which have net adverse economic impacts nationally, or on Australia's trade competitiveness, in the absence of similar action by major greenhouse gas producing countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Government has taken steps to reduce carbon dioxide levels in the decision, endorsed by the States and Territories, to develop a National Greenhouse Response Strategy (NGRS).  The Strategy will be based on the interim planning target and a major component will be positive measures for limiting emissions of all greenhouse gases. Joint Commonwealth, State and Territory activity this year has resulted in production of the document The Draft National Greenhouse Response Strategy&mdash;A discussion paper. This was released and widely distributed for public comment on 30 June 1992. It is proposed that the first phase of the NGRS will be completed by late 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A report titled "Programs Implemented and Policies Adopted Since 1988 that Contribute to Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Australia", prepared by the Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council (ANZECC), summarises measures that are already under way to reduce Australia's greenhouse gas emissions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The NGRS will identify measures for auditing and reporting on greenhouse gas emissions. Specifically, part of the Strategy will involve the development and implementation of a national greenhouse gas emissions inventory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The Industry Commission study into the Costs and Benefits of Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions (1991), pointed out that, if there are rises in factors such as income, consumption levels, and population growth over time, greenhouse gas emissions per capita would need to be reduced further than if these conditions did not hold, in order that the emissions level remains constant.</PARA>
