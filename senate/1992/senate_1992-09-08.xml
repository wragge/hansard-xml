<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and concerns Cambodia. I refer to statements purportedly made by the Minister to journalists in Indonesia last week, including that the Khmer Rouge is unlikely to rejoin the peace process and that options in Cambodia include sanctions against the Khmer Rouge, isolating it in the zones it controls or pulling out of the peacekeeping operation altogether. As these expressions are fundamentally at odds with everything the Minister has said in this chamber regarding the peace process, I ask: what is now the position of the Australian Government? Is the Paris agreement to be revised, and, if so, by what means? Is the United Nations Security Council to revise its mandate for the UN force presently in Cambodia? How does the Minister justify the breach of his undertaking to keep the Parliament fully informed?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="481" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a little difficult to keep the Parliament fully informed when the Parliament is not sitting at a time when events are rapidly developing. And events have been rapidly developing over the last few weeks while I and a number of other people intimately concerned with this process have been, and still are, doing our best to work a way through that meets the basic objective&mdash;which I take it we all still agree with&mdash;which is securing a lasting and durable peace for the people of Cambodia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The premise on which that peace was originally constructed was one of a necessity to create an environment in which free and fair elections could be held and in which an end could be reached to the civil war that had been tearing the country apart&mdash;a civil war precipitated and sustained by a Khmer Rouge acting not just on its own resources but with very substantial supply from outside, conspicuously from China; a situation where other external countries were equally giving military support to other players on the ground; and a situation where the United Nations was unable to play any constructive role in assisting the electoral process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The peace plan that was constructed, built on an Australian initiative, was aimed at creating the conditions where the civil war could end and elections could take place under United Nations auspices. It was necessary to craft a plan of that kind in order to detach the Khmer Rouge from its external sources of supply. It was necessary to craft a plan of that kind in order to take the external countries that were supplying the internal participants and warring factions out of the play.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without a plan of the kind that we initiated and that was subsequently put into place, we would be now exactly where we were two years ago, with 350,000 people still sitting in border camps, unlike the present situation where nearly 150,000 of them have either voluntarily or under UNHCR auspices come back into Cambodia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would have a situation where there would be no reduction in the military activity that was then occurring at very high levels. We would have a situation where there was no prospect of any kind of exercise in electoral testing that could have taken place in any remotely free and fair way. In other words, we would have had a continuation of the civil war. That civil war has come to an end. It has come to an end as a result of the implementation of that peace plan. The United Nations is there; 16,000 troops are there; many electoral officers are there. A civil administration and monitoring operation is in place. A human rights monitoring organisation under UN auspices is in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation has fundamentally improved, but it is an extraordinarily fragile situation. It is an extraordinarily difficult situation. It is a situation that we knew all along would not proceed to fruition, the result of free and fair elections and a permanent end to civil war, without there being many difficulties along the way. We have struck one of those difficulties. We have run into a significant non-cooperation by the Khmer Rouge.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Hill" NAMEID="BH4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator Hill</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Surprise, surprise!</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;`Surprise', says Senator Hill, smiling away at what he thinks will serve him electorally in some way. I find it nothing short of disgusting that there should be this cynicism directed towards this process by Senator Hill who has done nothing constructive at any stage of the whole process to bring it about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a situation where there is non-cooperation by the Khmer Rouge. We have a situation where attempts have been made to identify legitimate grounds for concern by the Khmer Rouge&mdash;and there were some&mdash;about the kind of civil administration that was in place and the kind of playing field that was being maintained by the UN organisation. We have a situation where attempts have been made to meet those legitimate concerns and those attempts are continuing. But very real doubt now exists, not only in my mind but also in the minds of many of the people that I have been talking to over the last two or three weeks&mdash;that includes just about all the relevant players and all the relevant Foreign Ministers&mdash;as to whether it will be possible for the Khmer Rouge to come back into the settlement in its present operational form.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do we do about it? Do we sit back and smugly giggle, as Senator Hill does, because there may be some perceived difficulty in this process which may be able to be characterised as some sort of lapse on the part of the good efforts of all those people around the world who have been trying hard to put this process into place; or do we try to work a way through this? What I am trying to do, what everybody else is trying to do, and what I will be doing in Bangkok from tonight for the next three days when I go up there for the APEC meeting and many discussions on this topic on the sidelines to it, is find a way through this which actually works, which is consistent with the original terms of the settlement and which is consistent with the longer term objective, which is to stop a civil war.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of options that do suggest themselves, and I have indicated publicly what those options are. I have put the options in terms of United Nations sanctions and I have put the options in terms of a quarantining exercise within the existing settlement. That would involve the electoral process continuing and, obviously, some modification of the military strategy, while not seeking for the UN to go into the Khmer Rouge areas which occupy 15 per cent of the landscape and about 200,000 people of the total population of seven million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the option of a UN confrontation of the Khmer Rouge in an attempt to establish a military presence on the ground, and there is the option of complete withdrawal from the situation at this stage. Nobody wants to withdraw from the situation. Everybody wants to see the electoral process maintained. Everybody wants to see the avoidance of a renewal of military conflict. It is my belief that several options are possible, short of UN withdrawal, but nonetheless still premised on the possibility of Khmer Rouge non-cooperation. They are options that can be pursued consistent with the terms of the settlement, and the particular fail-safe mechanisms that are built into that settlement involving negotiations under article 29 and things of that kind. I am not going to spell out in any more detail&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Hill" NAMEID="BH4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator Hill</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You are speculating on the options.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have speculated on what the options might be and I have said that we may need to go down that particular track. If we do, it will be consistent with the settlement. If we do, it will still offer a chance, even if Senator Hill is not interested in that chance, of securing a lasting peace for the people of Cambodia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, there are elements of risk involved in this. Any continued presence of the United Nations in a situation where the Khmer Rouge is not cooperating creates the possibility of an outbreak of military conflict at any time. If that outbreak occurs in any systematic way there will be a fundamental problem so far as the retention of UN forces there is concerned, for reasons that have been spelt out on many previous occasions. But it is perfectly possible to believe that this settlement can be held together at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">May I say finally that the concept of quarantining the Khmer Rouge in the context that I have described is a very different concept from that of seeking to isolate the Khmer Rouge back in the period 18 months to two years ago, before we had a settlement, when the Khmer Rouge were still inextricably connected to China and were still with those sources of overt external support. If Senator Hill cannot understand the difference between an exercise in quarantining the Khmer Rouge now against all the background of a successful UN plan, which has detached the Khmer Rouge from the source of its external supply, and the kind of situation which existed previously, then Senator Hill is no longer simply guilty of malice, as I have always kindly assumed; he is guilty of overt and comprehensive stupidity as well.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GG4">Senator FOREMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce. Has the Minister seen reports that Mitsubishi Motors says it will abandon plans to invest $600m in Australia if this country were to adopt a zero tariff policy for the car industry? Has the Minister had examined claims that a policy of zero tariffs, combined with micro-economic reform, would increase employment in the industry by 5,000? Can the Minister comment on the outlook for the industry generally, and employment in particular, under the Government's policy?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Foreman asked me about the Mitsubishi statement reported in the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> today. I checked on that statement. Mitsubishi was approached by the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> to see what its views were about this issue. In response to that, Mitsubishi made the announcement which is reported in that paper today. That announcement means that the company would walk away from plans for a new $100m engine plant. It would abandon plans to make the next generation Magna in Australia. It would switch to imports and it would drastically cut its current work force of 4,200.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Chapman should go back to Adelaide and tell that to the electorate. If the honourable senator wants to identify himself in here, we will do it for him over there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This would be the first instalment in the price Australia would have to pay for the zero tariff policies of the Opposition. Of course, other investment decisions which have to be made in the next 12 to 18 months would be threatened by the Opposition's policies. The companies include Ford, General Motors and Toyota, which is unhappy with its significant investment in Altona.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this potential damage to Australian industry and Australian employment comes from the mindless ideological obsessions of the Leader of the Opposition and Mr McLachlan, the shadow Minister for Industry and Commerce. What we have seen is a victory for blind ideology over rationality. No amount of facts which conflict with that ideology will in any sense be persuasive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a long period of negotiations between the automotive companies and the Opposition in trying to resolve these issues. And still Mr McLachlan does not understand. He does not understand that this is a volume dependent industry and that volumes are crucial to the success of the industry in this country. He is not able to understand that fact.</PARA>

In the past two or three days, the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, has entered the lists, promising 5,000 new jobs in the automotive industry. He has promised us more jobs and cheaper cars. Mitsubishi exploded that sort of claim in its statement reported in the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> this morning.

We have been totally up-front with both the industry and the unions about employment. We have agreed that there will be reductions in employment over time, but not of the order which the Opposition policy proposes.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I know that all Australians will be sickened by the deliberate, calculated massacre of peaceful demonstrators which occurred at the hands of the Ciskei defence forces yesterday. Eye witness accounts, which have been confirmed by television footage, show that the Ciskei defence forces fired indiscriminately on peaceful demonstrators who were not in any way acting violently at the time or threatening violence. I say immediately that it is very difficult to accept the statement made by South African Ambassador Tothill this morning on ABC radio that the ANC should be regarded as sharing the responsibility for its provocation of the massacre. What the ANC was clearly doing was exercising its peaceful right to demonstrate in a democratic and peaceful manner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is about time the South African Government and its representatives showed some sensitive appreciation of what the democratic process is all about. The Ciskei massacre now has to be added to that long and ever growing litany of tragedies, including Sharpeville and Boipatong, which are the direct and inevitable by-product of the repressive apartheid system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said myself this morning, the tragedy shows how the apartheid system has corrupted and perverted so much of the institutional structure of South Africa and created the situation we are now seeing of the determination of those who have benefited from the system to cling on to their power and their privilege, undemocratically secured by them, at all costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been reports that the South African defence force units were in the area at the time of the massacre. We do not yet have any firm information about their role other than they do not appear to have been in any way participating directly in the shooting which occurred. It has to be said, however, that the massacre was committed by the Ciskei defence forces. The Ciskei Government is, of course, an entirely artificial product of the apartheid system, propped up by the South African Government, not recognised by any other government other than the South African Government, and which has an appalling record for abusing human rights. Certainly under international law the South African Government has to assume responsibility for the actions of the Ciskei authorities. We are of course looking to the South African Government to quickly take action to ensure that those responsible for the killings are brought to justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is too early to assess whether the presence of international observers could have averted this massacre. There were observers present from the national peace committees, but one lesson from it is the necessity to have an effective international presence in South Africa as soon as possible. We as an Australian government are firmly committed to assisting with the peace process in South Africa. I and the Prime Minister have made it clear that we are ready to participate in any international observer team under United Nations or Commonwealth auspices that may be sent to South Africa. Those United Nations observers are to take up their task this week and we are presently discussing with the Commonwealth what we might appropriately do by way of a supplementary exercise in that respect coordinated with it.</PARA>

One can only hope that this will be the shock that brings the parties back to the negotiating table and not the disaster that sends the whole system plunging once again into a downward spiral. It is a very unhappy situation. It is not one that could give anyone cause for any comfort. We can only hope and pray that some sanity will emerge out of this disaster.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Quite a bit. I saw Tim Fischer on television last night give a sterling performance, indicating that he would get some more efficiencies out of the waterfront. The news is that we have got the efficiencies out of the waterfront. The changes that I announced last week are a world model for obtaining real efficiency gains in an industry like the waterfront, without there being any massive disputation or disruption. These gains have produced startlingly higher productivity figures, quicker ship turnaround times and more efficient loading speeds with a reduced manning complement, without there being the disruption, confrontation and disputation that the Opposition's policies all promise to wreak on the Australian waterfront. It ought to be acknowledged that my ministerial colleague Senator Bob Collins had a large hand in achieving this, and credit should be paid where it is due.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week we concluded, through the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority and the stevedoring companies, talks which mean that 900 waterside workers will now leave the industry, accepting voluntary redundancy. This will exceed the levels we originally planned when we embarked on waterfront reform. It will mean that 5,000 will have left the industry since we commenced the reform process, a cut of some 56 per cent in the work force. A significant productivity boost has been set in train.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the recovery that we are now moving towards, we can expect that there will not be a need within the terms of the plan to increase the number of people employed on the waterfront because the efficiency gains will pick up the extra capacity demanded by the waterfront with the growth in Australian exports that will occur throughout the recovery period. Employee productivity on the Australian waterfront has doubled since we embarked on the waterfront reform program. There has been a 50 per cent increase in the average rate of the handling of containers on the waterfront. There has been a 40 per cent cut in the turnaround time on ships in port in Australia. There is a greater saving in dockside efficiency because of those gains.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will tell Senator Alston about Mr Dawkins in a minute if he would just be quiet. Dr Hewson says that the only reason Australia should join NAFTA&mdash;or the real reason&mdash;is to obtain compensatory concessions to offset the damage that has been done to our wheat growers through EEP. But there is simply no magic key for Australia in NAFTA that would generate those kinds of concessions. The only big returns that Australia could reasonably expect to get out of a free trade agreement with the United States or the NAFTA group of countries would be if we could get major concessions on major trade items such as sugar, beef and dairy products.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there is absolutely no reason to believe that United States special interest lobbies, which are so formidable in this area of managed trade, would yield in those areas. They would want to retain the very tight restrictions that presently exist in all those areas. The United States-Canada FTA and now the new NAFTA agreement itself do not restrain EEP or US export subsidies. Neither Mexico nor Canada got what they wanted from the agreement in those sensitive managed trade areas. Where they do appear to obtain concessions&mdash;and there are a few, obviously, in the agreement&mdash;these will equally take a very long time to impact.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that. Even in that respect, if it were the case that NAFTA were to deliver some benefits to us, we would have to make enormous policy concessions in return. Among the concessions we would have to anticipate would be the elimination of tariffs for NAFTA countries in our own sensitive industry sectors like textiles, clothing and footwear, and, of course, cars. It would involve clearly the removal of local content restrictions on television, broadcasting and advertising; it would involve changes in the foreign investment area; and it would involve dismantling of the Government's information industry policy. We know that because these are the sorts of things that the United States has already very squarely and explicitly put on the agenda.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know what the Opposition is going to do, if it gets the chance, to the Australian car industry.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a bigger question also about all this which goes to the larger issues of Australian trade policy. The stated intention of the Bush Administration so far as NAFTA is concerned is to build a free trade area in both the Americas&mdash;the whole of the North and South American continents. There is no suggestion that the United States has been thinking about extending NAFTA outside the Americas. All the indications are that it is a block building exercise looking south.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's prosperity depends upon our having liberal access into our own crucial Asian markets. Anyone who does not understand the balance of significance between the Asian markets and the American ones needs to think again because 60 per cent of our exports are now going into Asia and only 9.5 per cent to the United States. If we want to include all three NAFTA countries together, the grand total is 11.2 per cent. That is the kind of concept we are starting with at the moment&mdash;60 per cent of our exports going into south-east and north-east Asia; just over 11 per cent into the NAFTA area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, Australia's prosperity depends on keeping a free and open Asian trading area and Asia's prosperity, on which we depend, depends on keeping a free and open trading regime operating between it and the United States.

On 22 June the Prime Minister launched the national waste minimisation and recycling strategy which he claimed would halve the amount of waste going to land fill and increase the amount of recycling in Australia. The strategy included a review of the tax system and its impact on recycling. A whole three days later, the Government announced that, irrespective of the fact that it was having this review, it was going to impose a 20 per cent tax on toilet and tissue paper, paper bags and exercise books made from recycled paper. I ask the Minister: why is the Government announcing a policy to, on the one hand, halve the waste we generate over the next eight years and, on the other hand, destroy the market for recycled toilet and facial tissue as well as threaten the jobs of hundreds of Australians who work in the paper recycling industry?

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As announced by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and the Minister for Resources on 13 August 1992, the resources allocated to petroleum and minerals resource assessment within the former Bureau of Mineral Resources (now the Australian Geological Survey Organisation) will be merged with the Bureau of Rural Resources to form a new professionally independent Bureau within the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. Also included will be the National Resource Information Centre which was previously operated jointly by the Bureau of Rural Resources and the Bureau of Mineral Resources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new Bureau, in conjunction with the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, offers the prospect of much-improved support for the Government's decision making on resources matters through better integration of biological, geoscientific and economic resource information and analysis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Details of the transfer of the resource assessment functions have not yet been finalised. Preliminary indications, however, are that the transfer will involve less than 10 per cent of the former Bureau of Mineral Resources' resource base. The major direct expense will be the cost of the physical relocation of some 40 people, including fit-out of accommodation, which is likely to be in the order of $250 000. Other direct costs are expected to be minor as it is envisaged that computer databases and other data holdings will largely remain at their current location. Communication links are already in place which will meet the immediate operational needs of the transferred staff in connecting to and/or managing relevant computer databases. In addition there may be some indirect costs associated with accommodation rearrangements within the existing building and re-establishment of rented accommodation in order to take advantage of vacated space.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will also be some costs for stationery and signage changes resulting strictly from the change of name, rather than the transfer of functions. These costs are not expected to be major as every effort will be made to avoid unnecessary expenditure. The change of name marks the change in the organisation's role and more closely reflects international and State practice for such bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The transfer of staff will relieve to some extent the immediate accommodation difficulties being experienced by the Australian Geological Survey Organisation in its current building where the average floor-space per staff member is well below Australian Public Service guidelines. In their joint announcement, the Ministers stated that the Organisation will remain in its current accommodation until the review of administrative arrangements is completed and that in the interim, the Government will commit up to S5m to address accommodation issues, including immediate safety concerns in the current building.</PARA>

<PARA>I am pleased that the Government has taken up what I believe has been its responsibility all along, and that is to properly investigate what appear to have been failures on behalf of our law enforcement authorities in that these children were taken out of the protection of the Australian jurisdiction apparently so easily. So far, the Australian Government has not been prepared to tell the Australian people how that occurred and what the shortcomings were or put down any form of remedial plan so that such an unfortunate occurrence might not occur again.

The second shortcoming in the terms of reference is that there is no instruction to investigate and advise what resources the Australian Federal Police or the Australian Customs Service in fact applied to this search for the Gillespie children. It has been alleged, of course, that the resources that were applied were insufficient. There has been some public debate about that but, I might say, on a shortage of facts.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a staunch member of the Country Party, later the National Country Party, his prominence in rural affairs made him a natural choice when a Senate vacancy arose in 1958 on the death of Senator Seward. He went on to represent the people of Western Australia as a senator for 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His achievements as a parliamentarian also mark him as one of the most distinguished Australians of his time.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to his most significant achievement in the offices he held was his contribution to the coalition. I am reliably informed that he was a powerful force for unity at difficult times in the early 1970s.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir Thomas led a life of great distinction. He was a man of great courage.

He was leader of the National Party in the Senate for seven years from 1969 to 1975. After retirement from the Senate he was Federal President of the Party from 1978 to 1981.

It is an area in the near wheat belt of Western Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been mentioned, Sir Thomas was educated at Guildford Grammar School and joined the RAAF during World War II. As Senator Boswell has just pointed out and as shown in a little piece from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>, he had a very distinguished career in the RAAF. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> points out that he served with distinction as a pilot, joining the RAAF in 1941. He went on to take part in 63 bombing raids throughout Europe and the Middle East, including missions over Tobruk and during the battle of El Alamein. He rose to the  rank of flight lieutenant and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross before being discharged from the RAAF in December 1945. He was clearly a man of great courage who was prepared to put his life on the line for his country. I was also interested to read that he later served as Minister for Air from 1969 to 1972. I reflect on how many Ministers today have actually had practical experience in the areas in which they later serve as Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Boswell has said, Sir Thomas also took a great interest in farming matters at the political level. He was President of the Wool Section and also the Vice President of the Australian Wool and Meat Producers' Federation immediately before he was elected into the Senate where he filled a casual vacancy in 1958. As others have pointed out, he went on to serve in the Senate for 20 years. At that time he was the longest serving senator. He represented the Country National Party, as it was in those days. In that capacity he also rose to the rank of Deputy President of this chamber between 1976 and 1978. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was also interested to read that Sir Thomas was a great conciliator, particularly in the early 1970s.

Clearly, he was, as others have said, a man very able to bring people together and get them to work together. Immediately after he left the Senate he was knighted. Clearly, he went on to take a great interest in politics and continued to serve the country very well until his death.

I met Tom Drake-Brockman, although very briefly, in the 1970 Senate election campaign when we were political rivals in Western Australia. As is well-known, for 30 years or more the Liberal Party and the then National Country Party, now the National Party, had separate Senate tickets. The 1970 Senate election was no exception. At that election Tom Drake-Brockman was a Minister as well as a well-known senator. Our paths crossed very briefly during that election. As one is want to do in election campaigns, we had little personal contact as political rivals. However, shortly after that when I came into the Senate, Tom Drake-Brockman was the leader of the National Country Party in this chamber. Virtually, in effect, he was Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate. It was from that time forward that I really got to know him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to speak briefly of the eighteen months that I observed Sir Thomas as a Minister, which was from about 1971 to 1972, the second half of his period as a Minister in the chamber. He was a most effective Minister. I speak mostly of his performance in this chamber where, as Minister, he represented a number of portfolios other than his own, all of which he handled with great aplomb and political finesse. For several months he was the Acting Leader of the Government in the Senate. He performed that role&mdash;although it was thrust upon him somewhat unexpectedly, for that period of time at least&mdash;most effectively and I was most impressed by him. As the years passed to 1978 we became very much better known to each other and we became very close political friends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir Thomas was a most solid performer in this chamber, not only in his role as a Minister but also, as I have mentioned, as a very effective Chairman of Committees. He was a great colleague. It was a great shame that his career as a Minister was not resumed after the 1975 election. Because of the exigencies of the political fortunes of his party, at that election he was elected only tenth&mdash;at that time each State had 10 senators. His election as a senator was not certain for some weeks and by that time the Fraser Government had been formed. Unfortunately, he was not able to be included in it. I always thought this was a shame because he certainly deserved to become a Minister again in 1975, even though he would have held that position only until his retirement in 1978. Nevertheless, Tom Drake-Brockman resumed his position as Chairman of Committees for the remainder of his term in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I particularly remember him in terms of the heady political days of 1974 and 1975. We were colleagues in the shadow ministry. He was then Leader of the National Country Party and a shadow Minister. I can remember very well the events of 11 November 1975. Funnily enough, he always comes to my mind when I recall this event because he was the first person who told me of the dismissal. I came into the chamber just before 2 p.m. The bells were ringing prior to the Senate resuming for the afternoon. I do not think we had Question Time on that day or at that time. Tom Drake-Brockman and I sat next to each other. As soon as I sat down he said, `Do you know that Gough has been dismissed?', or words to that effect. It was just as well that I had sat down&mdash;it was such a surprise that I would have needed to. Indeed, he failed to convince me that what he said had happened was in fact true. Only a few minutes later the Appropriation Bills were called on. Reg Withers got up and said that the Opposition would agree that the Bills we had been fighting bitterly over for some weeks be passed. That is my most vivid memory of my association with Tom Drake-Brockman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Hill has already said, a very strong partnership was formed between Tom Drake-Brockman, his colleagues and ourselves, even though there was not a formal coalition in the Senate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make a few brief observations about what I remember of that time. It has already been noted that Sir Thomas Drake-Brockman was an old Guildfordian. His son and I also attended Guildford Grammar School. Of course, I got to know Sir Thomas through my association with Guildford Grammar School.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My first memory of Sir Thomas Drake-Brockman was the involvement that he had with my father in the wool industry in Western Australia. Although I was not very old at that time&mdash;I was probably 14 or 15&mdash;I used to attend industry meetings with my father. Names that come to mind are Bill Ball from Katanning and Eric Hitchin from, I believe, Tambellup. They played an enormous role at that time in changes that were made to the Australian Wool Board. I can remember attending a meeting at Miling about 1957, the year after I left school. At that meeting Sir Thomas Drake-Brockman outlined suggested changes to the wool industry. This was before the Australian Wool Commission was established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is rather tragic that the principles that were outlined at that time by Sir Thomas Drake-Brockman and others were forgotten some time down the track. The role of the Wool Commission, which became the Wool Corporation, changed. The Commission operated very well for a number of years. It then became the Wool Corporation. A number of things happened. As a result, the Corporation changed its role and tried to become a price setting authority. I remember those events well. Certainly, the Western Australian wool producers owe a great debt of gratitude to Tom Drake-Brockman for the role that he then played. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must also comment on the role that Sir Thomas Drake-Brockman played in respect of the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation. When I first became a member of the executive of what was known as the Farmers Union, which later became the Farmers Federation, I can remember sitting down with Sir Don Eckersley and talking with Tom Drake-Brockman, who was Vice President of the AWMPF. The AWMPF was a forerunner of the National Farmers Federation&mdash;it was an organisation that amalgamated with the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council. Sir Thomas was involved at that time&mdash;this was carried on later by Sir Don Eckersley and others&mdash;in steering the industry towards what is now known as the National Farmers Federation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I particularly wanted to make those points in this debate because not only did Sir Thomas Drake-Brockman have a distinguished career in politics but also he had a very distinguished career in the formulation of agricultural politics in Western Australia. Certainly, the farmers of Western Australia owe him a debt of gratitude for the contribution he made at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also remember Sir Thomas Drake-Brockman well for another reason. One of his virtues was that he was a great communicator. When he went into politics he made it his business to inform as often as possible members of the Farmers Union what was going on. He was also a great listener. I certainly learnt a lot from him. I learnt that while we have a role in life to communicate things, we also have a role to listen to what people have to say, to absorb that message and to pass it on in appropriate forums. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those are the things that I remember very succinctly about Sir Thomas Drake-Brockman. I am sure that if my father were still with us he would certainly endorse the comments that I have made about his friend Sir Thomas Drake-Brockman&mdash;or Tom as he knew him. At that time my father was very heavily involved in local government. My uncle, Bert Crane, who served in the Western Australian Parliament for a long period, spent time with Tom Drake-Brockman and others discussing the general development of the Moora-Wongan Hills-New Norcia area. These are points that I remember well&mdash;I think they are worth putting on the record. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Kernot,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of submissions have been made to the Senate Select Committee for Sales Tax Legislation expressing the concerns of the farm machinery industry and in particular those of we, the dealers, who will be expected to bear the cost of the proposed changes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our major concern is that goods purchased by dealers for subsequent retail sale for use in agriculture (a sales tax exempt industry) will attract 20% sales tax until refunded by the Tax Office following the retail sale which may occur months later.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although we are advised that Section 84 of the proposed new legislation allowed the Tax Commissioner discretionary power to treat stock purchases as tax exempt in a similar manner as applies today, we are opposed to reliance upon this discretion as it is dependant upon the view of an individual rather than a defined set of guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We therefore strongly request that the legislation is amended to ensure that conditions pertaining to sales tax in an exempt industry remain as they are today where there is no unnecessary financial burden on the middleman, in this case the dealer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly if this legislation goes through unamended there is a distinct possibility that some dealers will be unable to comply with the financial impost and will decide to cease operations.</PARA>

That is, $150,000 will have to be borrowed for every $1m of stock. The dealers will have to pay interest. This is the point of misrepresentation.

That is true, but the point is that they are not being rebated immediately and that is the dealers' problem. For many businesses the GST period will be six months, although it may be as little as one month for large firms. The Opposition has not listened to the real substance of the complaint, which is not a matter of whether it is rebatable but of the financial imposition of the interim period when the dealers have to carry this stock. That is the nature of the complaint, not what Opposition senators claim was my representation of it. Whether they can reclaim the ground is up to them, but I think their attack was cowardly and offensive. </PARA>

<PARA>I raised this matter, to which Senator Kernot has now responded by way of personal explanation, during the adjournment debate on Thursday, 20 August 1992. It came up as a result of a letter which Senator Kernot had sent, as I understand it, to most farm machinery dealers, certainly over a very wide area if not the whole of Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second, and much more important, issue that I raised&mdash;as I said, the second part of Senator Kernot's letter concerns me a great deal more&mdash;is that part of the letter which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think you should be aware that the GST will impose an automatic tax penalty on farm machinery dealers. That is, your business will be detrimentally affected by the GST in exactly the manner that you feared would happen under the new wholesale sales tax regime.</PARA>

<PARA>With great respect to Senator Kernot's so-called understanding of tax matters, what she says in that letter reveals that she does not have a clue about how the GST works. That is appalling for the key spokesperson of a party which says with great arrogance that, on a coalition government coming to office, it will block the proposals to introduce the GST. The arrogance of that to the Australian community is absolutely mind-blowing. That arrogance, based on a complete misunderstanding and ignorance of how the GST works, compounds the problem in an almost unbelievable way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two reasons why that statement is fundamentally wrong. Firstly, there is an implication in the statement that GST would be paid on that machinery. That is not so. Farm machinery is a business input and, therefore, is fully tax rebatable. The clear implication in the first of those two paragraphs that I quoted is that GST will be paid on that machinery. Senator Kernot must surely know that that is not true. If she does not know it, her level of ignorance is appalling. If she does know it, she wilfully set out to mislead the farm machinery dealers and farmers of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kernot should listen because she is talking at the moment to someone who knows even less about the GST than she does. I suggest that she concentrate on this. She has misled the Parliament and the farm machinery dealers and farmers of Australia. This is something that she ought to listen to. The second paragraph, to which I take great exception because it is wrong, says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the Fightback! documents, GST will be payable on all your stock purchases, including all transitional stocks held at the time of the introduction of the GST.</PARA>
<PARA>Where that is wrong is that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> specifically says that sales tax that has been paid on stock will be repaid; therefore, at the time of the introduction of the GST. Far from it being the problem that Senator Kernot talks about, the GST will provide a very significant cash flow bonus to dealers. They will get back the money that they have paid on the wholesale sales tax regardless of whether or not that machinery gets sold within a reporting period. In other words, those for whom the machinery sits as stock for a lengthy period will be massively better off for cash flow than they are now. So Senator Kernot is absolutely wrong in what she says as far as the implications of the GST are concerned. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, what had happened was that a number of machinery dealers had written to Senator Kernot. I received a number of letters myself. The prime concern of these machinery dealers was that the Government's proposed changes to the sales tax legislation would disadvantage them. In fact, those machinery dealers had not been led to believe that that would occur. They had not been led to believe that by the Government and they certainly had not been led to believe that by the Democrats. They were led to believe that there was a problem with the legislation by somebody else. I will not presume to guess who that somebody else might have been. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that they got it wrong, because the questions which were addressed to the personnel from the Australian Taxation Office during the Senate inquiry into the matter showed that there was a misunderstanding as to the effect of this particular legislation. It was feared that machinery agents would have to find an extra 20 per cent on top of their purchase price from their wholesalers and carry that on the floor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, their fears were unfounded and Senator Kernot merely wrote to these people to explain to them that these fears had been removed by the answers given to the Senate inquiry.

We have had explained to us that the tax is paid, an application is made and then it has to be refunded. Senator Kernot's letter did not say anything other than that the tax would have to be paid and there would be a period of transition. There was no mention of how long that had to be, whether it had to be a bureaucratic form filling exercise or whatever. However, those very same fears which had applied to the potential of the Government's proposed legislation still apply in full force to what is proposed under the precious GST garbage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not what the dealers are saying because they are quite clear. It is what Senator Kernot is confusing them with. It is a very simple explanation. Let me just put it to the Senate as someone who sold to farm machinery dealers for 18 years before I got into this place. If a farm machinery dealer buys $1m worth of parts or tractors in 30 days, he pays $1m and $150,000 as GST. At the end of 15 days, he gets that $150,000 back because that will be enshrined in legislation. He has to get that back because that is what the legislation says.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me just look at some of the up sides for this particular machinery dealer. In the past, he has not paid sales tax on farmers' parts, but that same dealer may have tools, he may have letterboxes, he may have paint in his store, and all of this attracts a sales tax. It is not complex. He may have a stock of $300,000. In a hardware store, that stock turns over about four times a year. So when he pays tax on an item, say, a tool box for $10, he is paying $1.50. Before the GST, he may have had to sit on that item for 12 months before he got his sales tax rebated. Now, he gets his sales tax rebated in 15 days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will be a boon for the retail industry. Average hardware stores probably have half a million dollars worth of merchandise, all of it attracting sales tax of about $75,000. They may have to hold much of that sales tax for nine or 12 months before they sell the particular items that attract the sales tax. Under the GST, they get that back within 15 days. If people cannot understand that proposition, they should not be in this place. I rest my case. </PARA>

That is the great tragedy. What I was saying with relevance to that is that not only does Senator Kernot misrepresent it but so does Mr Dawkins. He keeps on doing exactly what Senator Kernot has done. A fortnight ago he said that Treasury had found a $4 billion hole in Fightback. Wrong. Simply not true. Nonetheless he said it. Two days later, the Government upped the ante by $2 billion. On <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> he said that a $6 billion hole had been found. Wrong. Simply not true.

If one were to be generous, one could suggest that it is a shame that Senator Kernot does not understand; it is such a pity that she does not understand. But she does understand. She is intentionally misrepresenting the policy because she is trying desperately to give the Democrats some credentials as to why they are not going to do what their founder said they would do to a government&mdash;and that is to keep the bastards honest. They know that when we are elected they are going to have to find some way out of trying to stop us being faithful to our promise. This is all paving the way for it&mdash;for Senator Kernot to prove that she is not going to go ahead and allow a government to run on the promises that it has given.

The Australian Democrats do not understand&mdash;and I am certain members of the Government do not understand&mdash;how machinery dealers and their businesses operate. They do not understand how they bulk buy. They do not understand the imposition of wholesale sales tax when they have to carry parts for up to 12 months. The only way machinery dealers in isolated areas can buy at a reasonable price to supply the people in those areas is to buy in bulk. With the wholesale sales tax regime, they carry the price of that right through until the day they sell. Under the GST proposal, as has already being explained&mdash;and I will not go over that&mdash;they will be rebated on the prescribed day and they will not carry the cost.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not have to rely on our figures; I can go straight to the figures of the Treasury, which identified that there would be a $1 billion saving to agriculture under the Fightback package.

They will have money in their pockets'. At the same time, they recognised that under Fightback and the GST proposal their operating costs will in fact be lower. People will be better off on two counts: first, the cost structure of the machinery dealers will be lower and, secondly, the people they deal with and who provide their very existence, the farmers themselves, will be better off because they will have more money in their pockets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is hypocritical of the Democrats in this case to adopt the same sorts of policies that we have heard so consistently from the Australian Labor Party about the impact of Fightback on businesses. Fightback will significantly lower the cost of business in this country, particularly to machinery dealers, in a number of areas. I will not canvass all of those areas at this point in time, but it is worth noting that the removal of payroll tax, the removal of fuel excise and the removal of wholesales sales tax will allow them once again to become competitive. </PARA>

It is a very important matter and a number of witnesses have put in a very great deal of time and effort to prepare submissions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important that the Government has the benefit of that report before it proceeds any further with the National Road Transport Commission and the national road transport charges. It is very important that the people of Australia understand just what the Labor Party and the Government propose for road user charges before the Federal election comes around. There was some hesitation on our side that there was an attempt to push this aside, although I certainly do not accuse Senator Foreman of being a party to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NRTC has recommended a set amount of charges and has also indicated that the Government should set aside 18c per litre from the fuel tax to go to road charges. It is most important that the people of Australia understand just what the Government is going to do about that before the election&mdash;whether that recommendation of an 18c component of the current fuel tax will be a road user charge or whether the fuel tax will be increased by yet another 18c per litre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those reasons, we certainly hope that this report is tabled and that the Government responds to it well before it seeks to take any further action with legislation on the National Road Transport Commission. I might say that, on our side of the Committee&mdash;and I think the Democrats, although they can speak for themselves&mdash;we will certainly oppose any legislation dealing with the National Road Transport Commission if it is introduced before this Committee report is tabled and responded to by the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly to the motion to extend the deadline for the report by the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. The legislation that established the National Road Transport Commission was passed in the Senate last June. The coalition sought to have that legislation referred to a committee before the Commission was set up. However, the Democrats made an arrangement with the Government and supported the legislation, and an inquiry was set up into the effects of those proposed charges.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I always believed that we would have the report of that inquiry before any charging legislation was passed through the Senate, because it should be remembered that in the beginning the legislation only set up the Commission. It seemed to me that the Government did not wish the Committee to report until 31 March. At a Committee meeting the coalition was steamrolled out of that idea. I believed then, as I do now, that if we are to have an inquiry, let us have the inquiry, let us have the report and let us have the Government response before we bring in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this stage, I commend Senator Vicki Bourne, who saw my side of things&mdash;not as to whether we agree on the charges but that if we are to have an inquiry, let us see what it says before the charges are applied. At this stage I am happy that the Government has now decided to report by 14 December, but I still express concern that we may have the legislation before 14 December. I look to the Government not to bring in legislation setting up those far reaching charges&mdash;and they are far reaching, as we have found in hearings around Australia&mdash;before we have the report. I will leave it to the good sense of the Government not to bring in the legislation until we have seen all of that. I welcome the better cooperation we have had from Senator Foreman since we had the original debate at that Committee meeting. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 18 August 1992, I made a statement about an incident at Parliament House on 12 August, involving a vehicle which was driven through the main entrance to the building. In that statement I referred to a report on the incident by Price Waterhouse Urwick and advised that copies of that report had been made available to the Party leaders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I also announced that the Speaker and I would commission a wider review of the protective security of Parliament House. That review has now commenced. Mr David Bell, the Director of Protective Security and Policy Training of the Federal Office of Justice and Superintendent Curtis, the Parliament House Security Controller on secondment from the Australian Federal Police, are conducting a comprehensive assessment of the security risks and threats to, and vulnerabilities of, Parliament House. The report on that assessment, to be completed by 2 October, is the first stage of the wider review. The next stage is to consider changes to current security arrangements to contain the identified risks and threats, and to reduce the vulnerabilities of the building and its occupants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Later today I will table a report of the Auditor-General which comments on Parliament House security. The review which I have just announced will address the concerns of the Auditor-General.

First, there is the right of people in a parliamentary democracy to observe their parliament at work and to have access to their representatives. Second, senators and members must be permitted to perform their duties in safety and without interference. I assure honourable senators that the Speaker and I will give careful consideration to any proposed changes to security arrangements, having regard to the maintenance of a proper balance between those two important principles.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>I speak very briefly to the Auditor-General's Report No. 1 on Ministerial portfolios. First, I commend the Auditor-General for bringing this report out just ahead of the Senate Estimates committee hearings as it will be of great assistance to honourable senators in those committees. This report includes details of audits carried out in the six-month period to 30 June 1992 which to date have not been reported to the Parliament, but it also contains summary information on some audits previously reported under separate cover during the 1991-92 financial year. Of course, I should remind the Senate that some of those were quite significant, as the Audit Office notes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key impacts from audits reported during that year included the Audit Office estimate that $12m in avoidable additional costs were incurred in the Sydney central building construction project because certain risks to the Commonwealth were not properly managed; scope for the rationalisation of potential disposal of high value, low utilised or unused Army training areas with an estimated value of $15m; and an estimated $29m to $46m in annual energy costs which could be saved through better energy management in Commonwealth buildings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since then there have been some quite significant findings and impacts. The report, for example, states that the Australian Sports Drug Agency:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . needed to strengthen its documentation procedures in relation to testing, needed to implement an effective management information system and consider protective security matters to ensure the reliability, confidentiality and safety of information and assets.</PARA>
<PARA>On the National Library, the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review of the National Library's collection security and preservation found that there was no consolidated comprehensive protective security policy and that the assignment of security responsibilities detracted from the efficient and effective control over security. The audit also identified concerns in respect of the security procedures over national security classified material.</PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General's inquiry into the Attorney-General's portfolio in the bankruptcy administration noted something I suppose we are all aware of, and that is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of procedural breakdowns are attributable to the sharp increases in the number of bankruptcies dealt with during the year.</PARA>
<PARA>Obviously this is a direct consequence of the recession Mr Keating says we had to have. In the Department of Defence, there was a most extraordinary audit finding, which says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The audits carried out within the Department of Defence have, in the main, a common finding, i.e. the lack of relevant, appropriate and useful information to facilitate efficient and effective management of the areas under review.</PARA>
<PARA>No doubt the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray), who is in the chamber at the moment, will have the opportunity of dealing with that matter at the Senate Estimates Committee hearing which will take place shortly. In the Employment, Education and Training portfolio, audits undertaken by the Department:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . continued to disclose deficiencies in basic control procedures and accounting routines&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and so on. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there is an urgent need for further training in basic Commonwealth accounting practices at the operational levels. . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Audits `disclosed a lack of understanding and application of prescribed accountancy routines'. The Auditor-General notes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is particularly important given the heavily devolved nature of Departmental operations.</PARA>
<PARA>In the Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs portfolio, the Auditor-General found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that there was scope for improvement in the Department's administration of grants, particularly in ensuring the Department's grant requirements and conditions were met.</PARA>
<PARA>With the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, the report states that the Australian Customs Service:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . should improve the level of documentation of searches undertaken. . . Customs had not taken appropriate steps to prevent or detect the illegal copying of computer software and its personal computer environment was at some risk of virus infection.</PARA>
<PARA>I remind the Senate that there was much concern about the risk of virus infection not too long ago. With the Department of Social Security, the Auditor-General found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The issue of greatest concern was the Department's fixed asset registers, which could not be relied upon to provide materially correct figures.</PARA>
<PARA>That seems a fairly damning sort of comment. In Transport and Communications, the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the performance of the internal audit section was affected adversely by staff changes and its involvement in ad hoc management initiated activities.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this Bill:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">terminates the Australian Honey Board from 1 January 1993 through the repeal of the Honey Marketing Act 1988;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">makes provision for certain functions of the Australian Honey Board to be carried out on behalf of the Australian honey industry by the Australian Horticultural Corporation;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">makes the necessary consequential amendments to Honey Levy Acts (Nos 1 &amp; 2) 1962, Honey Export Charge Act 1973, the Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1987; and the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">repeals the marketing component of the Honey Export Charge Act 1973 from 1 January 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The major purpose of this Bill is to end a traditional statutory marketing arrangement, which has operated for some 30 years; and to bring Government involvement in honey industry marketing under new arrangements which are more cost effective and appropriate to the marketing environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The termination of the Australian Honey Board, the transfer of functions to the Australian Horticultural Corporation and the repeal of the marketing component of the export charge all have the support of the two representative industry organisations, the Federal Council of Australian Apiarists' Association and the Honey Packers and Marketers Association of Australia. The Australian Honey Board itself endorses the proposed changes and the Australian Horticultural Corporation welcomes the honey industry to its growing list of participating industries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill represents the culmination of some 14 months of negotiation and discussion among industry, the Australian Honey Board, the Australian Horticultural Corporation and the Department of Primary Industries and Energy since the then Minister Kerin, announced that the Government would not be extending the Australian Honey Board beyond its legislated sunset of 11 May 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I congratulate the honey industry for the cooperative and constructive manner in which it has worked, and continues to work, with the Government to implement the new marketing arrangements embodied in this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decision followed the Government's review of the recommendations of the Davis Review Committee on Commonwealth Primary Industry Statutory Marketing Authorities in 1990. The Davis Committee reported that the smaller marketing authorities, including the Australian Honey Board, faced the problem of high operating costs relative to levy income and services provided. It recommended that consideration be given to merging the smaller marketing authorities into larger umbrella organisations, which would be able to provide a more efficient and cost effective legislative and administrative infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian honey industry is a small but very important industry with a gross value of production of about $40 million, although its impact on agriculture is far greater through pollination. It exports about 40% of its production. The Australian Honey Board operates on a budget of about $500,000 of which about half is absorbed in administration costs, and the Davis Committee recommendations would have added to these costs. Moreover, since the board was reconstituted under the 1988 Act, its functions had effectively reduced to generic promotion based on a limited budget and provision of information services to the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The function of setting minimum export prices for bulk honey was ineffectual, with Australia's share of the world trade only about one per cent and hence a price taker. Export licensing had become virtually automatic as long as the applicant had a sound business, honey available and export experience. The board had also terminated the outdated practice of appointing overseas selling agents. The industry subsequently requested that termination of the board be brought forward to 31 December 1992 on the basis that there was little reason to extend the board's life beyond the time necessary for industry to consider its future marketing options. The board itself agreed with this course of action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Industry established an Australian Honey Board Review Committee to consider its options, which were to continue statutory cover under the Australian Horticultural Corporation or to go it alone backed by a voluntary levy. The review committee duly recommended the continuation of statutory marketing arrangements under the Australian Horticultural Corporation, supported by statutory levies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Moving the honey industry's marketing arrangements under the umbrella of the Australian Horticultural Corporation is expected to result in administrative savings to the industry of up to $100,000 per annum. Moreover, the  apiary industry is becoming more involved in commercial pollination and the development of linkages with horticulture could facilitate this progress.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The review committee also recommended that the marketing component of the honey export charge be repealed which would result in a reduction of receipts of about $70,000 per annum. The rationale for the abolition of this charge is that the export promotion funded by it is largely ineffectual, as this amount is too small for generic export promotion and the largest proportion of Australian honey exports is in bulk form for blending in the country of destination. Abolition of this levy will provide honey exporters, who pay the charge, with additional funds which could be more effectively used in the promotion of pre-packaged brand name exports in higher return niche markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The review committee's recommendations were unanimously supported by a special general meeting of the Federal Council of Australian Apiarists' Association on 28 October 1991 and subsequently endorsed by the Honey Packers and Marketers Association of Australia. As part of the process of moving the honey industry to the new marketing arrangements, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed on 27 February 1992 by the Federal Council of Australian Apiarists' Association, as the organisation representing levy payers, and the Australian Horticultural Corporation. The Memorandum of Understanding sets out terms and conditions by which the honey industry agreed to move under the statutory cover of the Horticultural Corporation for an initial period to 30 June 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would now like to refer briefly to the essential features of the Bill. Part 2 of the Bill deals with the repeal of the Honey Marketing Act and provisions for the board's assets, liabilities and obligations to be transferred to the Australian Horticultural Corporation. All assets will be separately identified and used to the benefit of the honey industry. Any transferred liabilities will be met by the Corporation solely from transferred liquid assets or from future levies and charges raised from the honey industry. In this context I would note that if for any reason the honey industry decides to leave the umbrella of the Australian Horticultural Corporation after 30 June 1995, the disposal of any net assets will be determined in a manner which benefits the honey industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is also provision for the board to continue after 31 December 1992 solely for the purpose of finalising and submitting the final Annual Report of the board. Part 3 of the Bill makes definitional amendments to the Australian Horticultural Act to allow the honey industry to come under that Act. Transitional provisions allow honey levies and charges to be paid to the Australian Horticultural Corporation, including outstanding levies and charges. Part 4 of the Bill deals with the repeal of  the marketing component of the Export charge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further detailed explanation is contained in the Explanatory Memorandum. Following passage of this Bill, Regulations will be made to specify the particular functions that the Corporation will perform on behalf of the honey industry. These functions will include promotion, public relations activities, consumer education, quality assurance and information dissemination.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the board members for their service to the honey industry. The board, led by the Chairman, Mr Philip Chandler, has been very effective and innovative since its appointment in 1989. It has developed and implemented a promotion strategy based on sound market research, facilitated a new era of cooperation between producers and packers, encouraged new directions in marketing, eliminated the outdated practice of appointing overseas selling agents and moved from setting minimum export prices to a system of guideline export prices. Indeed it could be said that its efforts have contributed to the level of industry maturity, which has allowed its reduced functions to be transferred to the Australian Horticultural Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The board has prudently managed its finances to provide for its termination and transfer of its functions. I am assured that there will be adequate funds to meet all its financial liabilities. These liabilities are principally to the staff of the board who become redundant with the termination of the board. I would also like to extend my tribute to the loyalty of the staff of four, who have served the board well for a long period. The board is exercising all care and consideration for the staff, following the guidelines established under the Australian Government Statutory Authorities Redeployment and Retirement (Redundancy) Award 1988.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are no financial implications to the Commonwealth arising from this Bill and research and development arrangements for the honey industry remain unchanged. I commend the Bill to Honourable Senators and present the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION BILL 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am pleased to be able to move the introduction of a major piece of legislation on a matter which so deeply affects the lives and opportunities of people with disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Disability Discrimination Bill will make discrimination on the basis of disability unlawful in Australia. The Bill will assist all people with disabilities to exercise their rights as Australian citizens and represents a landmark in achieving human rights for all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People with disabilities are entitled to the same rights and the same opportunities as all other Australian citizens. However, our society currently falls well short of realising this ideal. People are still subjected to discrimination purely on the basis of disability&mdash;discrimination which, I am sure all honourable Senators would agree, is socially damaging, morally unacceptable and a cost to the whole community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Research has shown that people with disabilities still face a number of barriers to the equal enjoyment of human rights in many areas of life. These include employer and co-worker attitudes, access to premises and transport and the types of jobs available. During an extensive series of consultations about ways to address these barriers, people with disabilities, their families and advocates and service providers called upon the Government to introduce comprehensive disability discrimination legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Government has a long term commitment to achieving a better deal for people with disabilities. The Government began the process of expanding opportunities for people with disabilities in 1983 with the comprehensive review of programs and services for people with disabilities&mdash;the Handicapped Programs Review. The outcomes of this review culminated in the implementation of the Disability Services Act in 1987. The Act requires that services for people with disabilities be provided in a manner consistent with their rights as Australian citizens and as human beings. These include the right to dignity, privacy, choice and the fulfilment of their capacities to contribute fully in community life.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Disability Services Act is regarded internationally as a significant step forward in legislative support for services assisting people with disabilities. It was welcomed by people with disabilities, their families and representatives. The Principles and Objectives of the Act provided Australia with a set of ideals to strive for, and today, the Act has won widespread community understanding and support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now, at the end of the United Nations Decade of Disabled Persons, I think it timely to be able to introduce legislation which will extend these principles to all walks of life. The principles need to be taken up within society as a whole so that they reach all Australians with disabilities, regardless of whether they are receiving support services under the Disability Services Act. The Disability Discrimination Bill will be instrumental in continuing social change and will have far reaching and long-awaited effects for people with disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not believe there is any better example of social justice than this legislation&mdash;legislation which provides the framework to eliminate the discrimination which prevents fair access for people with disabilities to jobs, education, sport and entertainment and which provides an effective means of overcoming perhaps the most significant barrier that people with disabilities face in this country&mdash;the attitudinal barrier.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill recognises that discrimination against people with disabilities is a matter of international concern. It is another significant step in fulfilling Australia's international obligations under a number of United Nations instruments. These include the International Labour Organisation convention concerning discrimination in respect of employment and occupation; the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; and a number of related declarations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, none of this would have been possible without the commitment and courage of people who believed in the legislation. While I do not like to single out any particular individuals in the process, Mr Graeme Innes, Chairperson of the Disability Advisory Council of Australia, Ms Chris Ronalds and the representatives of the Disability Anti-Discrimination Legislation Committee bear special mention. Today, not twelve months after the establishment of this Committee, we are in the fortunate position of bringing this significant indicator of the Government's continuing commitment to social justice before the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The overall response from industry groups and State governments has also been very positive. The Government has received extensive comment from interested parties in relation to the proposal to introduce legislation. The Bill was left to lie in the House over the winter recess so that interested parties could make any further comments. This timing builds on the widespread discussions already undertaken on the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Legislative reform is vital if the very real, but unfair, barriers that prevent people with disabilities from playing effective and valued roles are to be broken down. The legislation would constitute the legal basis for the protection and promotion of the rights of people with disabilities and would subsequently help to overcome social and economic disadvantage, by assisting people with disabilities to participate as equals in Australian society.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I turn now to a more detailed description of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation would be grievance based and fundamentally similar to the Commonwealth's existing anti-discrimination legislation; the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (RDA) and the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (SDA). The legislation would promote gradual structural reforms<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"> </EMPHASIS>and attitudinal change&mdash;changes which would enhance the opportunities available to people with disabilities throughout community life.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The objects of the Bill are to eliminate, as far as possible, discrimination against persons on the ground of disability in the areas of work, accommodation, education, clubs, sport, the provision of goods, facilities, services and land, existing laws and the administration of Commonwealth laws and programs; to ensure, as far as practicable, that people with disabilities have the same rights to equality before the law as their fellow citizens; and to promote recognition and acceptance within the community of the principle that people with disabilities have the same fundamental rights as their fellow citizens. The legislation would therefore perform an important educative role and would further social awareness and change.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation would cover both direct and indirect discrimination on the ground of disability, and would also cover discrimination on the basis of association with people with disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation would apply throughout Australia and in this regard relies on all available and appropriate heads of Commonwealth constitutional power.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the preparation of this Bill, the Government has paid attention to existing State disability discrimination legislation and the role played by State disability discrimination machinery in eliminating discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Disability anti-discrimination legislation currently exists in differing forms in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory. Such legislation is proposed for Tasmania and the Northern Territory. However, there are considerable variations in the scope and coverage of the various Acts. National, comprehensive legislation is required in order to ensure that people with disabilities are not disadvantaged by their place of residence. Moreover, State legislation alone does not provide comprehensive coverage for people with disabilities, due to the limited ability of the States to regulate discriminatory practices against Commonwealth authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill includes a definition of disability that draws upon existing definitions in both Commonwealth and State legislation and includes the concepts of physical, sensory, intellectual and psychiatric impairment. The definition of disability includes the total or partial loss of a bodily function; the presence in the body of organisms causing, or capable of causing, disease, including HIV AIDS; total or partial loss of a part of the body; and malfunction or disfigurement of part of a person's body. It includes a disability which presently exists, existed in the past but has now ceased to exist, or may exist in the future, and a disability which is imputed or presumed to a person. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will now describe the areas in which the Bill proscribes discrimination on the ground of disability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation would make unlawful discrimination against applicants for jobs and employees generally and would include access to employment; the practices of employment agencies; the use of discriminatory questions in employment application forms; access to opportunities for promotion, transfer or training, or to any other benefits connected with employment; and dismissal of an employee or subjecting an employee to any detriment. The legislation would also cover the employment of agents and contract workers; membership as a partner in a firm; membership of a trade union; and any action of a licensing or a qualifying body with respect to the conferring, renewal or extension of any licence or qualification.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With regard to education, it would be unlawful for an educational authority to discriminate in the admission and treatment of students and in the provision of all levels of education, training and vocational or educational assistance, including financial assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would be unlawful to discriminate against people with a disability in relation to the provision of access to premises, including vehicles to which the general public has access.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation would also make unlawful discrimination in the provision of goods, facilities and services, covering the supply, and term of supply or provision, of goods and facilities and the provision of services including services relating to banking, insurance and the provision of grants, loans, credit or finance; services relating to entertainment, recreation or refreshment; services relating to transport, travel or telecommunications; services of any profession or trade; selling or leasing an interest in land; and services provided by a government, government authority or local government body. Discrimination relating to the provision of accommodation, including access to any benefits associated with accommodation, would also be unlawful.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation would mean that it would be unlawful for a club, the committee or management of a club, or a committee member, to discriminate on the ground of disability, including membership and access to the benefits associated with membership. The legislation would also apply to sporting and recreational activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation would cover administrative practices adopted by people charged with the administration of Commonwealth enactments, where the enactment does not itself authorise the discrimination. The legislation would make it unlawful to require another person to provide information on which unlawful discrimination might be based, unless the information is reasonably required for a lawful purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill provides for two general exemptions, unjustifiable hardship and the inherent requirements of the job. These exemptions will be very significant in terms of the overall effects of this legislation on service providers, businesses and employers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Bill employers, providers of accommodation, education, goods and services, clubs and sporting groups would be able to argue that action necessary to accommodate the needs of people with disabilities would impose unjustifiable hardship. In determining unjustifiable hardship, all of the relevant circumstances of a particular case would be taken into account. These circumstances would include the nature of the benefit or detriment likely to accrue or be suffered by any persons concerned, the effect of the impairment of the persons concerned and the financial circumstances and the estimated amount of expenditure required to be made by the person claiming unjustifiable hardship.  Any judgement made would allow for the financial viability of an employer having to meet additional costs, even where on the face of it, the costs would appear to be fairly small.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation would not require that people with disabilities be given jobs which they cannot do. Subsequently there is an exemption which does not prohibit discrimination if the person is not able to perform adequately the inherent requirements of the job, even where reasonable accommodation has been made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill contains a provision which requires the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to take into account the provision of any action plan lodged by a service provider or educational authority, when determining whether unjustifiable hardship exists in relation to a particular complaint. These plans are entirely voluntary but the Bill indicates that they shall include certain provisions if they are drawn up. These include policies and programs to achieve the objects of the Bill; the communication of those policies and programs to persons within the body preparing the plan; the setting of goals or targets against which the success of the plan may be measured; the means of evaluating the policies and programs developed; the revision of the plan; and the appointment of persons charged with the implementation of the plans. The plans would be lodged with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and would be publicly available. The Commission will not be required to agree to a plan lodged with it, but the plan will have to be considered by the Commission when determining whether unjustifiable hardship exists in the circumstance that a complaint is made against the particular agency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill makes it clear that once a complainant has been able to show that he or she has been subjected to unlawful discrimination, a respondent claiming unjustifiable hardship would bear an evidentiary burden. Similarly, an employer will have to determine what the inherent requirements of a particular job might be. However, the overall legal burden of proof, in proving discrimination unlawful, will remain with the complainant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Special exemptions include those special measures taken to assist people with disabilities to meet their particular needs; affirmative action measures which are designed to enable and encourage equality of opportunity; and insurance and superannuation where there is actuarial or statistical data to support a particular action. Acts done under Statutory Authority, in direct compliance with any other Acts, regulations, rules or by-laws, and acts done in accordance with determinations of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission would be exempt from the legislation for a period of three years. Special exemptions would also apply to infectious diseases; to participation in sporting activities for people with particular disabilities; the provision of pensions under specific Acts; and to the recruitment of certain defence force personnel. Further, an exemption of three years would apply to telecommunications to allow for the impact of the legislation on Telecom and the proposed second carrier to be properly assessed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Provision is also made for applications to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission for short term, renewable exemptions from all or parts of the legislation. The Commission would have the power to make interim determinations to preserve the status quo or the rights of the parties to a complaint.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Administration of the legislation would be vested in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The functions of the Commission would include holding inquiries into and making determinations on complaints; hearing applications for exemption from the Act; undertaking research and educational programs; and examination of existing and proposed legislation to ensure its consistency with the provisions of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill would establish a Disability Discrimination Commissioner who is required to investigate and conciliate complaints of discrimination on the ground of disability. The Commissioner would be empowered to dismiss a complaint if found to be unsubstantiated, or attempt to reach a settlement of the complaint. The Commissioner would have the power to summons witnesses to give evidence or produce documents and to call compulsory conferences. The aim of the legislation would be to promote resolution through conciliation wherever possible. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, where the Commissioner was unable to resolve a complaint by conciliation, he or she would have the power to refer the matter to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The Commission would then consider the complaint and make a determination on that complaint based on the requirements of the Act. The determination of the Commission would not of itself be binding. Should a party wish to enforce the determination of the Commission an application would be made to the Federal Court. That Court would then hear the matter again and make a legally binding judgement taking into account the same criteria taken into account by the Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also contains provisions to allow for the making of disability standards in the future. Equivalent standards are provided for in both the American and Canadian legislation of this sort. These standards would not be made without extensive consultations by the Commonwealth with all affected parties. The Bill contains provisions requiring that account be taken of comments by State and Territory governments before such standards are enacted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A national public education and awareness campaign will accompany the introduction of this legislation in order to raise the level of understanding of people with disabilities about their rights.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The direct financial implications of this legislation relate to the establishment of the Office of Disability Discrimination Commissioner, the public education and awareness campaign, some minor additional public service staffing and additional resources for support and representative agencies. This is expected to amount to approximately $5.5m in the first full year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Costs to Commonwealth agencies affected by the Bill are not easy to predict but on the basis of previous State experience are not expected to be significant and would occur over a lengthy period of time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of this Government's commitment to social justice for all Australian citizens, we have already passed legislation to provide protection for women and ethnic or racial groups who experience discrimination. It is now time to address the discrimination that people with disabilities have historically suffered. The introduction of this Bill is further evidence of the unwavering commitment of this Government to social justice for people with disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our vision is a fairer Australia where people with disabilities are regarded as equals, with the same rights as all other citizens, with recourse to systems that redress any infringements of their rights; where people with disabilities can participate in the life of the community in which they live, to the degree that they wish; where people with disabilities can gain and hold meaningful employment that provides wages and career opportunities that reflect performance; where control by people with disabilities over their own bodies, lives and future is assumed and ensured; where difference is accepted, and where public instrumentalities, communities and individuals act to ensure that society accommodates such difference. Only then will we be able to say that justice has been achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is therefore essential that there is a legislative basis to enable people with disabilities to participate in the economic, social and political spheres of the community and subsequently to determine the direction of their own lives. This legislation would be a vital element in removing the attitudinal, physical, structural and institutional barriers that people with disabilities currently face. The realisation of this Government's social justice goals for people with disabilities will benefit not only people with disabilities, but society as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Present at the introduction of this Bill in the House were members of the Disability Advisory Council of Australia and people who represent people with disabilities. This legislation is a major achievement for them, and it is a significant day for the Parliament when we are able to produce further legislation in terms of anti-discrimination that ensures we add to people's rights as citizens.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Yes. Although the Commonwealth's power to acquire a site would only be used as a last resort. Upon completion of site selection studies the Commonwealth would expect to negotiate access to a preferred site with parties having an interest in the selected site.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Yes. I doubt whether the Commonwealth has previously been accused of taking a precipitate approach or rushing headlong into this matter which has been under examination by the Commonwealth Government and State Governments for over a decade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4 &amp; 5) Yes. The Department is aware of criticism of shallow land burial facilities by environment groups in the United Kingdom and the United States. Such criticism largely refers to past practices and is of little relevance to shallow land burial under Australian conditions. The United Kingdom is continuing operations at its principal shallow land burial facility which will be supplemented in the future by an underground repository. Further shallow land burial facilities are proposed in the United States for low level and short-lived intermediate level radioactive wastes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Friends of the Earth would prefer that, instead of establishing a national repository in Australia, radioactive wastes be held in storage at the site where they are produced. This is not a practicable approach to management of the relatively small volume of radioactive wastes generated in Australia by the medical, research and industrial use of radionuclides. It would result in a multitude of small permanent storage sites in our cities where there is already considerable opposition to the interim storage of radioactive waste.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) Yes. The report examines essentially unregulated burial of radioactive wastes at the site of a number of nuclear fuel cycle facilities in the United States during their decommissioning. Its criticism of past practices in the United States is not relevant to the operation of a properly sited, purpose built repository in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) My Department is aware that siting of waste disposal facilities of any kind is a sensitive public issue and needs to be treated accordingly. However, the situation facing the United States where very large amounts of radioactive waste are produced by nuclear power stations, is quite different to that in Australia where there is a relatively small amount of radioactive waste arising from the medical, research and industrial use of radionuclides.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) As mentioned in (2) above, upon completion of site selection studies the Commonwealth Government will negotiate access to a preferred repository site. Field studies would then be conducted to confirm its suitability. I have not excluded the possibility that Aboriginal groups may be interested in negotiating the use of land by the Commonwealth for a national repository.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My reply to the following parts of the honourable senator's question is based on advice from the National Health and Medical Research Council Working Party on the draft Code of Practice for the Near-Surface Disposal of Radioactive Waste in Australia (1992) and its associated draft Guidelines. It should be noted that the Code and Guidelines are still in the draft stage and some of their detail, including quantitative criteria, may be subject to further changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) The correct value for tritium is 5xl0(12)Bq/kg derived by rounding the value 3.5X10(12) in Table 2 on page 17 of the draft Guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(10) The revised value for radium reflects the adoption of an alternative approach to containment of radon gas for the 1992 draft. The cover requirements for radioactive waste in a repository have been increased from 4 metres in the 1990 draft to 5 metres in the 1992 draft and also a layer of material specifically designed to inhibit radon diffusion has been included. The result of these changes is that the concentration limit for radium in radioactive wastes has increased.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(11) The draft Code of Practice specifies an institutional control period of 200 years compared with the US figure of 100 years. The half-life of tritium is 12.26 years. Thus, in the Australian case, tritium decays by more than two orders of magnitude in the extra 100 years permitting a higher initial concentration of tritium in radioactive wastes for a similar exposure at the end of the institutional control period. Had an institutional control period of 100 years been selected, the figure adopted would have been very similar to that of the US.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(12) Yes. The changes have been based on parameters considered appropriate to local conditions. The limit recommended in the draft document is derived for an arid zone site using exposure scenarios appropriate to that type of site. Not unexpectedly, this figure differs from those derived in other countries on the basis of different institutional control periods and different exposure scenarios. Furthermore, as outlined in Appendix F of the draft Guidelines, isotopes in unconditioned waste in the UK (Drigg site) and in Italy are grouped in broad categories with the limit for each category determined by the most radiotoxic isotope within the group. This results in a much more restrictive limit for tritium than would be justified solely on the basis of its relatively low radiotoxicity.</PARA>
