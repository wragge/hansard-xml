As I explained on a previous occasion when seeking leave to hold a hearing, the Committee is due to report by 1 March 1993 and, in order to meet its reporting date, needs to proceed with its inquiry as soon as possible. The Senate is scheduled to sit virtually continuously from now until it rises for the summer recess, and the Committee therefore sees no alternative to seeking leave to hold this hearing, which it regards as being essential to hold at the earliest possible stage.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 1992 has three key elements: firstly, continuation of the Australian Wheat Board's single desk status for export markets; secondly, extension of the Government's guarantee of the Australian Wheat Board's borrowings at 85 per cent of estimated net pool returns until June 1999; and, thirdly, the continued accumulation of the wheat industry fund until June 1999 to provide a capital base for the Australian Wheat Board, to provide working capital for its trading activities, to fund advances once the borrowing guarantee runs out, and for investment in value adding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill is the most significant legislation in relation to this great Australian industry since 1989, and probably will be until 1999, when some of the provisions of this legislation will be up for review or will be at the end of their period of application. The legislation confirms the Australian Wheat Board's export monopoly or single desk seller status at least until 1999. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is still no sunset provision for that power. The Bill overrides the phase-out of the borrowing guarantee of the current legislation which has to come down to 80 per cent by the 1994 harvest and then cease. The current legislation has no sunset provision for the Wheat Board's export power, so theoretically that matter does not arise. The reality is that over many years there have been five-year legislative schemes for the wheat industry. Therefore, for the sake of a feeling of security and confirmation for the wheat industry, it is wise and proper that continuing power be confirmed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one problem with this: the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Crean, in his second reading speech, indicated a proviso that, if the GATT round were successful or if progress were made following a successful GATT round, the matter would be reviewed. This means that, in general, this legislation is better than the 1989 legislation, which was to run until the 1994 harvest. There certainly is a need for such legislation because the grain trade war between the European Community and the United States is into one of its very severe phases again. We can look back to the other horror years of 1986 and 1990 when the export subsidies between those two countries in their chase for markets brought ruinous prices to Australian wheat growers, who were caught unfairly in the middle of that war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because this is better legislation, I commend the Government and the Grains Council of Australia, as the representative of the wheat industry, for achieving that better position. I would also like to commend my colleague in the House of Representatives, the honourable member for Murray, Bruce Lloyd, for bringing about this legislation. We do not expect such compliments from the Government and it is interesting that neither of these groups has in any way given any recognition to the key role that the coalition parties have played in obtaining this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that the very solid and stable policy position of the coalition parties is the major reason for this legislation now. Since 1989, and after discussion with the Grains Council of Australia, we have said that our policy would be not only the maintenance of the Australian Wheat Board's export power but also the second best option of the industry with regard to some form of security or underwriting for the industry, and that was underwriting at the 95 per cent rate which was determined at harvest time each year. That policy was confirmed for the 1990 election, and once again confirmed recently by the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would remind the Senate of the difference between a borrowing guarantee and an underwriting. They have the same starting point&mdash;that is, a harvest price is determined by the Wheat Board and ABARE, with the concurrence of the Minister, and that is basically a net price to farmers. The borrowing guarantee is then the aggregated estimate net pool return on the total crop. So an estimate is made of the size of the crop together with the price and then we have a total figure. That means that if the crop is larger, obviously the value of the borrowing guarantee falls in relation to what is guaranteed per tonne. Because the Wheat Board can never trigger any form of direct government backup assistance, the actual percentage borrowed by the Wheat Board is considerably lower. By the time we get down to 80 per cent, as it was going to be with the current legislation, we can question whether it has any real value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the 95 per cent underwriting, we start off with the  same figure. But it is a price per tonne underwriting, which means that it is underwritten irrespective of the size of the crop. The Wheat Board can better borrow for a higher harvest payment, the wheat grower can better deal with his bank manager and, in times of dramatic fall in price such as that which would occur with a world wheat war, after that price has been declared, the liability of the Government may be incurred&mdash;that is, the support of the Government may be needed to maintain that underwriting. On the calculations the coalition has made with the Wheat Board, that would have been the case in that terrible year of 1990 when it would have required a government advance of about $40m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since that 1989 legislation, and the difficult times with the international wheat wars, the Grains Council put two proposals to the Government to try to improve the situation: a base price proposal and a GMP proposal. That is, it attempted to negotiate some better stability for wheat growers. The Government rejected these proposals and the Grains Council then attempted to obtain some answers from the Government ahead of the forthcoming election as to what its attitude would be post-1994. The Grains Council also indicated that it would prefer to have legislation beyond 1994 in place before this election because of the uncertainty that it believed could prevail in the situation afterwards&mdash;the delays that would or could occur with any legislation which would bring it very close to the 1994 deadline and the need to provide some reassurance to the core markets for Australian wheat, which take up to about 70 per cent of our wheat and which provide the premium price. In other words, these markets buy at the ordinary rate and are not affected to the same degree by the EEP or EEC discounted prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Grains Council tried to obtain the Government's confirmation of what its policy would be, it could not obtain any confirmation whatsoever. There followed Grains 2000, the tripartite discussion group or committee made up of the Wheat Board, the Grains Council and the representatives of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. Out of that came the Newco proposal to give the export monopoly to a private organisation, to increase the wheat industry fund contributions because the capital would have to be built up more rapidly and to obtain some other special concessions with regard to taxation, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Grains Council, as the wheat growers' representative body, then embarked on a series of meetings around Australia. Out of those meetings there appeared to be misrepresentation of the coalition's policy. As a result of these misrepresentations, it became necessary for my colleague the honourable member for Murray, Mr Bruce Lloyd, to restate the coalition policy in stronger terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That better understanding by wheat growers of the policy and their greater recognition that</PARA>
<PARA>there was a better alternative&mdash;in spite of the fact that we had been regularly saying it for some time and had included it in our comparison documents between Fightback on the one hand and Government policy on the other&mdash;I believe encouraged the rejection by the industry of the Newco proposal. Our policy confirmed that the Grains Council of Australia should go back to the Government and negotiate a better arrangement. The Grains Council did so, and it obtained a better arrangement. I commend the Government and the Grains Council for that achievement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have just commented on the comparisons between the policies of the coalition and those of the Federal Labor Government. It is important to recognise that there are many differences in the area of primary industry policy and the way in which farmers will be affected. My colleague the shadow Minister for primary industries, Bruce Lloyd, has prepared two very interesting tables which draw out these comparisons between the policies of the coalition and of the Government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I return to the debate regarding the wheat marketing legislation. There is only one reason why the situation that I was alluding to before putting those tables on the record was possible. Throughout it all, since 1989, the coalition held firm on the two major elements of the policy: the retention of the Wheat Board's export monopoly and an underwriting arrangement, which is still better than the Government's improved position, which forms part of this legislation, of a constant 85 per cent borrowing guarantee through to the year 1999. Obviously, the deteriorating international situation has added some urgency to the legislation, and it has also provided another element for such legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation does buy time for the industry until 1999. By that time the wheat industry fund will have built up to between $400m and $500m, providing an adequate base for the industry if at that time there are changes to the marketing arrangements. Therefore, one would see that industry fund as a transitional arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am aware of concern in parts of the wheat industry, in particular in Western Australia, where it queries, on the one hand, the levy, and whether or not it will increase&mdash;and the Minister has indicated the procedure that is necessary before that can occur&mdash;and, on the other hand, its use for certain value adding activities. I am sure that my colleague Senator Panizza will comment in that regard. In Queensland there is concern&mdash;and I am sure that Senator Boswell will comment on this&mdash;but for a different reason, and that is because the capital provided for the trading activities of the Wheat Board is claimed by Queensland industry representatives to provide unfair competition against their own organisation, Grainco. Overall, there appears to be support for that wheat industry fund, but there is certainly concern that it should not increase beyond the 2 per cent, that it should be closely monitored and that it should be recognised as a transitional levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For some time the Wheat Board has indicated that there is a need for greater flexibility if it is to achieve what it and the wheat industry want to achieve with regard to sensible joint ventures and value adding. That has been the case for some time. Whether or not there is a need for a separate board, time will tell. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is something that the coalition will closely monitor, because we question whether there is such a need for a separate subsidiary company. But we are not trying to impose any sort of opposition to that element of the legislation, other than to monitor it from our point of view and the industry's point of view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition parties support this legislation. We recognise that it does come in time for the Wheat Board and the wheat industry to provide those guarantees for future contractual arrangements and harvests beyond the present one. As far as the coalition is concerned, the only change to the legislation between now and the review, which obviously will occur prior to 1999, will be a change to bring in our underwriting commitment for the 1994 and subsequent harvests. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 1992. Perhaps I can tell the Senate the official reason for the introduction of this Bill. To do so, I can do no better than to quote from the second reading speech of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean). The Minister said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this Bill is to implement a package of measures to enhance the future of the Australian wheat industry. The package provides a framework for the development of a vertically integrated industry to the end of the century. It has the endorsement of the peak wheat grower body, the Grains Council of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the official reason, but I believe that the real reason for amending the Wheat Marketing Act 1989 is the failed Newco proposal that was propounded by the Minister and the Grains Council of Australia. I have never really been able to get to the bottom of who proposed it, whether it came from the supposed peak body or whether it came from the Minister himself imposing his views on the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators may remember that the Wheat Marketing Act 1989 did away with the regulated domestic market. I believe that that has been a positive move. The Wheat Marketing Act gave the Australian Wheat Board sole marketing rights to export wheat, and rightly so. As well, the underwriting fee levied by the industry was reduced by 2.5 per cent per year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The idea of Newco was to set up a private organisation with sole overseas marketing rights for Australian wheat, as well as the right to deal in the domestic market. The problem with the Government giving sole export marketing to a private organisation was very apparent to the industry at large in that the arrangement would not stand up to a High Court challenge. The private grain exporters would certainly have knocked that arrangement over in a High Court action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Tambling has stated, the Grains Council of Australia, with the Minister, set up meetings around Australia. Unfortunately, there was a lot of misinformation put out at those meetings. Fortunately, however, Opposition members and senators were able to attend those meetings. They put to the meetings the coalition's proposals for the industry and were able to put the meetings straight. The coalition position was being misrepresented. In fact, the growers were being told that the coalition's position was exactly the same as that of the Government. Nothing could be further from the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's position, as Senator Tambling has already said, is to return to 95 per cent of underwriting of the borrowings, thus allowing the AWB to be able to pay a reasonable first advance. That is the position that we arrived at. The Minister, in his second reading speech, also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I had earlier expressed reservations about aspects of the proposal.</PARA>
<PARA>This was after those meetings&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Moreover, after the consultative process was complete, it was clear that the Newco proposal in its original form did not have the support of the majority of growers&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>No, it did not. I attended three of the meetings in Western Australia and my colleague, the honourable member for O'Connor, Wilson Tuckey, attended the fourth meeting. He caused a furore when he put the coalition position. I saw only two growers out of probably 1,000 to 1,400 growers put their hands up. That could hardly be described as majority support. I would say that it was the understatement of the year. There was another point that I wanted to make. The Minister further said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the question of the Wheat Board's export monopoly, it is clear that the majority of growers favour the continuation of the Wheat Board's single desk export operations.</PARA>
<PARA>Once again, on that question, at all the meetings held in Western Australia only two growers voted against the single desk operation. I think that that is also an understatement. Of course, on that point, as Senator Tambling has already said, while there is a corrupt world market we have to keep that sole export. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, Newco and the GCA having failed in the growers meetings, the Minister came up with the present proposal. Basically, the present proposal is to retain until 1999 what we brought into this Parliament in 1989. As has already been pointed out, the underwriting is to go back to 85 per cent of the estimated pool return, whereas under the coalition it would be 95 per cent. Sole export powers are to stay, as I have already said. The Minister is not very definite in this regard in his second reading speech and I will be asking questions later in the committee stage to see how definite he is as far as the AWB retaining the sole export market is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the big push by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Crean, towards value adding of the grain crop of Australia. I ask: how much can we really value add wheat? I can do no better than to quote from an article by one of my colleagues, Senator Peter Walsh&mdash;a colleague in wheat growing, I may add. I could probably say that he is a colleague in this place most of the time. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The economic viability of further processing or adding value to raw materials is dependent upon the relative internal cost of processing and the freight savings which accrue to reducing the volume and weight of raw materials.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thus, Australian bauxite is converted to alumina or aluminium. Copper is always concentrated or smelted before being exported. But the economics of processing wheat are vastly different. . . Further processing of wheat invariably increases its bulk and at best marginally reduces its weight.</PARA>
<PARA>If the bulk of the value added product is greater than the original bulk of grain, then there are no freight advantages; there are many freight disadvantages. As Senator Walsh says in the article, 30 years ago a big proportion of the Australian wheat crop was exported as flour. That is no longer the case. Anyone who travels around Australia will see disused flour mills. Some are derelict; others have been turned into other outfits, like seed cleaning outfits. The main reason for the decline was the freight cost. By the mid-1960s, freight costs took off. I quote Senator Walsh again:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Possibly a levy on wheat sales could fund offshore capital investment in wheat processing in the hope that this would maximise Australian wheat sales and returns.</PARA>
<PARA>The precedents have been set with the Australian Dairy Corporation. More disastrous lately has been the wool industry, where a levy on growers was used. Basically, that is how I view value adding in Australia. So much for the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the real bone of contention in Western Australia that was flagged by my colleague Senator Grant Tambling and that is the wheat industry fund. A deal was done in 1989 between the Grains Council of Australia, our supposed peak body, and the Minister whereby we were to try to build up a fund of $400m to help fund the first advance after which this underwriting by the Government was to be done away with. Those contributions were 2 per cent of gross, which might not seem a lot to people in this chamber but which has a big effect on the ultimate net profits of a farmer. The fund is also going to be used for value adding. There is much resentment in being forced into value adding. After all, if someone wants to invest in value adding, he has a proper structure, a prospectus, a board of directors and all those sorts of things before he gets into it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If value adding for wheat in Australia were so good, private enterprise would take it up without a levy from the wheat growers and that would be it; that would be sweet. What worries a lot of growers in Western Australia is that the fund is compulsory. Growers who are in strife, who have been forced out of farming and that sort of thing, still have money in that fund but cannot get it out. There are farmers who have gone into bankruptcy who have certain moneys in the fund which they cannot get out. If they have become bankrupt and have gone off the farm they have problems in getting social security, Jobstart or anything like that. A particular grower was on the phone to tell me that he has been knocked back for Jobstart because he has a certain amount of money in the fund which he cannot get out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, there is a problem when a grower dies leaving money in the fund that his family cannot get hold of. When a farmer gets out of the industry altogether, sells his land and gets out, there is a problem with this money in the fund that he cannot get out. I know of no other situation, whether it be superannuation or anything like that, where, if people get out of a job or an industry, they cannot take their money with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition listened to these people who came over from Western Australia to lobby. We decided at our coalition grains committee that we should go down the line perhaps of moving an amendment to this Bill to make it possible to get those funds out for those growers who are affected. We came up with a draft amendment that I prepared. Until the Minister does something about getting funds out for other reasons, for the present moment the amendment deals with money being paid out in the case of the death of a farmer. I have been told by some people that in the case of death the money will not do much good for the individual, but certainly it will be of use to the family. I have also been told, in the case of a bankruptcy, that it does not do the bankrupt much good because the money finishes up with the banks anyhow. Not all banks chase the money that is owed. But, of course, if they did, it would cut down the indemnity to the bank, and those people would be able to get out of bankruptcy sooner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is the situation when a farmer gets out of the industry by selling his land. I am not referring to a case of a farmer growing wheat for one year, selling, and moving to another property; I am referring to those who want to get out for one reason or another, who cannot see any future in it and want to go and just change their industry. One particular ex-farmer in Western Australia told me that he has $18,000 in this fund from which he cannot get a cent, yet he is living in rented accommodation in Perth. With $18,000 he would at least have the deposit for a home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, I prepared a draft amendment. We had discussions with the Grains Council of Australia about the proposed amendment. That Council thought there may be a better way to go than amending this Bill in the committee stage. Basically, it agreed with our proposals and said that it would be better for it to go to the Minister to talk about changing the regulations because we are all on the same course. To date I have accepted what the Grains Council of Australia has said, that it will do the right thing, and that the Minister will do the right thing. I was hoping that the regulations would already be before the Parliament when this Bill came in. I do not think they are here yet, so I will ask the Minister in the committee stage what sort of assurances we will get. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have here a letter from the Grains Council of Australia to our shadow Minister discussing our proposals and giving us some of those assurances.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In respect of the management of WIF equity, the following are "on the agenda".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.Determination to make a payment in special circumstances</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">death</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Eligibility criteria need to be determined.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.Determination to make a payment in "necessitous" circumstances</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Eligibility criteria need to be determined (we are advised that in some cases farmers in Western Australia are being denied the Job Search Allowance because WIF equity is regarded as an asset for the assets test in determining eligibility.) An example of "eligibility" may be the granting of Job Search Allowance or Part C funding under RAS. In these circumstances it could be argued that the individual is likely to retire or leave the industry anyway.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.Disenchanted growers</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">By this category we are attempting to identify those growers who do not want to contribute to the WIF or want to fully realise their WIF equity and exit from the Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.Disenfranchised growers</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">By this we mean, quite literally, growers who do not get a vote. As you know, WIF equity holders do not have voting rights like normal shareholders. However, unless a grower is a member of one of the Grains Council's State affiliates, he technically does not have the capacity to exercise, through the GCA, the power of veto over the use of Fund monies.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I hasten to add that the Grains Council considers that it represents the interests of WIF equity holders, regardless of whether they are members of GCA State affiliated organisations. As such, the Council takes into consideration any representation to it by WIF equity holders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">NECESSITY FOR LEGISLATIVE CHANGES</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The WIF Regulations currently make provision for determination of a payment to be made equitably on a pro rata basis across equity holders. Indeed, you will recall that the Regulations were recently amended to accommodate the concerns of a Parliamentary Sub Committee to ensure that when a determination to make a payment was made, the distribution of funds be made equitably. (The amendments to the Regulations merely served to formalise existing WIF operating rules drafted by the AWB in consultation with the GCA, and adhered to by AWB management.) There is no provision within the Regulations for discriminating between equity holders when a determination to make a payment of WIF equity is made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To accommodate agenda items numbers 1 and 2 that is, "special" and "necessitous" circumstances, a change to WIF Regulations will be required. Section 94 of the Principal Act makes provision for amendments to the Regulations in respect of management of the Fund. S.94(4) stipulates that Regulations relating to the management of the Fund "may not be made except after consideration by the Minister of a report by the Grains Council, made after consultation with the Board".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The "Panizza amendment", in seeking to amend the Act would require an amendment to the WIF Regulations to provide for the cashing out of WIF equity of growers who "cease to be wheat growers". In other words, the Principal Act would "compel" an amendment to the Regulations along these lines, rather than leaving that to the discretion of the Minister and the Council. It would in fact override Subsections 93(3) ". . . the Regulations may make provision. . . " and 94(4). (By the way, the amendment seeks to amend the wrong section of the Act. It ignores the amendment to s.83 (28.12.90), which transfers the power to make Regulations in respect of the Wheat Industry Fund to s.94.)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no necessity to amend the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 1992 to achieve either the "Panizza amendment" or provisions for "special and/or necessitous circumstances", which the Council is currently addressing. These can be achieved after due and proper deliberation by the Grains Council of Australia, in consultation with the AWB, subsequently the Minister, and then amendments to the Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even if the Bill currently before the Parliament was amended in the form proposed, the Grains Council would still need to make policy decisions to enable it to provide guidance to the AWB as managers of the Fund in defining the eligibility criteria for "ceasing to be a wheat grower".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Obviously death is an absolute definition. However, "retirement", "ceasing farming", or "ceasing wheat production" are all conditions which can be reversed. As such, there will always be a degree of ambiguity in determining eligibility for the realisation of WIF equity on the basis of "ceasing to be a wheat grower". It is this area of policy development which requires some consideration by the Council, in consultation with the Australian Wheat Board, including the Fund managers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In respect of agenda items numbers 3 and 4, provisions already exist with the legislation to accommodate the "disenchanted" and/or "disenfranchised" growers. The Regulations make provision for WIF equity holders to either trade or transfer their equity. The Grains Council has identified that although the "power" already exists under the current Act, and will remain after successful passage of the Amendment Bill, it needs to take steps to facilitate an active trade in WIF paper. As I said earlier, this is already on the agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In summary Bruce, the objectives of my Council and what I perceive to be the objectives of the "Panizza amendment" are in accord. However, to ensure that proper consideration is given to determining eligibility criteria for WIF equity holders cashing out their equity on the basis of "ceasing to be a wheat grower", and to the other provisions I have mentioned, the industry needs time and the flexibility provided by the existing legislation. My Council sees little gain in circumscribing the flexibility of the industry, by virtue of the Panizza amendment in the manner in which the industry requires the Fund to be managed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So far in this debate, Senator Tambling has spent a considerable amount of the Senate's time outlining the purpose and history of the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 1992. I suggest that these details can be found, almost verbatim, in the speech made by the honourable member for Murray, Mr Lloyd, during the second reading debate in the House of Representatives. A considerable amount of this material is fact and cannot be contested; it certainly would not be contested by me. We agree with the description of the history and path that these proposals have taken before arriving here as legislation. I would not contest Senator Tambling's description of it at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation deserves support and I am pleased to see that it has coalition support. It is interesting to note that that support recognises the fact that unity is strength in world marketing and that individual negotiators have the capacity to allow buyers to play one off against the other to negotiate against the best interests of Australia. In supporting the legislation, the coalition agrees with us and the Government that a diversity of negotiators would, by definition, place those negotiators in a very weak position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What surprises me is that the coalition can happily take that position with regard to a whole range of primary industry matters but that when it comes to industrial relations we find exactly the opposite being espoused: that is, individual negotiations are the model to be followed. In other words, it is each person for himself or herself. Survival of the fittest is appropriate for workers, but it is not appropriate for growers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree that it is not appropriate for primary producers to have to venture into the world market to negotiate sales terms on their own behalf. Any sort of legislation or regulation that establishes a system which is not that chaotic jungle of survival of the fittest is what it is all about and what sophisticated world trade has become. The precise subject of all the GATT negotiations is what countries will do rather than what individual marketeers will do. It is hypocritical for the coalition not to recognise how inappropriate that model is in industrial relations. To finally wake up to that would be a denouement which the coalition should be seeking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not all the coalition's proposals are inconsistent. In fact, Senator Panizza's concerns about the fund and access to it by contributors who find themselves in extraordinary circumstances are, I believe, real concerns which need to be addressed before this legislation leaves this place; either through the support of the honourable senator's proposition that suitable regulations ought to be drafted to deal with the situations he described, or, if such regulations are not forthcoming, there should be serious consideration of his draft amendment. I indicate here that the Australian Democrats would consider supporting such amendments if suitable regulations were not forthcoming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I indicated at the beginning, we have had a good exposition by Senator Tambling of the general thrust of the legislation. I do not propose to repeat that. I simply say that the confirmation of the Australian Wheat Board's export monopoly, or single desk seller status, until at least 1999 is something that we support. We were entertained by the prospect of grower owned cooperatives being established, but that is not the proposition before us now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation, in its general thrust, is what has been negotiated through the peak bodies and it is therefore not contested by us.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are addressing the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill. We have just heard from Senator Panizza, a well-known wheat grower from Western Australia who has expressed some concerns about the wheat industry fund. I wish to acknowledge the presence in the gallery of the general manager of the Grains Council of Australia, Mr Mitch Hooke, who has come to listen to the debate on this Bill. It is very nice to see him here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill formalises the changes to the Australian Wheat Board announced by the Government in October. It follows three years of work by the Grains Council, Grains 2000, the working party, the Newco discussions and the months of industry discussions throughout the country on the future of the Australian wheat industry. I attended many of those discussions in Queensland, which were held in Dalby and many other places where the growers came to discuss the future of their industry. They discussed marketing, financial arrangements and the differences of opinion between the various States. Those discussions and meetings took place in small towns all over Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill is a result of the decisions made by those farmers through their industry organisations and taken to the Government. In the end the Government endorsed a scheme for the industry which will result in the Government guaranteeing the Wheat Board's borrowings at 85 per cent of the estimated net pool returns. That is in contrast to the Government's previous scheme to reduce the AWB borrowing guarantee to 80 per cent in 1994 and then terminate the guarantee altogether. The Bill also retains the single desk export powers of the Australian Wheat Board. Those two decisions&mdash;and particularly the decision to retain the export power of the Australian Wheat Board&mdash;are very big wins for the Australian wheat industry. In fact, if the Government had not supported those measures, the wheat industry would have been in a very seriously weakened position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation does not come up to the coalition's policy of 95 per cent underwriting, but the coalition still supports the Bill&mdash;and gives great support to the retention of the Wheat Board's single desk export powers, which are a vital life force for the Australian wheat industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill also grants to the Board a new power to engage, through a subsidiary arrangement, in value adding activities, using in part funds from the wheat industry fund. The wheat industry fund comprises moneys from a 2 per cent levy on gross receipts of the wheat industry. Senator Panizza has some worries about people exiting the industry. It is good to note that Senator Panizza has prepared an amendment. However, he will not proceed with it today because he believes that the Grains Council will take the matter up with the Minister at the relevant time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the end of the Second World War to recently, the Wheat Board has operated under a system which lifted the wheat industry to the point where it grew to rival the prosperous wool industry. It also saw the growth of infrastructure through the railways, grain handling facilities and ports&mdash;all owned and purchased by farmers through levies on their industry. This successful system included single desk export selling, underwriting or some similar scheme to ensure certainty of minimum expected harvest returns at planting time; a guarantee of AWB borrowings to pay growers' first advances; harvest payments; and regulation of the domestic market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, in recent years the Australian wheat industry has become the innocent victim of lower commodity prices from the billion dollar trade war between the EC and the US.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that they are down at the moment, Senator, but the repercussions of those high interest rate years are still being felt in rural Australia. The industry has had to fight drought very hard. A viable and successful wheat industry is of vital importance to Australia. It is fortunate for Australia that the Government changed its mind on its wheat policy and will retain single desk selling and not end the AWB's borrowing guarantees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was the National-Liberal policy of strict adherence to single desk selling status for the Australian Wheat Board that, I believe, forced the Government to back down and adopt the same policy. The Government knew that once the coalition was firm on Australian single desk selling the Democrats would not move and therefore it would be defeated in this place. Rather than be defeated, the Government agreed to retain the single best selling policy. The farmers of Australia owe the coalition a lot because we were the ones who remained rock solid to the single desk market selling that put the pressure right on the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Four of the world's five major wheat exporting countries have single desk selling, the exception being Argentina. Australia's efficient and unsubsidised wheat industry has to survive in a very distorted world trading situation. Seventy per cent of the world grain trade is imported by single desk buyers, 80 per cent is exported by single desk selling systems and 60 per cent of all wheat sales are subsidised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia, our single desk selling has ensured long term stability for the industry. It has led to increased efficiencies by making possible reforms in handling and freight. All major buying countries operate through single government or quasi-government buying agencies. In the US and the EC there are massive grower income support schemes. Canada has a wheat board plus an insurance scheme. If people want to debate whether there are subsidies and government assistance, they should go and have a look at the Canadian system. The Canadian Government virtually ensures farmers' income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia we have lost the regulated domestic market and underwriting to a degree. The only thing left is single desk selling. Let us compare the figures for 1990. In the US, 135,000 cereal growers received $4.2 billion in wheat payment support; in Australia 45,000 wheat growers received $200m. A report from the US General Accounting Office concluded that Australian wheat farmers were more exposed to international wheat prices and received less government support than in any other major wheat exporting country and noted that it was being reduced even further. It concluded that Australian producer subsidy levels were 11 per cent, whereas subsidy levels were 43 per cent in Canada, 44 per cent in the US and 46 per cent in the EC. Let it be said once and for all that the Australian wheat grower is probably the least subsidised of any wheat grower in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian assistance included in the calculation were RAS, Government research funding, tax concessions and export incentives, Government underwriting of Wheat Board borrowings and Government insurance cover on credit sales. All of these measures are acceptable under GATT, unlike the massive subsidies paid to our major competitors in the US, the EC and Canada. Despite the massive subsidies poured into the US industry, it has only succeeded in cutting its own margin. Its market share has only risen slightly from 29 per cent to 31 per cent and the subsidies are only reducing prices in the markets it already owns. These same subsidies are wreaking havoc on world prices and the Australian industry. A report of the US General Accounting Office totally refuted US traders' claims that the operations of the Australian Wheat Board constituted unfair competition. The Government, in changing its mind on single desk selling for the Australian Wheat Board, recognised the reality of the corrupt world markets in the grain industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government should now give the same assurance to the sugar industry. The international sugar market is totally distorted by massive subsidies, which in turn corrupt the international sugar price. The Government should give the sugar industry certainty for its future by rejecting the Industry Commission's recommendation to end single desk selling by 1993. The Industry Commission's final report on the sugar industry recommended that acquisition continue only for long term contracts and that this should also end by 1997. The Government has said nothing about the threat to the sugar industry arising from the removal of its single desk marketing arrangements. I think that the sugar industry is a very important industry to Australia and it should be treated equally with the wheat industry in the maintenance of its one desk selling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By contrast, the coalition has said that it will not interfere with sugar industry issues which traditionally and constitutionally have been the province of the Queensland Government. The international market and price for the Australian sugar industry is also corrupted. Just as in the wheat industry, the effect of lowered world sugar prices from massive subsidies corrupting world prices is very clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the massive subsidies in the international grain market, just this September, President Bush announced that 30 million tonnes of US wheat&mdash;almost the entire US export crop&mdash;would be highly subsidised under a major expansion of its export enhancement program. Thirty million tonnes equates to one-third of the world's wheat trade. The total value will be worth more than $4.19 billion in commodity sales to the US. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, there has been an 11 per cent reduction in world grain prices from the US subsidy scheme. US subsidies have robbed Australian grain export earnings of $300m a year since 1986 when EEP started. The cost of EC protection in 1990-91 to Australian wheat and grain producers was $695m. If we equate that with the 45,000 grain growers in Australia at the moment, we will understand why many of those people are finding extreme financial hardships on their farms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Wheat Board estimates that it costs between $120 to $150 to produce a tonne of wheat. This includes the cost of storage, handling and transport. The agreement reached between the US and the EC on oilseed and further Uruguay Round discussions could be a great breakthrough for the grain growers of Australia who have been the most severely affected by the ongoing trade war between the US and the EC. Australian grain growers have really suffered in recent years with negative incomes of the magnitude of minus $30,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many seasons of negative income are disastrous to any industry and our wheat industry has been and continues to be an innocent victim of the American export enhancement subsidy program and the EC CAP program. ABARE has predicted that the effect of implementing the Dunkel package in the Uruguay Round will mean that world wheat, corn and other coarse grains prices with rise in the medium term by 22 per cent for wheat, 12 per cent for corn and 13 per cent for coarse grain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that Queensland growers have taken a terrible battering from the sacrifices that they have made as part of our commitment to the success of the Uruguay Round which far exceed the GATT requirements. Let us hope that these sacrifices have not been made in vain and that there is a speedy conclusion to the GATT round. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Queensland industry, like the whole of the industry, has worked with the proposals that are implemented in this Bill. Growers have accepted world conditions and have done all they can to cut costs and value add where possible. The industry has looked for all available opportunities. At a meeting that I attended not so long ago one of the growers said to the Chairman, `We have done everything to create efficiencies on the farm. It has got to the point where our wives have to go to work to earn off-farm income'. That is how bad it is out there. The wives are now having to take jobs in the towns to supplement farm incomes in order to keep the farms going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite great export potential in South East Asia in the future there will also be tremendous competition with Australia for these growing markets. To this end, the industry's future will require a totally national approach overall&mdash;possibly with State marketing and handling facilities being brought together, as suggested by the Queensland industry&mdash;with a proper strategic direction for the whole wheat industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry has kept pace with developments. There are 40 segregations of wheat out of Australia. Each one of these categories is broken up into different contents. That is value adding. I am sure Mr Hooke, who is in the public gallery, would agree with that. By comparison, the Americans have only two segregations. There is a particular commodity for a particular market, such as turning wheat into pasta, flour and gluten. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry is also involved in value adding activities such as the Moscow bakeries, Egyptian silos and the Shenzen free economic zone in China. Some of the industry funds will go to develop these markets in foreign countries. They will give us not only top money for the product, but also access to markets. I commend the Grain Council and the Wheat Board for establishing a way to open up markets for the Australian wheat product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry must look offshore, as the domestic industry is fairly mature. There are probably no gaps to develop further markets for wheat in Australia at the moment&mdash;they would be well and truly looked after by private enterprise. The wheat industry fund is being put to the benefit of these ventures and is doing exactly what it was designed to do. The wheat industry fund is establishing a capital base to facilitate growers investing beyond the farm gate so that they have more control over their product and its returns. All these steps are essential for the future growth and viability of our most important wheat industry. I have pleasure in supporting this Bill and wish the Australian wheat industry a secure and successful future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 1992. Senator Tambling, Senator Boswell and Senator Panizza have all spoken on this Bill, so there is not a lot more for me to say. It should be repeated that this Bill continues the single desk export status of the Australian Wheat Board; it extends the Government's guarantee of the Wheat Board's borrowings at 85 per cent; it allows the continuation of the wheat industry fund until June 1999; and it allows the AWB to form a subsidiary to provide value adding grains based services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is rather unusual that, for once, the rural industry legislation is not being debated at the last minute. This Bill has been prepared in advance of the June 1994 borrowing timetable. However, that needs to be looked at in context. It was not the Government that provided the impetus for this legislation; it was the grain industry itself, which, like a great many other industries, has been pushing the Government to find out what the Labor Party's policies are for the future of the industry. I commend the Grains Council of Australia. It is good to see Mr Hooke, having been part of the negotiations for this legislation, sitting in the gallery today and following it right through. I commend that to other people in the community who have legislation going through this place; they should follow the legislation right through. They should play a part in the whole legislative process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real benefit of this legislation is that it gives direction and confidence to the wheat industry to look a little further into the future. Given the parlous state of the industry, which is under attack from within and outside Australia&mdash;and this has been very clearly put by previous speakers in relation to EEP and the European Community&mdash;this legislation is very welcome. I have always said that a single seller selling to a multitude of buyers is in a much stronger position than multiple sellers selling to a single buyer. With this legislation we will have single desk selling, which will allow our wheat industry in Australia to have a little bit of power that it would not have had otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The grain industry has had some horror years. As I have said, when wheat growers have not been contending with drought and other internal difficulties, they have been caught in the cross-fire of the trade wars between the two big conglomerates: the EC and the United States of America. We are still caught in that cross-fire. I believe that the industry has responded well to the challenges that continued failure of the GATT negotiations has provided. Hopefully, GATT now has a glimmer of hope, although I heard on the news this morning that 60,000-odd French farmers are protesting. It is nice to know that we in Australia have single desk selling to keep a little bit of strength in our industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to remember where the Australian wheat industry fits into the world grain scene. In all, Australian wheat production is around 15 million tonnes, although this has fluctuated in recent years: it went from 22 million tonnes in 1983-84 to 12 million tonnes in 1987-88. This compares with the might of the US, which produces 74 million-odd tonnes. In other words, Australia's entire annual crop is equivalent to the annual fluctuations in the United States of America crop. On that basis, we are very much the mouse that roars, when it comes to bluffing and pushing our rights to markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, Australia has become a resilient and skilful marketer of wheat through the expertise of the AWB. We have developed niche markets so that we can target our product to suit a particular customer. I commend our grain industry bodies for having done that. For the interest of people here, Australian wheat has 40 different classifications compared with the United States of America, which has recently doubled its classifications on white wheat from one to two. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I believe that we are world leaders and I think we should be proud of the fact that we are looking for niche markets. We are going in and selling to specific markets in a specific way. It is really our quality versus some of the other countries' quantity. Some countries might dispute that. The United States might like to dispute it. But it is a fact of life that Australia has the highest quality wheat in the world. That is something that we should be really proud of. It is nice to see Senator Collins smiling and agreeing with that. </PARA>

But, as a person who has grown wheat for a long time, I can assure Senator Collins that it is a great industry. It needs to have that bit of stability and the strength of single desk selling in order to compete with multinationals around the world who would take us to the cleaners if we did not have the strength of single desk selling.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provisions allow the Wheat Board to expand its functions to enable it to form subsidiaries and other mechanisms to benefit from value adding activities. I believe this is an important step. Senator Panizza referred to the point made by Senator Walsh that value adding of flour is not always the way to go. I will elaborate on how I believe value adding should be undertaken in Australia to benefit all the wheat growers, the community at large and Australia. Flour is not always the way to value add. Perhaps we should value add with biscuits. We have the Campbells-Arnotts' saga at the moment. Maybe the way to go would be to make more biscuits with our wheat and then sell those biscuits to South East Asia. But I do not think the way to go would be to sell the flour to South East Asia for the manufacture of biscuits over there. It would be much better for us to do it here ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For too long farmers and their boards have tended to navel gaze a little too much. Perhaps in years past the old farm gate responsibility was sufficient. The farmer believed his responsibility stopped once the product&mdash;be it wool, wheat or beef&mdash;hit the farm gate. He received his money then and he was happy with the arrangement. We cannot do that any longer. We have to have a marketing sophistication. Farmers, along with others, have to learn to position and market their product better. In order to remain competitive, on-farm productivity gains have had to be matched by equivalent improvements off-farm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Clauses 5 to 7 of the Bill provide the AWB with the powers to do that. Clause 5(b) amends the principal Act `to enable it to process, manufacturer or undertake other value adding activities, as well as trade in, wheat and grains based products'. I must say that I always worried a little about the Wheat Board when it started to trade on the domestic market because, in some cases, it undercut some of the smarter growers. But I think the smarter growers have worked out how they can handle that. They are either doing it through the Wheat Board or through direct selling to their people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I add one word of caution. I hope that the Wheat Board uses its commonsense when spending growers' funds and does not speculate too unwisely in chasing new markets and new products. Although I am saying we have to find our niche markets, I do not think we should spend the money willy-nilly in an undirected way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, while this legislation is a step in the right direction, it does not match what the Opposition's policies will do for the industry. I think that needs to be made pretty clear to the chamber today. The coalition's policies for wheat are clearly more appropriate for the industry and are preferred by the industry. For example, even on the question of underwriting our policies are superior. We have undertaken to maintain the 95 per cent underwriting on price per tonne, unlike the Government's 85 per cent, scaling down to 80 per cent, based on total borrowings. In some years that could mean a significant difference to the growers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other benefits that will accrue to the industry cannot be overlooked either. We have to talk about Fightback, which is our vision for the future of Australia, especially of agriculture. It actually will make a fantastic difference&mdash;something like $1 billion in savings to agriculture alone on-farm. I think that is going to be a great help. All goods and services taxes on farm inputs will be fully refundable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax component of all the various farming inputs will be fully rebated or fully refunded&mdash;from the machinery, the trucks and the chemicals used on-farm, through to the off-farm transport savings. The contractor who collects the grain will have cheaper fuel&mdash;26c a litre cheaper. This is a big saving when he is putting 1,000 litres in the tank at a time. His truck will cost less. It has been estimated that a $200,000 truck will cost $30,000 less. The tyres of the truck will also be cheaper than they are at present. Senator Panizza referred to the point made by Senator Walsh that, while he was worried about flour in the context of value adding, there were big cost savings to be made in the transport industries. All of those taxes will be abolished in respect of land transport. According to the Road Transport Forum and Treasury estimates, wholesale sales taxes add about $1.2 billion a year to the costs of transport. </PARA>

If the Minister could put a photographic image of the Government's tax chain in his mind, he would see that, at every level&mdash;from the farm through to the consumer&mdash;the Government's wholesale sales taxes are adding on costs.

I think that is a step in the right direction. Not only will this Bill help Australia, but also the industry will get help when there is a change of government at the next election and Fightback is implemented. The real value adding for the wheat industry will manifest itself in the fact that all those savings which I have outlined will be made from the farm gate through to the export at the waterfront. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;(10.52 a.m.)&mdash;I would like to make a number of points about the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 1992 and some observations about the wheat industry in general. The first point relates to the importance of the single desk selling status which is being retained in this Bill. Some 12 months ago&mdash;and it was highlighted very much in my State of Western Australia, as I am sure Senator Panizza has mentioned&mdash;there was a series of public grower meetings at which the Newco proposal was floated. It was comprehensively rolled by growers. The thing that concerned Western Australian growers in particular&mdash;and it must be borne in mind that Western Australia is, on a consistent basis, producing close to half the nation's wheat&mdash;was that part of the hidden agenda of the Newco proposal was to get rid of the single desk selling status.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are now operating in corrupt world markets. We cannot be certain that there has been a quick breakthrough in terms of GATT and the discussions that have been going on, particularly when one saw this morning's television news showing the demonstrations that are taking place, with towns being pulled down and places being burnt down in France, which was rather horrific. We cannot be certain that we are going to see major changes quickly, but they will continue to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The single seller status is extremely important for two principal reasons. Firstly, 70 per cent of the world's wheat is traded on a direct government to government or government agency to government agency basis. Secondly, the single seller status is particularly important to Australia because 80 per cent of our wheat is sold under a direct government to government or government agency to government agency basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the way in which the world wheat trade operates. It will continue to operate that way while we have the mass subsidisation which is occurring in Europe and America, whether it be through direct subsidy inputs to production or by such things as EEP, under which export subsidies are paid to increase sales. So, for that reason, the single desk status is crucial to the survival of the wheat industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In round figures, Australia provides about 10 per cent of the world's traded wheat&mdash;10 million to 11 million tonnes of the 100 tonnes traded&mdash;but we provide two-thirds of the white wheats that are traded around the world. Approximately 85 million tonnes of red wheat and 15 million of white wheat are traded. Of course, white wheat is a better quality wheat than the red wheats. White wheat, whether soft or hard, gives more millable flour, contains less moisture and produces a better end product when processed for bread, noodles or whatever. Therefore Australia enjoys a quality advantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to mention the wheat industry fund. While I support very strongly the wheat industry moving towards being able to finance its own operations in terms of first advances or minimum guaranteed prices, which I think is very desirable and very wise, I would also like to give a warning to the wheat industry and to the legislators about mixing in value adding. With this there is the danger&mdash;we saw it happen in the wool industry&mdash;that large licks of money put together in good times can be misused when things get a bit tougher. If the moneys from the wheat industry fund are to be used for commercial activities outside of providing a guaranteed minimum price, it must be done only on two bases: firstly, that studies are carried out into whether there is potential in a particular project that can be promoted; and, secondly, that it clearly be a commercial operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I emphasise that it must clearly be a commercial operation, because the last thing wheat growers want and the last thing they should have to do is to subsidise commercial operations in the marketplace. As the Government is guaranteeing borrowings until 1999, it is very important that operations financed through the wheat industry fund be on a commercial basis. I think they should have to be super-commercial. We cannot have individuals getting carried away because they think something is a good idea. At the end of the day, it will be the wheat growers who have put those funds aside who will pay the price. I am sure that Senator Panizza would agree with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention one matter with regard to the wheat industry fund that I believe is going to be handled by regulation. It concerns people leaving the industry. If a grower has made his contribution to the fund over a number of years and then leaves the industry, I think it only fair and reasonable that he should be able to get his funds back. We on this side of the chamber will be watching the handling of that with interest. I personally would have preferred an amendment to the Bill which spelt out that that will happen. I think such a provision should be in the Bill. It is only fair and proper. The Government made a commitment to the Grains Council on this matter, and we will be watching to see whether it is put into effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While welcoming the Government's guarantee of 85 per cent estimated net return in terms of the guaranteed minimum price, the position of the Liberal and National parties is significantly better for wheat growers in that we will be underwriting the harvest to 95 per cent of the estimated price as at 1 October. I cannot understand why the Government has put the guarantee at 85 per cent. It is not logical; it is not fair. I think it highlights very much the Government's lack of understanding of how the wheat industry operates, not only in this country but also internationally. That was highlighted by what happened with EEP and the position of the United States in relation to both Pakistan and India under this program. I believe the right moves at the right time could have prevented that. Unfortunately, those moves were not made. I do not have the time to go into that today, but no doubt it will come up for debate in time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wheat industry is a very valuable one to Australia in terms of its exports earnings. It was demonstrated quite clearly yesterday how we need those earnings with the blow-out in the national account figures and, of course, the current account deficit figure of $1.8 billion given the day before. What can be done to improve the wheat growers' position from a national point of view&mdash;I am not talking about individual wheat growers now&mdash;and to increase those earnings, because the potential is there to produce more grain, is to get the costs of the industry down. Our policies are about doing that. They are about getting down the costs of doing business in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must learn from what has happened in other nations where they have reduced the compounding impacts of indirect taxes which flow through into the cost of production. As Senator Brownhill before me mentioned, we will be moving to remove wholesale sales tax, fuel excise and payroll tax. I will give honourable members just one example of this, although it may have little to do with wheat. Last week I was at Green and Sons, an abattoir at Harvey in Western Australia. It is a very efficient abattoir, about two-thirds of the size of the Wodonga meat works. That abattoir pays $680,000 in payroll tax a year. That is an impost which is put back directly on the industry. In this particular case, the manager of Green and Sons said it would be worth about 6c a kilo in terms of the beef that goes through there to the producer. It is an enormous amount in terms of net dollars back per beast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same situation applies in the wheat industry. The way that we can continue to compete against the subsidies which exist in the United States and Europe is to keep our costs to a minimum. Currently they are not. A recent raft of sales tax Bills that went through this Parliament once again added to the costs of doing business and growing wheat, as they added to the costs of a whole host of industries. Lowering costs must be the direction this country takes if it is going to address its current account problems and its debt problems because we must be able to out-compete those we are competing with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of value adding&mdash;and this is part of what is involved with this wheat industry fund&mdash;the people who are administering this must look not only at the first round effects but also at the second and third round effects with respect to those countries with which we are doing business. Often, when one goes beyond what appears to be a glossy, pretty picture on the front cover, one finds there are disadvantages down the track if one goes past a certain point. I make an appeal to those people, when they are looking at the commercial operations, to analyse them very carefully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important that the single desk status for export markets remain. It is important that the wheat industry fund be developed with the principal aim and target of funding the GMP, or guaranteed minimum payments. That fund should not be seen as some little nest egg where people can play their own little games with value adding and not look at the total commercial operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian wheat growers and those people who are employed in the wheat industry, right through to the wharf, will be significantly better off under the coalition policy of getting rid of input taxes than they are under the Government. It is important to recognise that, in changing the whole structure of indirect taxation, under our policy the tax on all business inputs that are taxed through a goods and services tax formula will be fully rebated back to the individual producers, and there will be a positive cash flow benefit for the transport industry and the cooperative bulk handling systems that we have in this country. I emphasise that point. While I support this Bill, I also believe that the Government could have done a lot better. Certainly the wheat industry, its associated industries and the employees in those industries will be significantly better off under the policies of a Liberal-National Party coalition government. </PARA>

I am perfectly happy to acknowledge that the Government is not attempting to claim any credit for these amendments going through the Parliament, except to say that they are a product of the fact that we actually do listen to what the industry has to say about these matters and are very much working with industry to ensure the further progression of this legislation in allaying the concerns that Senator Panizza and others have raised this morning.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right; we will debate that another day. In order to provide the wheat industry with an adequate asset base for both making advance payments and participating in grains based value adding activities, the amendments contained in this Bill will extend the wheat industry fund until 1999.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to recognise that the wheat industry fund and the associated compulsory levy on wheat sales were instigated in 1989 by the industry through the Grains Council of Australia and that the fund's management by the Australian Wheat Board is subject to a business plan which has to be approved by the GCA. The proposed extension has the support of the Grains Council of Australia and the majority of its affiliated State grower organisations. For some time the GCA has recognised that there is a need to make provision for repayment of wheat industry fund equity in cases of death or retirement from the wheat industry and in financially necessitous circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government concurs with the Grains Council of Australia on this issue and is currently acting on its request for an amendment to the WIF regulations which would allow for repayment of equity in the case of death or a declaration of personal bankruptcy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wider case for repayment of equity to growers who have permanently exited the industry, who object to the wheat industry fund on principle or who do not belong to a Grains Council of Australia affiliate organisation and therefore feel they have no control over their WIF investment, is currently being considered by the Grains Council of Australia, largely in the context of developing an active market for the trading of WIF certificates which may or may not require changes to the regulations. The Government would encourage the industry to actively pursue options to meet these needs. The Government will amend the regulations governing the use and management of the wheat industry fund only after receiving a report or a request to do so from the industry itself. </PARA>

On behalf of the industry, I thank the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) and the GCA for the assurance that they will look at the issues of death and bankruptcy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to further debate the matter of exiting the industry. My draft amendment included a situation in which a person ceased to be a wheat grower by selling or disposing of the property on which the relevant wheat is grown and by surrendering a grain information acknowledgment number or property number. I know that the Grains Council, in conjunction with the Minister, is looking at the matter on this basis. I do not believe it is difficult to put the right terms into legislation so that it is possible to pay out people exiting the industry completely. The rural adjustment scheme has found a way around it, and I think the Grains Council and the Minister should look at it. It is a quite simple way: growers exiting the industry sign a statutory declaration that if they want to come back into the industry, they have to pay that money back in again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue the GCA is looking at is the growers' objection in principle to putting money into the wheat industry fund. I do not place great importance on that because I believe that the industry, while it is holding sole export powers via the Wheat Board, should be paying some sort of levy to do such things as underwrite borrowings. I do not have too much sympathy in that case, but I certainly have sympathy for the people who need their money because of death, bankruptcy or financial need, and for those leaving the industry. When people who have superannuation leave their workplace they are entitled to take it with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister spoke about creating a market for the certificate in the wheat industry levy. But that would not work. For example, there is a market for a Cooperative Bulk Ltd certificate in Western Australia, but with a very big discount it would make it not worth while. I thank the Minister for the assurances that he gave us on those points that we, especially those of us from Western Australia,  raised. I would like to see him and the Grains Council work harder on helping those exiting the industry. I think there is no need for me to move my committee stage amendment. </PARA>

For those who do not know, if we have some concern about a Bill, rather than spending an inordinate amount of time on it in the chamber, the Bill is referred to the relevant standing committee and examined there.

<PARA>These amendments have been circulated to the Committee. I table a supplementary explanatory memorandum on behalf of the Government relating to these amendments. It might be useful to the Committee if I now outlined their structure and purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government wishes to propose these amendments in order to ease the impact on hostels of the changes to personal care subsidies which are contained in the Bill. The Government is proposing that the new rates of recurrent subsidy for hostel residents will apply only to new residents admitted from 28 April 1993 onwards. We believe that this will give hostels more time to adjust to the impact of the measures contained in the Bill. As it stands, it introduces a distinction, as honourable senators will know, between financially disadvantaged and non-financially disadvantaged residents who are receiving personal care subsidies. This distinction will allow the Government to provide higher personal care subsidies of 55c a day for all financially disadvantaged residents. At the same time, subsidies for non-financially disadvantaged residents receiving personal care subsidies are to be reduced by $2.65 a day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basis of the Government's decision to vary the rate of subsidy according to the financial status of the residents was to make the range of income available to all hostels more equitable. Quite clearly, those hostels which take on high levels of financially disadvantaged residents will gain additional income from the decision. Obviously, those hostels which will experience a reduction in subsidies are those with a relatively greater capacity to raise income from their residents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators will know that, when we went into the Committee, it was the Government's intention to implement these changes in full in January next year. However, the Government has had discussions in recent weeks with industry and the consumer representatives, in which it has become apparent that many hostels would like more time to prepare for the impact of this initiative. The amendments I am proposing are a direct response to these concerns. Hostel operators have indicated that they need time to adjust their budgets to accommodate changes in subsidies and that it would therefore be preferable for the initiative to apply to new residents only. The aged care industry has also claimed that some residents have entered into agreements with hostel operators in which their fees are not easily adjustable in the short term. We believe that the phasing in of this initiative will allow old agreements to be renegotiated where necessary and agreements for new residents to be drawn up which contain appropriate fees and methods of adjusting those fees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Existing residents will be defined as those who are residing permanently in a hostel between 6 January and 27 April 1993. This will ensure that the objectives are reached and should give hostel operators sufficient time to adjust to the new payment system, which will affect individual hostels in line with their resident turnover rates and the financial profiles of their new residents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this particular series of amendments does illustrate the Government's preparedness to respond constructively to the concerns of the aged care industry and consumer representatives, where residents' rights and continuity of care services are at issue. Finally, I would like to remind honourable senators that government expenditure on care subsidies for hostels has increased from an average per capita subsidy of $1,500 in 1985-86 to an average per capita annual subsidy of $4,600 in 1991-92. In fact, overall expenditure on hostels is expected to increase from $234m in 1991-92 to over $316m committed in 1992-93. I trust these amendments will receive the support of the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A sense of urgency, a sense of the Government and its department knowing best, and in many cases a wish for secrecy, seemed to lead to the undoing of the Government on these important Bills. Thank goodness we do have a Senate system of committees. The Government slams legislation through the lower House with the guillotine, and also tries it in this House, but at least there is a mechanism whereby the people of Australia can be protected by the Senate standing committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the Bill in question. The Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2), as originally proposed, was to provide for a reduction of $2.65 a day in the personal care subsidies going to non-financially disadvantaged persons in hostels. The Bill is a cost cutting measure by the Government. There is no other justification for it. There is no other explanation offered. Clearly, that is what it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that if the Bill had gone ahead, it would disadvantage the existing residents if the proprietors raised their fees. Alternatively, it would ultimately disadvantage the hostel proprietors if they did not raise the fees. Another alternative, I suppose, is that it would result in a reduction in the quality of care available to those residents. On any reading of the Bill, the results would be most unfortunate for all concerned. In addition, with the introduction of the changes to the hostel subsidy arrangements, instead of the current four levels of subsidy, there will be seven, and this will result in even more complex administrative and budgeting clerical activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anybody who has visited a few hostels or nursing homes would have to understand that the members of staff in hostels and nursing homes are up to their ears in paperwork already. They are saying to me that they do not have enough time to talk to residents. The tender loving care is being jeopardised, all through this need to satisfy the bureaucratic requirements of this Government. I think that this legislation really was the final straw for Aged Care Australia, which is the peak body representing the voluntary sector hostels and nursing homes. I draw to the attention of the Senate the fact that in September that body placed an advertisement in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> which stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Aged Care Australia no longer has confidence in the Commonwealth Government's implementation of the Aged Care Reform Strategy.</PARA>
<PARA>It took a lot for the organisation to have its members agree to support such an advertisement. I think that the fact that Aged Care Australia felt strongly enough to protest in public in that way is a pretty gross indictment of the Government's policies over the last 10 years which have led us to this pretty pass. One has to ask: just what sort of confidence can older Australians have in this Government's long term care policies when one of the largest aged care organisations in Australia has no confidence in this Labor Government? These are the people at the coalface providing the services and care for older Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this coming election, no doubt, the Government will rush around trying to sell itself to older Australians, trying to convince them that it is deep and meaningful and caring and compassionate and that the coalition alternative would be so unfeeling and uncaring that older Australians should not even consider voting for the coalition. I say to those older Australians who are listening: talk to your local nursing home or hostel staff and find out how caring and compassionate this Government is when it comes to actually providing care and helping to finance care for older Australians now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The system is being slowly strangled. The people who work to care for elderly Australians are being terribly disheartened. They are worried about the future and the care that they will be able to give in the future. The Government has backed down on part of its legislation, and rightly so. Therefore, the Opposition will support the Government's amendments. It is a pity, though, that it had to take pressure from the various industry organisations such as  Aged Care Australia, that I mentioned, from Australian Nursing Homes and Extended Care Association, and from the National Asso-ciation of Nursing Homes and Private Hospitals. That is not to forget the Opposition, which has made quite clear its concern in the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very sad that it had to take all that pressure for the Government to see reason. If the Government were consulting properly, if it really did understand the needs of the aged care industry, it would not have considered putting this legislation through in the form in which it has. If ever honourable senators needed a demonstration of how out of touch the Government is with the problems facing people working at the grassroots, this legislation demonstrates it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new amendments propose two changes: firstly, that the revised subsidies will not come into effect until 28 April 1993 and, secondly, that the changes will not apply to existing residents. Existing residents are defined as those who have lived in the hostel for at least one day between 6 January 1993 and 27 April 1993 inclusive. The Opposition thinks that this is a reasonable compromise and, therefore, the Opposition will support the Government's amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the House of Representatives, Dr Woods, who took this legislation through as the shadow Minister, expressed some concern about a clause which relates to an issue regarding specialists. Patient referrals from GPs to consultant physicians or specialists are kept by the consultant or physician for 18 months and can be requested by the Health Insurance Commission to be produced. Page 4, clause 10 of the legislation indicates that that time should be seven days. Dr Woods indicated that that was a very short period of time, given that a secretary may be away sick or a doctor may be away on a conference. The doctor can suffer a penalty of $500 if, as the clause actually says, the doctor fails to comply without a reasonable excuse.</PARA></TALK.START>

Dr Woods moved an amendment in the House of Representatives that the time during which the doctor was able to provide the referral information be changed to 30 days. The Government obviously was not prepared to support that. We had discussions with the Democrats outside, and they were not prepared to support that 30-day provision.

It is the doctor's word against that of the Health Insurance Commission as to whether the doctor actually posted it, or the doctor has to send it by registered or certified mail to get indication of the date. I think that is absolute nonsense. It would seem to me very reasonable if we could reach a compromise here and have 14 days, which is often the time that is required to respond to Telecom or other statutory authorities, if one is asked to provide information. I call on honourable senators to consider this proposal and see whether we can come to an arrangement which means that we would have less doctors' time spent on bureaucratic nonsense and less taxpayers' money spent on bureaucrats chasing up people who do not get a response back.

<PARA>The Opposition is not prepared to support the proposition in clause 22 of the Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992, which proposes to amend the classification and review provisions for nursing home residents. It provides for the retrospective classification of these residents to the date of the original classification. This amendment will remove the retrospectivity element. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently, when a resident is classified according to the resident classification instrument and the validation of this assessment means a change in classification, the changes take place from the date of validation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a classification is revoked and substituted by a classification that requires a lower funding level, the nursing home proprietor would be required to repay to the Commonwealth the difference in funding between the reclassified level and the level of the original classification. Refunds would be required even though the nursing home proprietor has already spent the money on personal care for the resident. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The harshness of this system is that somebody receives care, staff are paid wages to give that care, and then at a later date&mdash;a date of his or her own convenience&mdash;somebody from the Department comes along, looks at the documents, usually does not bother to look at the resident and says, `This resident has been wrongly classified'. The result is that the Department wants the money back that has already been paid to the staff to give care to that resident. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe, and the Opposition certainly believes, that it becomes grossly unfair when the proprietor has to hand that money back.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The directors of nursing and the nursing staff assess residents based on their needs and, based on that assessment, they make a professional decision as to what care is required.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The professional standards are adversely affected by the validation process and the original decision by the nursing staff&mdash;using a departmental assessment tool&mdash;as to a patient's care requirements is being challenged primarily on the basis of the inadequacy of documentation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Department does not believe that, I urge it, as a learning exercise, to start visiting the nursing homes around this country as I have been doing for the last three months. In the Senate inquiry it was very clear from the answers we got from witnesses that senior officers in this Department are not doing that. How can they possibly expect to be making important decisions and giving important advice to government if they really do not know what is actually happening and the realities at grassroots level?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now, with the introduction of this stupid system, which is heavily dependent upon paperwork and which is tying up professional staff who should be providing professional care, we are requiring them to answer the needs of this Department. The level of the documentation that is required in order to meet the Government's standards is not only time consuming but also, as I said earlier, it reduces the time available for other forms of care. Once again, there was minimal consultation on these changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the second session of the legislation committee the issue was addressed by correspondence from the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition does not believe that that suggestion from the Minister is good enough. We believe that the Department has to lift its game and carry out assessments promptly.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not have any brief to protect an incompetent director of nursing. I certainly am not here to support anybody who is trying to defraud the taxpayer in some way. The Department has to do its job effectively. It has to be efficient and speedy. Another area of this Department is right now going back and validating expenditure which was made in 1986-87 and clawing back hundreds of thousands of dollars from nursing home proprietors. That is a measure of my concern as to why the Department should be allowed to come in at any time and claw back money that may have been paid many months ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delays in validation are unjust and our amendment is intended to ensure that the Department has financial pressure on its shoulders to make sure that the delays in validation do not occur. By removing the retrospective element, the Department can change the funding received by the nursing home only from the date the validation occurs. That is a prospective effect on funding and that is the way it should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I conclude I want to say a few words about this documentation. The entire complexity of the system as it currently operates is absolutely appalling, in my view. An assessment is required of each resident in each nursing home in Australia. Then there are the reassessments of the residents if their condition changes, which of course happens to older people. They can improve in their condition but more usually their condition declines. They must be reassessed because of the requirements of this funding system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Incredible documentation is required on the care actually being provided. The Department says that the industry is overdocumenting for its requirements. The industry says that if its documentation is not as substantial as it is making it, the Department refuses to be convinced that the care has been provided and therefore the funding is reduced. People who run a business&mdash;which a nursing home is, no matter who is the proprietor&mdash;know that they cannot afford to allow their funding to decrease if they are providing a service on which that funding is based. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department's attitude rather reminds me of the attitude of some of the factory managers that I met in the Soviet Union, who did not understand very much about the difference between revenue and profit and how a business can survive. Maybe the Department should have a bit better understanding of business principles and then perhaps it would be more understanding of people who are trying to operate a business of providing care for the aged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The departmental directives may not, in fact, demand this massive paperwork, but the effective requirement is demonstrated in the assessments which get knocked back in the validation process for want of documentation. This is a complex, onerous and bureaucratic process which is compounded by delays in the validation process and then the clawing back of funds from organisations which have paid that money to their staff for care already given to residents. Only a government and a bureaucracy which have little understanding of or concern for the needs of the industry and for the way it actually operates could devise such an Alice in Wonderland system. The proposals on which the system was originally based do not seem unreasonable, but the implementation and the execution of the system are sheer madness. A simpler, fairer, more certain funding system is urgently needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition will be very interested to receive Professor Gregory's report into the funding of nursing homes. We can only hope that he will be prepared to do more than tinker around the edges. It is a pity that he was not given terms of reference which allowed him to consider hostels funding in conjunction with nursing home funding. Once again, one wonders at the Government's intention when that task was not given to him. I hope I have made very clear our concerns about the current arrangements and the way they are being implemented. We certainly cannot support the retrospectivity element. That is why the Opposition is moving to have that retrospective element removed from the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I said in the second reading debate and again in the hearings of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs on these clauses, the Government's proposal to allow for retrospective classification of nursing home residents was never acceptable to the Australian Democrats. In the Committee hearings, there was a suggestion from the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) that there was an undertaking by the Government that there would be nothing more than three months in terms of reclassification; in other words, if it took longer to reclassify then the money would not have to be paid back.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, after considerable debate and discussion on this issue we will now be supporting the Opposition's amendments. In fact, these amendments are very similar to the ones that we foreshadowed in the Committee. We do not believe there is any compromise on this issue, once we look at the fact that the other measures such as suspending the self-assessment have not really been tried and that, as we heard in the Committee, it is often a paperwork problem that causes the reclassification in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, we will support the removal of any retrospectivity element. We hope that, if there are still some problems with nursing homes which are regularly placing an inaccurate classification on their residents, there will be continued education and support and that the Department will use some of the powers that it already has only as a last resort. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are most concerned that the best possible care and attention are made available to those hostel residents and those in nursing homes throughout Australia where the Commonwealth Government does have a funding role. By a funding role, I mean that we make decisions which allow other members of the Australian community, through their contribution to the taxation system and in other ways, to provide the sorts of subsidies and amounts of money which do ensure the high degree of proper care and attention that those residents properly deserve.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, that puts a tremendous responsibility on government to ensure that, for example, where different amounts of money can be paid to a nursing home, depending on the classification of a resident, the classification being undertaken by the management of the nursing home is as accurate as is humanly possible, given the vagaries and the difficulty in borderline cases of how a perhaps frail, elderly person is to be adjudged in regard to the various classifications. But there is a very real responsibility on government. It is in relation to that that the proposal is put forward in this Bill which deals with the effect of the review of classifications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Newman has spoken of the role of departmental officers in this whole area in a way which I think is, at times, simply in the mode of literary allusion such as Alice in Wonderland, which perhaps is not too hard for officers to bear. It was unfortunate that Senator Newman drew an analogy with managers of factories in the Soviet Union. Although she will say that she was confining her analogy to particular instances of the understanding of revenue and profits and the like, it was a most unfortunate analogy. I certainly wish to indicate that I do not believe that there is any parallel or comparison at all between those caricatured and stereotyped persons, if you like, who are managing affairs in the Soviet Union and those whom I know to be very sympathetic and professional officers of the Department trying to manage a major area of expenditure in order to ensure that, in the end, residents receive the care and attention which is their just due. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators have mentioned the appearances before the Standing Committee on Community Affairs. I think it was a very useful exercise. As a result, evidence was given that there could be a severe financial impact on some nursing homes if residents classified many months earlier were down classified. I can understand that there could be an impact, but how severe would depend ultimately on the misclassification those many months before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, a very sympathetic and practical response by the Minister emerged during the Senate Committee hearing. A very real willingness was indicated to alleviate the impact on the nursing homes concerned and, importantly, to maintain the responsibility of the Government to ensure that proper expenditure of money is provided by taxpayers for these purposes. Honourable senators will recall that I offered to the Committee that the Minister issue a directive to ensure basically that reviews be restricted to residents classified within the previous three months. It was thought that that would provide an incentive to the departmental officials to get out and do the validations within three months of the initial classification. So there would be an incentive there. It would also reduce the adverse financial impact on nursing homes by the retrospectivity being restricted to that three-month period from the reclassification backwards, if I can tautologise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That particular offer of a directive was sympathetic, but practical. It would have served to allay the more extreme fears that were expressed on behalf of nursing homes in relation to financial impact. We are now left with a situation where the Opposition and the Democrats have agreed to completely omit this retrospective element and make the reclassification purely prospective, quite apart from the fact that an upgrading can also occur. Presumably, it is the intention of the Democrats and the Opposition that that have only a prospective effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that Senator Newman and Senator Lees have both mentioned what we might call reserve powers in the Department, which I do not think have been invoked very often. If a home is somewhat recalcitrant and persistent in its misclassification, its entitlement to carry out the classifications might be suspended and the departmental officers will undertake the assessment from the earlier stage. Perhaps that suggestion should be taken up by the Department in those particular instances and that section dusted off at the invitation of the Opposition and the Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite clearly, the matter will now have to go back to the Minister for his consideration as to what to do if this clause is omitted. It will have some impact on the expenditure expectations of the Government. This will have to be assessed and decisions made in the light of what happens in the chamber today. To reiterate, what was put forward was a sympathetic and practical response to the problem identified in the Senate Committee hearing. I still maintain that it is a response which is worth the support of this chamber, and for that reason the Government opposes the amendment moved by Senator Newman. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bills appropriate $7,000m of Australian taxpayers' money for schools and higher education. Yesterday we dealt with the Bills relating to funding for technical and further education. We have before us $7,000m to provide for education. My case, on behalf of the Opposition, is that that $7,000m for education is not being and has not been used wisely by the Labor Government. Opportunities have been missed for the last five, even 10, years of the Labor Government. We need a refreshing change in Australia. The election of a Liberal and National government will give more resources to schools, refresh our policies and ensure that we will gain excellence from both schools and higher education institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Madam Acting Deputy President, you may smile; Government members may smile at their complacency about education in this country. The Liberal and National parties continue to criticise the inadequacies and failures of the Labor Government. We have sharply criticised the Government's predilection for centralism and bureaucratic intervention. These are the two diseases of the Labor Government. It thinks that all wisdom is in Canberra and that everything must be monitored and agreed to by some public servants and the Ministers here in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that we have had a period of regulation, that a framework has been put in place for education decisions in this country, and that we now need to give initiative back to Australian students and institutions, both schools and higher education institutions. This will be the theme of an incoming Liberal and National Party government next year. We believe that we need greater choice. We also believe that there should be greater incentive, greater local initiative and autonomy and, in all, a much better outcome of excellence in education standards. Our policies, as presented in the Fightback package, to which I will refer briefly in this debate, will turn education right around in this country and get the kinds of good outcomes for which the Australian public is looking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 2) changes the shape of funding arrangements by providing Federal Government funding directly to institutions and not, as I have been debating for the last 15 years in the Senate, through the States to those institutions. This is a worthwhile change which is entirely consistent with Opposition policy. There is another very regrettable attempt by the Labor Government to entrench compulsory student unionism; it is a deplorable step which the Opposition will strongly oppose. We will vigorously seek to delete clause 66 at the committee stage of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The underlying problem with the new funding, however, is that it does nothing to change the basic framework of higher education under Labor; it is a framework of intrusive Federal regulation, assaults on the autonomy of institutions, the imposition of bureaucratic requirements for education profiles and forced amalgamations without educational justification, and the list goes on. The Government remains committed to that approach. There is not one change in general direction after these 10 years of failure. As I say, the only way ahead for Australia in education matters is to change the Government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. One of the main changes proposed by this Bill is to provide for Federal funds for higher education to be paid directly to institutions, rather than to the States which, in the past, have been required to pass them on to institutions. This reflects the reality of the prime role of the Federal Government, acquired over the last two decades, for the provision of public funds to higher education. The Opposition does not oppose this significant step. But I observe that it will much more easily enable the implementation of our policies on coming to government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal and National parties will focus on empowering individual students and individual education institutions. We will put aside the current intervening powers of governments and of the central bureaucracy. This direct link of funding to institutions and our further approach of direct funding linked to individual students and their choices will be the way ahead in the coming years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also note the insertion by clause 61 of some `objects' for the higher education system. This will provide a measure by which we can judge the Government's policies. So far it would appear that, even by the measures now set out in statutory form, the Government has failed. However, we support the inclusion of such worthy objects in this statutory form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another change is that, from 1994, we will see capital grants incorporated into institutions' recurrent or general operating funds. This is very welcome. I have called for this  for several years and I thank the Government for implementing our policy. In another direct steal from Fightback the Government has shifted the discount given for up-front payments for HECS, the higher education contribution scheme, from 15 per cent to 25 per cent, which is the figure that the Liberal and National parties announced in the Fightback policy. Again, we thank the Government for implementing our policy on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation also makes provision for 200 more postgraduate research awards. That is exactly the number that we announced in the Fightback package a year ago. I thank the Government for recognising the strength of the Fightback package yet again. I could go on and on, but time forbids my mentioning those positive elements of this legislation which have in fact been borrowed directly&mdash;exactly&mdash;from the Liberal and National parties' Fightback policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we will increase the value of postgraduate awards by a further $2,000 a year. The Government just does not have the resources to do that. We will. We will not only increase resources in the area of postgraduate awards, we will give greater resources to all areas of education&mdash;schools, higher education, TAFE. Education is the big winner in Fightback because of the provisions for additional resources and a completely refreshing approach to the policy directions in these three areas of education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also embodies the Government's open learning initiative. However, from what Ministers have said, it seems that the Government does not really understand exactly what it is about and what its role can usefully be. It is very vague indeed. This open learning initiative will help to provide opportunities of access for some who have not so far had the opportunity for university education. However, it is still no answer to the massive problem of unmet demand for higher education places. In the Budget Speech, the Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, described it as making a university degree available to everybody with a television set and a letterbox. What a facile description of an aspiration held by so many Australians. It is not as easy as that. A great deal more thought needs to be put in to ensure that this open learning initiative will succeed. Indeed, it is no answer to the unmet demand of so many Australians. This year 50,000 students were turned away from our universities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill repeals chapter 5 of the Act, which was the product of a particularly nasty action by Mr Dawkins when he was the Minister. To save the Senate's time, I seek leave to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> the last two pages of my speech on this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the original Higher Education Funding Bill was put before the Parliament in 1988, it included some increases in funding and also the introduction of the HECS scheme. Mr Dawkins made it clear that the higher level of funding was conditional on the HECS scheme being passed. This chapter 5 provided for a lower level of funding if HECS was not passed. It was a clear case of political blackmail, quite disgraceful. In the event the circumstance which the Chapter was designed for did not occur, and so the Chapter was never proclaimed. It is right that we are now removing it from the statute book, but it recalls for us a very shabby bit of behaviour by this Labor Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final aspect of this Bill which I will refer to is clause 66, which entrenches the obnoxious practice of compulsory student unionism. The Opposition vehemently opposes this clause. It is wrong in principle and inequitable in practice. The Government has tried to get this disgraceful proposal through the Senate before, in 1990, and the Bill at that time on my motion as spokesman in the Senate on education matters was defeated at the third reading. That was the right outcome then, and it ought to be the outcome this time. May I urge the Democrats (who may be tempted to support this clause this time) to be fair-minded on this matter, to uphold freedom to choose for all Australians, and not to give it away to vested interests. If they vote for this clause the Democrats will again place themselves as nothing more than another faction of the Labor Party. While I shall have more to say on this when we are in Committee, I say now that this clause is disgraceful. The Minister makes the ludicrous claim that the Bill `includes protection for the rights and responsibilities of higher education institutions to make their own decisions, independent of Government interference, on the provision of services and amenities for their students'. It is in fact the reverse of this. Moreover, for this Government to pretend it is concerned about `institutional autonomy' is simply ludicrous. Its whole record is one of interference with institutions, not the reverse. The Government is here seeking to punish and penalise those States which choose to provide for freedom of choice for students. This is a matter of basic principle. I remind the Senate of the right to freedom of association. This Bill tramples all over that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is offensive for a student to be compelled to belong to a body which may take up political and other causes that the student considers strongly objectionable and to which the student has no wish to contribute financial support. The Government is here legislating against freedom of choice but we should be doing the opposite. We should be legislating to enhance and entrench freedom of choice.

<PARA>This legislation does nothing substantial to lift the burden of the repressive new schools policy. The Bill makes some minor changes. They are welcome; they are borrowed from us.

The Government's ideological hostility to private provision in education remains, even though this is a choice which a significant number of parents increasingly wish to exercise. Thirty per cent of Australia's school children attend non-government schools but at least 50 per cent aspire to.

Giving these increased resources to independent schools is not at the taxpayer's expense because in fact they represent a saving to the taxpayer.

I certainly look forward to a vigorous debate in committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This package of education Bills before the Senate today covers a wide range of areas. It is unfortunate indeed that a discussion as wide ranging as to involve secondary schooling, university funding, Aboriginal education and overseas students charges, should be a cognate debate. I wish to address briefly each of these Bills and speak on the issue of universal membership of student organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill provides the funding for primary and secondary schools for the next four years, totalling some $2.8 billion. This includes funding for projects under the national equity program, the implementation of the revised new schools policy, and the introduction of new broad banding arrangements for schools equity programs in 1994. This will affect the assistance for ESL training, literacy and learning, special education, education in disadvantaged schools and country areas, and disabled students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The States Grants (Schools Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2) provides for the supplementation of funds appropriated for schools programs for 1992 and extends eligibility for English as a second language to dependants of certain categories of temporary entry permit holders. The Overseas Students Charge Amendment Bill 1992 adjusts the higher education charges for overseas students to the maximum level of 55 per cent of the full cost of an average higher education place. This is expected to raise $10.3m in 1992-93. The Australian Democrats will not be opposing this legislation; however, during Question Time we will be looking closely at the second reading attachments circulated by Senator Teague. I have not had an opportunity to examine those in detail at this stage and I will be considering our support for them over lunch. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, on the question of overseas students charges, I warn the Government against using overseas students studying in this country as `milking cows'&mdash;which was the term used by the National Liaison Committee representing overseas students in Australia, which complains of helping to finance higher education in this country and yet receiving minimal assistance in the form of orientation or bridging courses for overseas students. While overseas students are paying fees as high as $9,732 per annum for degrees such as dentistry, they are entitled to the highest education standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no secret that the declining quality of degrees and infrastructure on campuses is of tremendous concern not only to overseas students but also to local students who find declining quality of library collections and overcrowded lecture theatres the norm of the day. In my department of archaeology, ancient history and classics at the University of Sydney, our funding has been cut to such an extent that both second and third year tutorials are now non-existent, which represents a serious decline in the capacity of the faculty of arts to deliver a broad ranging and well-rounded degree in Middle Eastern archaeology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final Bill we are looking at today is the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill, which provides funding for the State and Territory governments' non-government school systems, Aboriginal education institutions and education consultative bodies for the 1993-95 triennium, totalling quite a great deal of money. This Bill represents a 13 per cent funding increase in this area, which is certainly very welcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the findings of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody in mind, this Bill seeks to redress the poor levels of education attainment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. This involves incorporating awareness about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and their history into the curriculum and the implementation of programs like the national Aboriginal languages and literacy strategy and the national reconciliation and schooling strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final Bill, the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No.2), provides funding for the purposes of higher education in the States and in the Northern Territory. It provides for direct payment of Commonwealth funding to higher education institutions and also reflects the decision to incorporate capital funding into operating grants. It commits a total of $4.7 billion in funding for higher education in 1995, the third year of the new funding triennium. This amount includes $23.6m for additional student intakes, $274m for capital works and a further $252m for research programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill also provides the funding for the open learning initiative in 1993. I maintain that there are some outstanding questions about the quality of the open learning project and about its inequitable fee structure. Senator Teague pointed to the statement made by the Minister regarding access to open learning. The question we asked about the open learning program was: where are the quality control mechanisms?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is simply not sufficient to say that every person with a television and a letterbox can have access to a university degree. Some quality control mechanisms must be in place and an equitable fee structure must be established to ensure that the very disadvantaged groups that the Government is attempting to reach are able to access the open learning program. OLI certainly does have the potential to widen access to higher education for traditionally disadvantaged groups but, with the financial disincentive of up-front fees, many of these groups could well be locked out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We understand that the Government is looking at some kind of deferred payment mechanism for open learning such as the HECS mechanism, and we would certainly support that. However, the decision to establish some kind of deferred payment process was done only after pressure from the Democrats and from a range of student and academic groups who had voiced their concern. Open learning must not be considered as a solution to unmet demand and it is not a quick fix or stopgap measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision in the Budget, reflected in this Bill, to increase the discount for up-front payment of HECS from 15 to 25 per cent per annum rewards those from higher socioeconomic backgrounds. I see no comparable discount being offered to those students in financial straits, only punitive schemes like the recently introduced student loan scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The discount and loans seem to be ideas pinched by the Government from the coalition's Fightback education policy. Increasingly, the Government's attitude towards education reflects that of the Opposition. Both parties seek to implement a user pays education system that will see a return to elite education for the rich. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increase in postgraduate research awards is a welcome move designed to boost Australia's research pool from which public and private sector researchers will come as our future academics, who are now in short supply. Our concern is that HECS still applies to research degrees unless a student has an exemption, which really does penalise our brightest and best students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AVCC recommended that HECS be abolished for students undertaking research degrees. In fact, it sent me an amendment to move to the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 2). However, I received the amendment only some half an hour ago and I really have not had an opportunity to examine it in detail and prepare it for dissemination on the floor of the chamber today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the Government to please consider abolishing the HECS for research degrees at universities. I understand that it would have budgetary implications, but I ask the Government to please consider that as it is penalising our best and brightest students, on whom our economic competitiveness rests. In terms of developing ideas and innovations, it seems to be a very bad decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An important section of the HEFA Bill is the provision which seeks to safeguard the autonomy of higher education institutions in relation to student organisations. This provision allows the Commonwealth to make up any shortfall in the revenue experienced by an institution as a result of State interference in the collection of student organisation fees. The Democrats are committed to supporting this provision, which will protect the vital services that student organisations provide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This debate has not been without controversy in the past, and even today Liberals have guised their contempt for the supportive role that student organisations provide on campus in the language of individual rights and industrial relations terminology. The claim by the shadow Minister for education, Dr Kemp, that he would introduce voluntary student unionism within 100 days of being elected to office has dire consequences for students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberals seek only to emasculate the power base which students currently have. They seek to deprive students, who are amongst the most financially powerless members of our community, of vital support services such as counselling, welfare, subsidised food and photocopying, meeting rooms and grievance procedures. There is strong support for this legislation from a variety of groups, including student groups, from whom I have received many letters of support, the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, university administrations and other community groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Payment of a fee is an obligation of enrolment within a university, which generates automatic membership of the student organisation and its affiliate bodies. The term `student union' is a misnomer; more appropriate is the term `guild' or `organisation', as student unions&mdash;contrary to the Opposition's claim&mdash;are not akin to industrial trade unions. This is a fundamental distinction. Student organisations are not industrial trade unions. They are not involved in the setting of awards or wage rates or in the legal complexities of arbitration and conciliation. Student organisations do not exercise any legal control over their members. They offer support and encouragement for social, cultural and intellectual pursuits. Student organisations provide a range of services and facilities, including bookshops, legal services, sport and recreational facilities, health services, employment services and publications, and even personal injury insurance, as well as academic and educational representation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the services provided by student organisations could not be provided by universities, nor could many students afford them without the subsidies that student organisations offer. In the absence of student organisations, this responsibility would fall to the Government or the universities themselves, which in the current economic  climate would be unlikely to meet these funding needs. The fact that university administrations could not adequately cater for the quantity and quality of services such as those provided by the student guild is acknowledged by the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, which endorses universal membership and claims that student organisations are efficient and representative. The AVCC's view is that fees charged for student services are an obligation of enrolment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Student organisations are part of a university education which involves the fulfilment of both formal and informal modes of education. A university is a distinct social entity in which student organisations play an essential part. They are an important element in the social and cultural aspects of university existence and should not and cannot be considered separate from the whole education process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Universities can be compared validly with distinct communities and operate in a similar way to local councils, extending benefits to the student community through the provision of representation and services. Home ownership, by way of comparison, brings with it rights and obligations within the context of a municipal council. Payment of rates for the provision of services such as garbage collection, child-care and gardening is an obligation of becoming part of a local community. Some of these services are used and others are not. Rates also go towards payment for what are, to varying degrees, political activities of a council. </PARA>

Opposition senators come in here at Question Time and say that we should not debate the questions in answers. But those opposite put them right into the field. Is their argument that the abolition of payroll tax will create jobs? It just shows how relevant they are. That is a policy which would have created jobs before such things as automation and computerisation in industry. Sure, it would have created jobs in labour intensive industries in those days; it would have helped. It is a policy from the 1970s which they tend to apply in the 1990s. It is all about technology these days, fellows. You had better wake up to yourselves. It is not just about huge factories employing people.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will tell honourable senators what the Government will not do. Nurses in Melbourne are apparently today demonstrating and marching on the Victorian Parliament. The response by the Victorian Minister for Health, Marie Tehan, according to radio, is that she has promised that she will sack 3,500 health workers. This Government will not conduct industrial relations on that basis. As I have said, we do not take any joy from the ongoing industrial unrest in Victoria. It does not have a positive economic impact.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The blame for this action has to be laid squarely at the door of Mr Jeff Kennett. I will refer honourable senators to the latest `Jeffism' concerning nurses. Last week in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> Mr Kennett commented about nurses. I believe that nurses are regarded in our community as workers who are specifically dedicated to their profession, who are self-sacrificing and who are not, in the scheme of things, regarded as overly highly paid. Of nurses, Mr Kennett said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it must give them a great deal of pleasure to walk away from hospitals, not hurting the Government with their actions, but making those who are sick suffer just that little bit more.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Kennett's comments would have us believe that nurses are, in fact, undermining the level of health care by taking protests. They are not. They have ensured that the needs of patients in hospitals who are in any state of criticality or health need are protected but, at the same time, they are taking industrial action. They are taking industrial action as a group of Australian workers who traditionally never ever do so. But Jeff Kennett has forced them on to the streets into protest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why has he done that? The Kennett Government has proposed to abolish penalty rates, which means that the weekly income of a nurse who is a shift worker is reduced by 25 per cent&mdash;a reduction in income of a quarter. No-one in our community&mdash;no-one in this chamber&mdash;can afford to have their income cut by a quarter unilaterally. In the case of nurses it has been cut by that amount without any recourse to fair arbitration, without any independent inquiry and without any right for nurses to state their position in a proper forum. It has just been done unilaterally. It is an example of Liberal Party's industrial relations policy in action. It is what John Howard and Dr Hewson would do if they were in power. It brings Australia back to disputation and confrontation, something that we left behind in the days of Fraser. It is something that this Government will not do.

It is not likely to be an extraordinarily dramatic event in itself. But the point of the question is: why do we not offer high levels of protection to low cost, labour intensive industries in Australia when so many other countries offer them to theirs. We are in a geographically different position from European countries that do, in some cases, offer some higher levels of protection. Seven out of 10 of our major trading partners are in this area.

If so, how did the Minister become aware of this decision?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that the Victorian Government has announced the withdrawal of its funding support for the State day nurseries from 1 January next year. I am sure that would be a shock to many households and families throughout Victoria who do use those State day nurseries. I think since the mid-1940s the State Government of Victoria has provided operational funding for those nurseries. It now wishes to transfer the funding responsibility to the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Powell asked when we learnt about this. I think it was about 19 November, when a public meeting or some such thing was held and this became apparent, that we first became aware of it. The Commonwealth has been providing child-care fee relief to all private and State funded child-care services, including the State day nurseries, since 1 January 1991 and will continue to do so. But we are not going to accept this transfer of funding on the operational side, which the State Government obviously wishes to impose on the Commonwealth taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth will not assume responsibility of funding for services which have been a longstanding Victorian Government responsibility.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Powell also asked what negotiations are going on. I understand that Victoria has not accepted a Commonwealth offer to cost share the increased provision of non-profit, community based child-care in Victoria. I believe the majority of the other States and Territories have reached agreement on this. So, altogether, there seems to be an impasse and an attempt to shift funding responsibility to the Commonwealth. We are not going to accept that.</PARA>

I am sure it will be rejected by all those households and families, and I have no doubt that Senator Powell would share that sentiment.</PARA>

However, I do regard the fact that he has made some statements&mdash;which I do not have before me&mdash;which indicate a view as to the way in which the life insurance industry ought to reform itself or to be reformed as being somewhat pre-emptive in relation to the report which is to be published by the Trade Practices Commission within two or three weeks.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The campaign that is being waged at the moment&mdash;and I believe there was some sort of rally outside Parliament House earlier&mdash;is based on a completely distorted impression that has been given to those participating by certain leaders, principally within the New South Wales Teachers Federation. The fact is that the Government has increased its funding in the current financial year by $27m to a total of $143m for the teaching of English to those migrants and refugees who come here who obviously need to participate fully in the community, socially and culturally, and to engage in employment and ordinary commercial life and other transactions. There is a need for them to be fully equipped to participate in the Australian community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is prepared to make a contribution but we are saying that, whereas the average tuition time which was offered to past clients of the adult migrant English program was some 370 hours, they should have an entitlement of 510 hours of tuition.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are offering 510 hours of tuition.

As I say, $250 is the normal fee for residents for 510 hours of tuition. Migrants overseas wanting to come to Australia will pay varying fees. For example, a person in the concessional family category will pay $1,020 before getting a visa, while a person coming under the employment nomination scheme or the business skills program will pay $4,080.</PARA>

The Commonwealth Government reduces the total private sector debt figure. I do not know what those opposite think the total figure is.

They want to concentrate on that figure rather than the net foreign debt, which is the relevant figure. Senator O'Chee said the figure was $209 billion.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Parer this day relating to employment contracts.</PARA>
<PARA>During Question Time I asked Senator Cook to explain why he misled the Senate yesterday in response to a dorothy dixer question from Senator Faulkner. In answer to the question during Question Time yesterday, Senator Cook waved a document around saying, `I have a document that proves that the ink that is not yet dry on the Kennett industrial relations system is already working to the detriment of the people of Victoria'. Senator Cook is wrong. This document applies across-the-board to all the operations of Copperart in Australia. It is not something that is specific to Victoria. He then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this offer is based on a `take this contract or be sacked' style of negotiation.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Cook is wrong. He should have checked his facts before he deliberately misled this place. This contract is being offered on a voluntary basis. The employees of Copperart are being offered the choice of staying within the award system or taking the contract. Ninety-five per cent of them have taken the contract because they will get more money out of it. In his answer, the Minister then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The contract proposes a $12 hourly rate for 38 hours, with an abolition of rates for working late on Thursday and Friday nights. . .</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Cook is wrong. If he would like to check with Copperart, the 38 hours includes working Thursdays and Saturdays or Fridays and Saturdays. If he just wants to check the figures, the award rate in Victoria&mdash;which for this particular group of people is the highest of anywhere in Australia&mdash;for a 38-hour week, where people work three hours on a Thursday or Friday or seven hours on a Saturday, is $427.41. As I have said, that is much lower in other States because we know how silly the Victorians have been and the way in which they have brought their State into the basket case position. Under the contract being offered by Copperart it is $456, which represents a $30 increase&mdash;not the $47 or so that the Minister talked about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further in the Minister's answer he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a reduction of $41.86 per week. . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is in wages. I have shown quite clearly that it represents an increase. In respect of the answer to the supplementary question, another dorothy dixer, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They relate to loss of annual leave loading,. . . </PARA>
<PARA>and so on. Senator Cook is absolutely wrong. In fact, holiday pay is calculated on the basis of four weeks at $456 a week. The Minister went on in his answer to say that there will be a loss of the full level of superannuation entitlement. Senator Cook is wrong. In fact, the superannuation is calculated on 4 per cent of the $456, which is higher than the employees would have been paid if they had worked under the award. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this Minister has to come clean on this. It is all very well for him in hysteria to grab at something to support his own particular constituency&mdash;which is the ACTU and the Trades and Labour Council stuck down in Melbourne&mdash;but he is prepared to do anything to distort things. I do not mind him coming forward with a decent argument, but when he does not do his homework he deserves some criticism by this place. I ask: why did he table a document which was not limited to Victoria? Why did he not point out that the flat hourly rate included allowances for overtime? Why did he not state that the proposal was voluntary and that employees have the choice of accepting it or not?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is quite clear that what we have here is an attempt to defend by attacking&mdash;and by attacking me on grounds that are not true, that are erroneous and that do not hold up to proper inspection. The award that applies in the particular case of the classification of `employee' that I referred to yesterday is, as I recall&mdash;and I do not have the paper in front of me&mdash;the electrical and hardware retail award. Under the classification of `manager' in that award, which equates with the classification of the person to whom this document was presented, there is a weekly reduction in gross pay of an amount of about $41.80c-plus per week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The contract that was presented is a contract which purports to do a range of things. One of the things that it purports to do is to replace penalty rates for working on Thursday night for late-night shopping or on Fridays, or penalty rates of payment for working all day Saturday. As I recall, the document required the individual to present for work for 38 hours at any of those times as directed and receive a flat payment of $12 per hour. If we add that up and compare it with what they would receive, attracting penalty rates for working after the normal spread of working hours on Thursday night or Friday or all day Saturday, the reduction in the award, I repeat, is $41.80c-plus. They are the facts of the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me look now at what has been said. I am marked down as having misled because, according to the allegation, this was presented all over Australia and not just in Victoria. Logic dictates that it was therefore presented in Victoria. If it was presented elsewhere, what would be the legal standing of that document? That document's legal standing elsewhere would be that it would be illegal where it breached the standards of the award because it did not pay for the penalty rates for working on weekends and overtime and it therefore could not stand, unless people wished to collude to break the law. That is the first point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point is that in Victoria it was presented as a voluntary agreement. This is a retail store, part of a chain. I have seen the covering letter to the agreement, and if those opposite want me to present it for them to see the terms in which it was presented to the individual worker, I will produce that happily. The terms of the covering letter make it clear that there is an obligation, expected by the management, on the individual to agree to this document and to accept a cut in gross pay of $41.86 cents&mdash;</PARA>

The implication is well understood by ordinary people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing with this contract that I thought was totally unbelievable, until I saw it in writing, is that it lists a series of areas in which people can be instantly dismissed without having any benefits at all.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to make some comments on the answer that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) has given. This is one of the great battles which have now been joined by the two major parties as we go to the next election. One of the problems this Government has is that the enterprise based agreements typically give a major advantage to employees. Senator Cook and his colleagues set out day after day to misrepresent the nature of these particular agreements. In view of the fact that Senator Cook, in his comments, laid particular stress on the agreement being compulsory, I quote from a press release that Copperart issued:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All First Senior Shop Assistants in Copperart will be invited to join this totally non-compulsory scheme. If the employee does not elect to take up the contract, they are most welcome to remain on the current state award rate of remuneration.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very key point, I would have thought. The interesting figure that Senator Parer quoted was that 95 per cent of employees, given a choice between the new contract&mdash;which, as has been shown, considerably increases their wages and salaries&mdash;and remaining on the award, naturally chose to go on the new contract which was offered by the management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point that was made in relation to overtime is particularly interesting. The press release from Copperart also says&mdash;again, a point not put forward by Senator Cook:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On an average 56 trading hours per week in an Australian Shopping Centre, the Copperart employee can now, in consultation with his or her Manager in charge, adjust the shop roster to work as many of the 56 hours as they like&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, a 50-hour week will yield $600. In comparison with the award wages, the new contract offered by Copperart will give very substantial benefits to its employees. Naturally, free from the restraints of the award and the trade union bosses, the employees have chosen to strike an award with the management of Copperart which is to their benefit and to the benefit of Copperart. I put it to you, Mr President, that a senior Minister of this Government has come into this chamber and deliberately misled this chamber and the Australian people as to the nature of this Copperart award. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has become a major issue, because time and time again Senator Cook has come into this chamber and given totally misleading information. The contract, which has been signed by 95 per cent of Copperart employees, will give them a substantial benefit compared with the old trade union bosses' negotiated award. Senator Collins and the Labor Party really hate it when Australian workers and Australian management can get together and strike a decent deal to the advantage of both parties. The trade union bosses are cut out&mdash;and don't you people hate it!</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this issue, the Federal Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) is spot on and he is absolutely correct. He pointed out that the Copperart contract was offered to employees around Australia, including those in Victoria. It is a State award. It is clearly in breach of a number of awards in a number of States. It is certainly not in breach of the new regime in Victoria, it is certainly not in breach of the new changes in Tasmania, and it is probably not in breach of the new regime in New South Wales. But it is certainly in breach of the State award provisions in other States in the retail industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Parer claims that 95 per cent of the employees voluntarily accepted this contract. Senator Cook made quite a legitimate offer. Let us put this offer before an independent arbiter who will determine how many people are better off and by how much. Let us go one step further: rather than accept the word of the employer through a media release, the word of the so-called union bosses or anyone's word, let us ask the employees. I challenge the Opposition to call a few of these employers and employees before a Senate committee. Let us ask the employees how they felt when they signed these contracts. Let us be the judge of it in a forum in which they can make a statement free of any alleged coercion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we had a claim from Senator Campbell that employees are free to present themselves when they choose to go to work. Does anyone seriously believe that? The employer wants to know when employees will come to work. That employer wants a roster. The employee does not have any choice in that matter. The employee has to turn up when the employer wants him or her there. Frankly, if I were an employer, I would want the employee to turn up when I wanted him or her there. There is no freedom of choice in the hours that employees work. </PARA>

We would prefer to have and have striven to have agreements made between two parties which can be mutually beneficial. But what the Opposition has is a contract that was initiated by an employer and thrust upon the employees. Those opposite talk about certain public utterances that it is voluntary and that people can accept it or stay on the award&mdash;an award which the Opposition would like to destroy; awards in the Commonwealth area which it will destroy as quickly as it can; awards that will be destroyed in Australia by the current Victorian Government. The work force in Victoria is totally disenchanted about what is happening.

Prior to my request to him to give a reason for his delay in responding, he received a letter requesting his intervention.

<PARA>This is the most important political issue facing the nation at the moment. In this country we have a situation of policy paralysis against a background of mass unemployment. We have the worst unemployment record since the Great Depression&mdash;nearly one million Australians officially out of work and, according to most commentators, by the time one takes into account those who have given up seeking work and those who are underemployed, the figure is probably nearer double that. So there are nearly two million Australians either out of work or underemployed. That is the background against which the policy procedures of this Government have ground to a halt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What have we seen in the last two days? We have seen the most deplorable economic figures&mdash;economic figures that the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) and his colleagues have sought to talk down today. Last night the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) sought to talk them down. These figures indicate that the background economic situation is much worse than I think any of us ever imagined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have current account figures which indicate that, despite the parlous state of the economy, Australia is still absorbing imports at an enormous rate. The current account deficit is back up to the terrible figures of a few years ago&mdash;a $1.8 billion deficit is the latest figure&mdash;producing a trend line that has been rising for the last nine successive months. But that is discounted by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce and the Government as not being of any great consequence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The following day&mdash;yesterday&mdash;we received the deplorable foreign debt figures, which the Minister also seeks to talk down. They indicate that, in gross terms, Australia's foreign debt is now over $200 billion. Yes, that is government sector and private sector, but private sector debt in this country is created within the parameters of the economy as determined by the policies of this Government. It is a terrible figure. The Minister can say what he likes, but there can be no other interpretation than that it is terrible. The figure is tenfold what it was when this Government came into office. The Minister might not like it being expressed in these terms, but it means that every man, woman and child in this country is indebted to the extent of $11,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today the Minister again sought to discount that by arguing that instead of worrying about the extent of the debt we should just concern ourselves with the capacity to pay for it. But the Minister&mdash;and Senator O'Chee is well aware of this&mdash;did not address this vitally important point: a comparison of the trends between Australia and these Third World economies, which we do not like to refer to in these debates, indicates that their position is getting better and ours is getting worse. Mexico is an apt example. In 1985, debt as a percentage of GNP in Mexico was 55.2 per cent. By 1990, it had reduced to 42.1 per cent. In Australia in 1985 it was 23.7 per cent, and by 1990 it was up to 42 per cent. It is now even higher. The Minister may dismiss it, but the important fact&mdash;</PARA>

The growth rates tell us that, with an economy running at about 2 per cent growth, this Government will not even be able to maintain the employment rate at its current figure. What that sadly means, and what the Australian Bureau of Statistics has been telling us, is that the trend line for unemployment is still rising.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the record of this Government after 10 years in office, and that is the background to the debate. We and the Australian people must now address the alternatives that are open to us at the next election. At the moment, there is only one alternative. Only one side of politics in Australia&mdash;the coalition&mdash;is putting forward an alternative plan and vision that can result in growth and jobs in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government is offering nothing new, and that is deplorable. Every day this week we have come into this chamber and asked the Minister, in these critically important economic areas, particularly employment: where is your policy? On each occasion he has refused to answer that question. There is no explanation for it other than that the Government has no further policies. It has nothing new to offer at all. In other words, what it offers the people of Australia is its record and achievement&mdash;more of the same, more of the same picture that has resulted in the worst unemployment situation in over 60 years. The Australian people should be furious about that. They deserve more, and they are not getting it from this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In asking the Minister this question today, I suggested to him a few options that he might consider&mdash;options that are included in the coalition's Fightback package to rejuvenate and rebuild Australia. They are good, sound, sensible ideas. I started by suggesting the funding of the abolition of payroll tax, which is worth $5.8 billion in this country and which is a direct tax on jobs. What did the Minister say? He said, `That's irrelevant to job creation. We are not interested in that'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Madam Acting Deputy President, I remind you that in 1985 at the Tax Summit Senator Button had something to say about payroll tax. Senator Button is grinning at this, but he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would propose that we refer the question of payroll tax to that forum, with the strong direction that the Summit believes every effort should be made to reduce or eliminate this tax.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what he said in 1985. He knows it is a tax on jobs, yet his Government will not support it&mdash;and the reason that his Government will not support it is that it is in the coalition's Fightback policy; not because it is not in Australia's best interests, but because it is within the Opposition's policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I went on and gave other alternatives. I asked, `Why don't you reform or restructure the tax system as we have suggested in a way that will take $1.7 billion off tax on exports?'. We all know that to do something about the growth figure and to control debt we need to transfer more opportunities into exports. He said, `No, we are not interested in taking these taxes off exports at all, because that would require the sort of tax restructuring that the coalition is proposing and we are not interested in that'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked, `What about the $9.4 billion of wholesale sales tax which is retarding economic growth and job creation opportunities in this country?'. He said, `No, we are not prepared to do that either'. I said, `Why don't you do what the coalition has said; that is, structure a tax system whereby you can cut one-third off income tax and provide a real incentive to Australian business to grow, expand and provide jobs?'. He said, `No. We are not interested in doing that either'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Government is offering is nothing new at all. It is more of the same; more of the tragedy we have had in this country under the Labor Party's record for the last 10 years. Senator Short followed the question up with one directly on the policy paralysis, giving the Minister yet another opportunity to say what he and his Government offer as an alternative for the next election. In that way the people could at least have a choice, because at the moment the choice is simply between his record&mdash;one of failure on anyone's analysis&mdash;and the constructive alternative policies that have been put forward by the coalition. In effect, he again said, `I am not going to answer the question'. He talked through the question and about all sorts of other things but he did not even attempt to provide an answer to that question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am restricted to 10 minutes in this democratic break-up of time. I hope that in that very restricted timeframe I have indicated the importance of this issue. That is what we want to have debated today&mdash;the issue and the fact that the Government's policy program has ground to a halt and that the Prime Minister himself has said that the micro-economic agenda is more or less complete. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the Government offers no new or better alternatives at all. The fact is that it is going to the Australian people on its record. It is offering its record and more of the same.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am quoting from the Governor of the Reserve Bank and the quotation which he made fits those opposite. But it is not only the Governor of the Reserve Bank; listen to the shadow Minister, John Howard&mdash;`Honest John Howard' as he is sometimes called. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>and fall they would have to do, staggering drunkenly across the line&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that overnight we could pull unemployment down.</PARA>
<PARA>He agrees with 75 per cent of economists. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Anybody who runs around saying that is not coming clean. I am not making any promises about the level of unemployment. There will be no transition effects.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what John Howard said on this unemployment issue about which the Opposition is now making so much. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Mr Reith, said on Monday:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe jobs will come if we are elected.</PARA>
<PARA>`I believe', he said. When this issue of the solution to unemployment was raised and flushed out at Question Time today, those opposite all started to interject about payroll tax, for goodness sake. Just listen to what the preliminary inventor of the GST, Professor John Freebairn, said about payroll tax as a generator of unemployment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unlike the coalition, I believe the swap of a GST for payroll tax will have virtually no effect on employment or unemployment levels. The economic effects of a consumption tax and a payroll tax are similar.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say more on the same point. All I am saying to those opposite is that they launched this urgency motion. They came in here and said, `We have the policies which are the answer'. But nobody else thinks so; and that is their problem. That is why it is urgent today&mdash;because nobody outside this place believes them about these issues. </PARA>

There is no merit in people who opposed the reduction of interest rates and fiscal stimulus coming in here and saying that they would have done better. There is honesty in what Mr Howard says; there is truth in what Professor Freebairn says about payroll tax. There is no truth in this belief put about by people like Mr Reith. He said that he believes that somehow the Opposition would create jobs. Economists do not agree with him and many of the other people to whom I have referred do not agree with him either. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's problem is: why do all these things become urgent? It is not because any new massive crisis in the Australian economy has emerged this week as a result of a $1.8 billion current account deficit, for example. The urgency is that those opposite see that the hired consultants have led them up the garden path. They see that people like Dr Hewson, Jim Short and Peter Reith, who were part of the cabal that went off to the consultants, have been led up the garden path. Those opposite look at the remedies which the consultants proposed over the last two years for rectifying the Australian economy and find they are all wrong. That is the problem. So the urgency arises because, true, the current account deficit went up, but so did the approval rating of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). As other indicators go down, so John Hewson's approval rating goes down and so the approval rating of the Opposition goes down. </PARA>

<PARA>We have just heard the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) defending the indefensible and the Opposition using precisely the same tools to attack the indefensible. The reality is that Australians outside this place are genuinely very concerned. In the gallery at the present time are some schoolchildren who are visiting the Senate. There are also other people in the gallery. Those who are still in employment recognise that wages generally, with the exception of those at the top of the scale, have fallen steadily over the years of the Labor Government. Those who are not in employment are feeling desperate disillusion; they are turning to drugs; they have higher rates of suicide and higher rates of crime. The situation is one which is serious and one which is not being addressed by either the Government or the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, one finds that the same infection which infected the remarks in the last half hour of both the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Hill) and the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) has spread into the senior levels of the bureaucracy&mdash;into Treasury, Finance and Prime Minister and Cabinet. I am referring specifically to so-called economic rationalism. A book by John Carroll, by no means a leftie, and Robert Manne called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Shutdown</EMPHASIS> states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Economic rationalists have wired themselves up to highly abstract, mathematical models of a fantasy economy, and then deluded themselves that they are making realistic policy. </PARA>
<PARA>That summarises very nicely what we have just been listening to. The response of government to the present worsening economic climate is totally inadequate. In that respect, we agree with the motion moved by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scale of the crisis is such that it is simply not good enough for Senator Button to turn around and say, `Well, it is bad in other countries as well'; to point to the high unemployment rates in other European countries, for instance, and say, `Well, Australia is a middling country'; and to point to the level of debt in those countries as say, `Well, Australia is about the middle, therefore, it is okay'. It is a serious problem. Australians are genuinely worried about it. It is inappropriate for the Government to attempt to excuse itself on those grounds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is absolutely true, as Senator Button said, that the Government has attempted to internationalise the Australian economy. It is part of the economic rationalist belief that free trade will somehow benefit Australians. The proof of the pudding is in the eating. This has not happened. In the last 10 years since the Labor Government has been in office, economic racialism has produced a worsening economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen the flow of wealth from the less well off to the wealthy in the misguided belief that the more wealthy people become, the more they will invest in productive investment and the economy would recover. We were told that after a trickle up, we would see a trickle down and, as a consequence, those who were less well off would become employed and the economy would recover. This has not happened. It will not happen under the Opposition either. The Opposition will pursue, with greater vigour, precisely the same sorts of policies. The trickle up and trickle down principle simply does not work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor governments in South Australia and in other States have also pursued precisely the same sort of free market and speculative agenda. We see that in the case of the State Bank of South Australia. Mr Bannon attempted to excuse himself by saying that he thought the operations of the bank would be profitable, whereas he should be ashamed that he allowed the bank to continue with the same sort of speculative activity which has brought the rest of this country to its knees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under a deregulated regime, money which flowed to the more wealthy did not go into productive investment; it went instead into speculation, particularly into property speculation. A great deal of it went offshore. A lot of it simply went down the shute as inefficient speculators became bankrupt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal task of government is not to defend some abstract ideology. The principal task of government is to look after the citizens of a country. As John Carroll says in his book, economic racialism has failed every practical test by which one wants to measure it. Every promise which has been made by the economic rationalists over the last 10 years has simply not been fulfilled and has turned out to be false. Of course, one must stress again that the pattern which the Opposition would impose on this country is of the same kind. It would simply screw down harder the thumb screws of economic rationalism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite have turned their attention particularly to industrial relations. They point out that a deregulated industrial relations system would work better in this deregulated economy. I ask those opposite to look at the example of Canada, where the level of education, the size of the population, the distribution of the population and the wealth of the country are very similar to Australia. Contrary to Australia, Canada does not have the centralised wage fixing system that we have in this country. Yet Canada finds itself in precisely the same situation as Australia is in. So the idea of the Opposition, which is that a deregulated labour market will turn the other aspect of deregulation into some sort of profit and benefit for this country, will simply not be realised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is needed in this country is a good dose of re-regulation and government policies which intervene on the part of ordinary Australians to turn this economy around. We need to ensure that tariffs are left in place for those industries which still have tariff protection. We need to hang onto those industries that we still have. We need to reimpose quotas on imports. It is absolutely ridiculous that we continue to import large amounts of goods which we produce in this country. We imported $2.3 billion worth of food last year&mdash;all of it material which we can produce here. That is the policy that we need to pursue, and it is simply inadequate for the Government to defend itself on the grounds that other countries are worse off than we are. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need to condemn the Labor Government for its total policy paralysis and failure to address the economic crisis facing Australia&mdash;where there are now one million people unemployed, a record foreign debt of $200 billion, and a massive and worsening current account deficit.</PARA>
<PARA>The release of the national accounts, balance of payments and foreign debt figures over the last two days has reinforced the ever-increasing evidence of the disaster that the Australian economy is now facing. It also reinforces what we have known for a long time: this Government has no idea how to deal with these problems. It is paralysed. The figures speak for themselves: the horrendous current account deficit of $1.8 billion for October and the foreign debt breaking the $200 billion barrier in the September quarter, which is equal to $44,000 for each average family in Australia. The net percentage of debt to our national income has grown under this Government from 10 per cent in 1982 to a whopping 42 per cent today. That gross debt now, as a proportion of our national income, exceeds 50 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the figures suggest that the economy is growing overall, albeit very slowly, private non-farm growth declined in the September quarter. There was negative growth in the September quarter in private non-farm GDP. Private consumption expenditure is flat. Private capital expenditure continues to decline. There was a negative contribution to growth from net exports. There is no basis whatsoever for reading any kind of sustainable recovery into these figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Faced with this undeniable condemnation from the facts of the Government's policies, or lack of them, there is no prospect of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) or the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) doing anything at all to redress or address the deep-seated problems which are at the heart of the malaise which they have caused. This crisis has been caused by this Government and, in particular, this Prime Minister, who has been the self-confessed architect of the economic policies of this Government for a decade now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are now caught in a vacuum of policy paralysis until the election. Even the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Bernie Fraser, who tried to put the very best gloss on the situation the other day, has called for a White Paper. In his press conference yesterday, the Treasurer said that he did not think that was necessary because White Papers required new policies and this Government was not considering any of those. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What will it take to get this Government to recognise the problems that it has created? How can it be shaken out of its complacency? It has no answers and is not interested in finding any. As Terry McCrann wrote in the press yesterday:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we have a Prime Minister determined to win the coming election at any cost. And that cost is the future of Australia . . . we have a Government ruthlessly feeding fear and uncertainty about the reforms we desperately need.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that those views of Terry McCrann are echoed by countless millions around this country. Not only does this Government have no policies, but it wants to stand in the way of those who do. Yet the situation is very, very grave. Things have gone from bad to worse since the banana republic statement that the then Treasurer, Mr Keating, made some 6 1/2 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at how things have moved since Mr Keating told us 6 1/2 years ago that we needed an `internal economic adjustment' and that `if we don't make it this time, we will never make it', as he said in May 1986. Back in May 1986 our net debt compared with that of the rest of the world was less than half of what it is today. Mr Keating called that a crisis. If he calls that a crisis&mdash;and it was&mdash;where on earth are we now? The September quarter figures which were announced yesterday showed a truly staggering net foreign debt position of $163,000m. That represents a growth of 9 per cent in the last three months alone and it is a figure something like eight times that which the Government inherited back in 1983. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The prospective Federal Government Budget deficit for this year is now over $9 billion higher than it was in 1985-86, even though Mr Keating in the banana republic interview in May 1986 suggested:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we have got to slow imports and that means cutting back the public sector.</PARA>
<PARA>Unemployment in May 1986 was 7.8 per cent. Today, with nearly 400,000 more people unemployed than there were in May 1986, it is 11.3 per cent. Mr Keating also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is private sector activity which will put the activity in place to give us a better level of local production against imports.</PARA>
<PARA>But since 1986, private business investment has fallen as a proportion of GDP from 11.3 per cent to 8.6 per cent. Yesterday's national accounts figures indicate a continuing decline in business investment, the engine of growth of the whole economy. The Reserve Bank Governor has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the message of modern growth theories is that the more you invest, the faster you grow.</PARA>
<PARA>He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the need to boost investment to boost growth is widely accepted.</PARA>
<PARA>Given our abysmal investment performance, we have no prospect of a sustained export led recovery while Labor remains in office. Labor has been mouthing the same platitudes for 10 years but it has delivered absolutely nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those comparisons with 1986 show the abject failure of every so-called initiative since the banana republic statement days. We have gone backwards, not forwards, since the days when the present Prime Minister said that we should be taking every action to avoid becoming a banana republic. The only progress we are making is along the Argentinean road. Criticism of the lack of policies to address this disastrous situation is not just coming from the Opposition, it is coming from the Government's own economic advisers, from within the Government itself, from the business community, and from the millions of Australians who have either lost their jobs or been otherwise cruelly hit by the failed policies and the policy paralysis of this Government. The ALP's own Federal President, Barry Jones, said in Perth this week that the Government&mdash;and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . would need to do more than just knock the Coalition's policies to win the election.</PARA>
<PARA>He is absolutely right. The truth of that statement was made absolutely clear in the recently released Industry Commission report, which noted&mdash;and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . our progressive slippage down the ranking of OECD countries in terms of per capita incomes. Many countries in the Asia-Pacific region are also catching us.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yet the Treasurer tries to kid us that we are possibly `the fastest growing economy in the OECD'. He said that three times in his press conference yesterday, as if saying it enough times might make it true. Well, it is not true. We are not making the grade on growth or on anything else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government's inept approach to micro-economic reform has also been highlighted in a report from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in the last day or so, which states that `the micro-economic reform agenda is not complete'. This report calls for further reforms on the waterfront and in transport sectors to fully exploit the export opportunities arising in the South East Asian region. Again, only yesterday, the Treasurer was emphasising the importance of tying in to the Asian region. He said that we need to `maintain our attachment and our economic integration with the more rapidly growing countries of Asia', but it is clear from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade report that it is not acting to deliver that. That report echoes the Industry Commission report released last week which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in light of what governments must do to lift Australia's economic performance, reform initiatives have been lacking in number and scope.</PARA>
<PARA>The Industry Commission report makes a very strong case that, without accelerating the pace of micro-economic reform on a broad front, unemployment will remain at high levels for the rest of the decade, even if strong growth starts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the worst recession in 60 years, our debt continues to balloon, our imports continue to outstrip our exports and the economic gloom just grows and grows. Faced with all this, the Government sits on its hands. It is paralysed. The third most senior Minister in the Government, Senator Button, went through his usual charade today without once mentioning anything original.

The first thing that needs to be said, and said in very clear and unequivocal terms, is that there is no policy paralysis evident at any level of the Australian Government or at any level of the ALP. Precisely the opposite is true. The policy grid-lock that is evident in Australian politics grips the coalition. It is handcuffed, and apparently happily handcuffed, to two losers&mdash;the goods and services tax and Dr Hewson, the Leader of the Opposition. There is no other way to explain the simple fact that over the last six months, as the economy has proved more sluggish than was believed to be the case earlier in 1992, the coalition has simply slid away by every measurement in the polls.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It could well be, as Paul Kelly outlined in his book entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The End of Certainty</EMPHASIS> published just a few weeks ago, that the 1980s did bring to a conclusion an age in which political certainty was readily apparent and that we have moved into an age of uncertainty. It is beyond question that the coalition during the 1980s, in so far as its political leadership was concerned, was the most uncertain institution in the country, evidenced by the apparent revolving door. Perhaps in the 1990s we have moved into a period of uncertainty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the publicly available material seems to be suggesting that as times become more uncertain, people identify more closely with the policies of the Labor Government&mdash;the policies of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and those who sit on this side of the chamber.

There is no question either that the runs are on the board in terms of efficiencies in industry, of productivity&mdash;the waterfront being a classic case in point&mdash;or achievement, particularly in the manufacturing industry. If we look at the manufacturing industry in terms of exports or productivity improvements, the record is there. It is a record of accomplishment. That is a record we are quite happy to argue early in 1993. On this side there is a preparedness to be flexible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposite, of course, there is utter gridlock. Since the GST became holy writ&mdash;since it was handed down in tablet form&mdash;the coalition has stayed absolutely manacled to it and will remain so, despite the fact that the GST was brought down the best part of 18 months ago when economic circumstances were entirely different.

Exports dropped 11 per cent in October but they rose by 12 per cent in September&mdash;to put matters in a better perspective. The drop in exports was particularly marked for gold and other metals, for example, and had a carry-on effect upon the figures generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Manufacturing export figures were also disappointing. But let us put it in the context of the simple reality that manufactured exports for the three months to October remained 14 per cent above the level of a year ago. That is a good record to argue.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator O'Chee made some remarks about Australia being the Argentina of South East Asia. That ought not to be laughed at only in this chamber; it would be laughed at in Argentina. Not only does Argentina not represent our future, but also it never represented our past. I had the privilege of visiting Latin America a few months ago with a parliamentary delegation. We do not have the problems that Argentina has experienced and is experiencing.

The people who will be hit hardest are those least able to defend themselves. Look at the overseas experience in terms of the impact of the GST, the new impost. For example, look at the Australian Consumer Association's assessment of what happened in New Zealand. The association warned that 30 per cent of the savings from the abolition of taxes similar to those which the coalition claims it is about to abolish in New Zealand were not passed on to consumers.

In terms of the contest that looms in the autumn of 1993, the Opposition has manacled itself, handcuffed and smiling, to two losers&mdash;Dr Hewson and the GST. The ultimate judgment which will be passed upon the Opposition in 1993 will be very similar to the judgment being passed upon it in the polls right now, that is, another rejection. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is pretty hard to deny that Australia is now in deep economic trouble. The question for Australians is whether what the Opposition proposes would be any more of a solution to these troubles than what they are served up from this Government. Last month's current account deficit of nearly $2 billion prefaces a nightmare scenario in Australia in which we have, as many other senators have said, large increases in imports, a collapse in exports, still sluggish growth and increasing unemployment. At the same time, we have a continued deterioration in our foreign debt position which constrains domestic growth options.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is what appears to be happening: the growth rate is not quick enough to stop unemployment increasing, and a balance of payments crisis is looming again. In the last week we have seen an appalling balance of payments figure and weak growth performance, as evidenced in the Australian national accounts. These figures have quite rightly received national media attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, another very important study was released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on 30 November which has gone largely unnoticed. The study includes a review of foreign debt statistics published in the Bureau's monthly <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Economic Indicators</EMPHASIS>. This review reveals the alarming statistic that Australia's foreign debt has been increasing at the rate of almost 30 per cent per year since the mid-1970s; it is not something that just came in coincidentally with this Labor Government. In 1976 net foreign debt was just $2.4 billion. By 1980&mdash;still under a coalition government&mdash;it had almost trebled to $6.9 billion. In 1984 it was $30 billion; in 1986 it was $75 billion and it is now $160 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scale of the problem is indicated by the ratio of net debt to gross domestic product. This was 5 per cent in 1976, 10 per cent in 1982 and 42 per cent yesterday. So it doubled in percentage terms under a coalition government but it has quadrupled since then. So in half a generation we have increased our foreign indebtedness by over 1,000 per cent. If the rate of this increase in foreign debt continues, we will undoubtedly see the International Monetary Fund intervening in the management of Australia within the next decade or two. Our economic sovereignty is clearly threatened in the medium to longer term by this trend. The cost of servicing this debt is also growing exponentially. In 1980-81, net interest payable abroad was one per cent of GDP, but it is currently running at 3 per cent. It would have been higher had it not been for a sharp drop in interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unemployment is clearly the greatest economic and social issue facing this country. It has been estimated by the Catholic Social Welfare Commission that unemployment is costing the Government between $10 billion and $18 billion. So the cost of providing benefits to those without work and the tax which would have been collected on their wages, plus payroll taxes, amounts to $10 billion to $18 billion. The fact that this is still trending upwards is the most terrifying aspect of the unemployment figures. For the last generation we have seen the underlying rate of unemployment ratchet upwards after each period of economic decline and we have also seen the average length of time of unemployment increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that the market will not deliver decent levels of employment for many years to come, if at all. We as a country are going to have to share the employment opportunities. We are going to have to accept lower living standards imposed on us by the rest of the world. We are going to have to ensure that what that entails, the load that that brings, is fairly shared across the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I agree with the Opposition that there is a crisis. It has not been taken seriously early enough by this Labor Government. However, I do not agree that there has been a policy paralysis. I think that is without foundation. We sit here every day and we have dozens of pieces of legislation implementing Government policy. Where I think there has been a problem is in the need to review the delivery of these policies. At least there are a few meagre signs that this Government is having a rethink about the level of intervention that is necessary in our economy. This is quite different from the solutions being offered by the Opposition. I think the first part of the motion could just as well read `The need to condemn the Opposition for its total policy paralysis' in so far as it is proposing failed economic rationalist policies of the 1980s. It is proposing a net cut of $4 billion in government spending. It is proposing smaller government and a reduction in services. That will lead to unemployment. The Opposition's solutions do not guarantee employment. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XW4">Senator KERNOT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that. The Opposition is saying that it is going to hold inflation at 2 per cent. That will lead to interest rate increases, it will be an extra oncost to business and it will lead to the spiral of having to put people off in order to cope. Senator Hill said today in Question Time that one of the solutions would be the abolition of payroll tax. We agree. He said, `Do something about the tax on exports'. We agree. He said, `Abolish the wholesale sales tax and reduce personal income tax'. We all know that there is going to be this marvellous trickle-down effect, and that reducing personal income tax has this miraculous link with increased productivity. There is absolutely no link between reducing personal income tax rates and higher productivity. In fact, United States studies actually show the converse.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to quickly respond to a few comments made by previous speakers. Firstly, I want to comment on Senator Button's lacklustre defence of our massive foreign debt. He said that we have to admit that we have a problem. But he then in defence said that the debt servicing element is not as bad as it was last year. Senator O'Chee responded to that point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I want to respond to Senator Loosley's comments, particularly about handcuffing ourselves to Dr John Hewson and the Fightback program of policies. We do not see ourselves on the Opposition benches as being handcuffed; we see ourselves as proudly placing before Australians, some 18 months before the election, a program of sweeping reform&mdash;which is long overdue&mdash;nailing those policy flags to the mast and ensuring to the best of our ability that they are explained to Australians so that they will be able to vote at the next poll knowing full well the Opposition's policies. We will accept their judgment when the election day comes, whenever Paul Keating, the Prime Minister, decides to hold it. We have not heard from any Government speakers any defence of the fact that the Government seems to have no policy solution to either Australia's massive unemployment problem or the rapidly rising foreign debt problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Loosley then used the US analogy, which I will continue to pick him up on. The greatest use of that analogy is in looking at the very close links between the Reagan and Bush policies and the policies followed by the Hawke and Keating governments. The great failure of the Reagan era&mdash;there were many successes in it, particularly in foreign policy terms&mdash;was to match the tax cuts put through Congress early in his term with expenditure reductions. The US Government's debt and current account problems that were well and truly predicted by David Stockman about six or seven years ago have come true and have brought about the ultimate demise of both the US economy and the Reagan-Bush Republican tenure in the White House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Loosley's next comment, which certainly requires rebuttal, concerned his Government's record on taxation. He referred to the Government's reductions in the top marginal tax rates, which are very similar to what Ronald Reagan and George Bush did in the United States; they brought down tax rates but did not do anything about matching those tax cuts with expenditure cuts. This Government has cut top marginal tax rates, but it has done almost nothing for middle income earners and even less for low income earners. As I said earlier today in a previous debate, it has been the low and middle income earners that have lost out the most under this Labor Government, which is supposed to be representing that section of the population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality of taxes during the term of this Government is that there has been a total increase of taxation in real terms of 39 per cent against GDP growth of 32.45 per cent. PAYE tax has risen 14 per cent; company tax, 63 per cent; superannuation taxes, 2,573 per cent; withholding tax, 113 per cent; sales taxes, 53 per cent; and petrol taxes, 205 per cent. All are real figures in 1991-92 dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government's taxation record is a disgrace, both in terms of total collections and the complexity of its tax system, which has become a major impediment to business in Australia. It is an impediment that Senator Button, in his more erudite moments, has admitted makes Australia uncompetitive. I am prepared to accept that this Government will not reform the tax system or the industrial relations system. It has talked about it but done nothing, and I am prepared to accept that for ideological reasons it will not do anything. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to spend the few minutes remaining to me focusing on the things the Government could do and which many commentators are urging it to do, which is to get on with micro-economic reform. It has talked about it for 10 years. As someone said, micro-economic reform is now being uttered by parrots and galahs around Australia because the phrase has been said so often. Parrots and galahs are repeating it, but very few people know what it means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government made a commitment in the One Nation statement to pump money into railways and infrastructure reform. Only a few days ago we read in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) that $170m&mdash;I will be corrected if I am wrong&mdash;has been taken out of the railway reform program and is being pumped into making more pine log fences and painting rocks white as a short term, bandaid servicing of the unemployment problem. This nation needs infrastructure reform, and it needs efficient railways, roads, ports and shipping. This Government has failed to do anything about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the example of waterfront reform. Senator Loosley said that he is happy to go to the people with the achievements of waterfront reform. In this week's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS>, Robert Gottleibsen said of the Government's achievements in this area:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost of government services and transport . . . have not come down because reform has been too slow. The waterfront reforms have become a joke as the waterfront and shipping industry have pocketed the productivity gains, leaving exporters little better off.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no use having reform on the waterfront unless our exporters are better off as a result. We need to cut costs there and increase Australia's competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Treasurer, John Dawkins, said yesterday, the only way to pay this foreign debt is to export more, ensure that we export more than we import, become competitive and achieve a turnaround. That will not occur unless we have the reform which this Government has failed to carry out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Shipping reform is often spoken about, but little is done about it. There is still the stupid trans-Tasman agreement which is protected because of a trade union brotherhood across the Tasman. Australian coastal trade is protected from competition, and a range of reforms could take place in relation to the Australian National Line. This week's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> refers to the Minister for Industrial Relations, Peter Cook, as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . dragging the chain on deciding whether to introduce a range of shipping reforms.</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Mining Industry Council suggests that the Government is trying to go slow on these reforms to try to maximise the price of ANL. The Government is deluding itself on both counts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other area of reform is road transport. The Government knows that its own Caucus and back bench committee has referred the impact of sales taxes on transport to the Minister. These are reforms that the Opposition has faced up to in the Fightback package to ensure that the cost of transporting things across Australia is reduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other area is infrastructure and whether the private or public sector should be funding it. Of course, the great reform that the Government introduced this year in the Budget was the decision to treat limited partnerships as companies for taxation purposes, again stifling&mdash;if not destroying&mdash;a great avenue of private sector investment infrastructure. That is the Government's great contribution to infrastructure reform this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debate leading up to this election will be about change and who can introduce that change. The coalition has a program of sweeping reform. However, we agree that the Australian people must feel that this change will take place at a pace that will protect their living standards. That is why the Fightback package is very careful to ensure that low and middle income earners will be protected with rises in pensions and family allowances, cuts in their personal taxation and a whole range of measures. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to be able to contribute to this debate today on the urgency motion moved by Senator Hill. I will not read the entire motion. Suffice to say, basically it states that this country is in a desperate mess and the people on the Government side of the chamber have no plan to fix it. In fact, they have policy paralysis. They have no idea how to get out of the mess they got us into.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first contribution on behalf of the Government was made by Senator Button&mdash;who is now so interested in this debate that he is reading <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The best of bad Hemingway</EMPHASIS>. Nonetheless, in the very beginning he asserted that we are an intellectually bereft Opposition. Having made that assertion, did he offer a plan to indicate that the Government had any intellectual capacity to address these problems? No! He accused us of being intellectually bereft but offered no plan himself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his contribution he took some more time to go over old debates. No doubt someone in the Public Service has been digging around in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> looking for a few quotes he could chip in with here and there. He took up a bit more time so that he would not have to offer a plan then either or answer as to why the Government does not have a plan to get us out of the problems we are in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He then sought to justify the appalling unemployment rate in this country by pointing to other nations which have similar rates. An unemployed person does not give a damn what the unemployment rate is in any other country. That person actually does not care what the rate is here, because as far as that person is concerned he or she is 100 per cent unemployed. I notice that Senator Button was particularly selective in his choice of the areas where he was prepared to contrast Australia with other nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, I notice that he did not tell us that our labour productivity growth through the 1980s&mdash;the time in which his Government was in charge&mdash;was an average 40 per cent below the OECD average. Senator Button is keen to compare in some respects but not in others. Why would we engage in this comparison with other nations when the problem we have is here in Australia with the economic malaise and mess created by this Government? It is not relevant to see what is happening elsewhere in that respect. Why waste the time on that when the Government has no plan and no idea of how to fix it!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to Senator Loosley's contribution to this debate. Senator Loosley has a particular debating style which is to stand up and make particular assertions but then to offer no facts to back them up. He said that it was clear and unequivocal that there was no policy paralysis in the Government. In my office I turned my television up thinking, `Here it is coming; it is clear and unequivocal that there is no policy paralysis. They have got a plan and they are going to let everybody in on it'. However, Senator Loosley dropped that point and went on to something else; it was a mere assertion. All this Government does is assert that it knows what it is doing. If the economic conditions under which Australians are suffering are evidence that this Government is doing the best it can, we had better get rid of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Loosley went further than that. For example, he said that the economic circumstances were different when we&mdash;that is, the Labor Party&mdash;wanted a GST. There is one thing that absolutely has not changed that is one of the key reasons for shifting to a GST. Those wholesale sales taxes are still on the production process. They carry through and make us uncompetitive. That was the case then and it is the case now. In terms of that aspect promoting of a GST, what else has changed is irrelevant. The main reason to shift to a goods and services tax is to take out all those unnecessary taxes that are cascading through the system, building up the price of our goods and services and thus making them uncompetitive, and spread them out over all consumers in an even and fair way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The best that Senator Loosley could say in relation to the balance of payments figure was that it was disappointing. He may as well say, `Let them eat cake'. Frankly, I do not care whether or not he is disappointed. We want to know what the Government plans to do to improve the situation. This urgency motion is all about condemning the Government for not having a plan to get out of this. The motion condemns the Labor Government for having a policy paralysis. The fact that Senator Loosley is disappointed is quite inconsequential to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Loosley then went on to make an even better point, as far as he was concerned&mdash;that Bill Clinton is going to follow the Labor Party policies in that he is going to have a summit like Labor had in 1983 or 1984. I am writing to everyone I know in the United States and saying, `Get out of there now'. If the Clinton Administration is going to start following the policies of this Government, if it looks at what has happened to this nation since Labor has been in office and says, `That is a good idea. Let's follow that', then people had better get out of there fast. Even Senator Loosley would not be bold enough to make that assertion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we hear about Senator Maguire's dear little newsletter frightening the hell out of everyone about the price of goods going up, food in particular. There is no denying that the price of some food and some clothing will go up but the price of some other things will come down. I have had a good look at Senator Maguire's newsletters and I have not seen much in there about personal income tax; I have not seen much about it being $11 cheaper to fill the tank of the family car. I see the Labor Party sending out propaganda focusing on our plans&mdash;but only on the negative parts and not promoting any of the positives. I would like to see Senator Maguire writing something about his own Government's policies. The reason he has to remark about our policies is that the Government does not have any. This Government is suffering from a policy paralysis, as asserted by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Hill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since Senator Button was good enough to take us on a little trip back through the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, I thought it might be interesting in the closing minute or two of my speech to draw the Senate's attention to some of the things that this Government, through its Leader, has told the Australian people over a period. This one is a gem. In 1990&mdash;only two years ago&mdash;as part of the Budget Speech, the former Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Economic policy has worked and is working . . . the current account deficit will improve markedly and employment will pick up. In short, the kind of outcome the Government was seeking, delivered without the misery and despair of high unemployment and a savage recession.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what the Prime Minister was saying only two years ago and look where we are now. Similarly, in 1990 he said that we would:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . see the investment coming home, the capital stock going into place, the production rising, the current account declining . . .</PARA>
<PARA>We know that is not true now. This is the investment Senator Button is always talking about in plant and equipment that does not ever eventuate. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When that happens, all of this imagery will change at such a pace that I really will have, I'm sure, some difficulty dealing with the popularity breakout.</PARA>
<PARA>He has to have tickets on himself, doesn't he? In 1990 he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We won't have a scorched earth policy, we won't destroy business activity, we won't destroy employment . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In 1990, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We won't let there be a recession.</PARA>
<PARA>Worse still, at the end of that year the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I knew there had to be one but I didn't want to tell you.</PARA>
<PARA>That tells us what we get from this Government: promises that it will get better. We can see from the Government's record that it does not. What we want to know now is: what plans has it to fix the problem? What can it do to break the policy paralysis it suffers from?</PARA>

At no point in this motion is there any reference to us removing price inflation as a disease in the Australian economy. Those opposite do not want to talk about it. They do not want to know about the record of getting inflation out of the economic system in Australia. As I have reminded people in the Opposition time and time again, the reality is that when they left office in March 1983 price inflation was 11 1/2 per cent per annum. We had double digit inflation under the Opposition when it was last in government. Prices under this Government have now been wound back to 0.8 per cent in the consumer price index. </PARA>

It is also very low compared with the five western European countries and Japan which have historically been regarded as the world's low inflation countries. Inflation and prices in Australia are now below the rates in countries such as Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Switzerland and so forth. It is a very big achievement. The reduction in prices has been a response to Labor policy deregulating the Australian economy and of more competition.

In fact, since January 1990, when we first made reductions in interest rates, there have been 13 rounds of cuts in interest rates under this Government.

It forecast 3 per cent real economic growth in Australia in the 1993 calendar year. What did Westpac say about New Zealand&mdash;that darling of the conservatives?

This private enterprise organisation is making its forecasts for the next calendar year with Australia coming out on top of those tables with the highest growth of those three countries. We are told time and again that this country is in crisis, but the international perspective is not that at all.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is some reference in this motion to Australia's current account deficit. In typical Opposition fashion it is reported in isolation. The motion does not relate the current account deficit to the size of the Australian economy. It is very simplistic; it is very naive. It does not in any way relate the size of the current account deficit and our overseas balance of payments to the level of spending or to production in the Australian community. That is what has to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If meaningful comparisons are to be made between Australia now and Australia in the past, it is necessary to relate the current account deficit to the size of the economy. If comparisons are to be made between Australia and other countries, they must be done on a common basis; it is necessary to relate the current account deficit to the size of the economy. It is very illuminating when one goes through that exercise. The Opposition's current spokesman for industrial relations, Mr John Howard, was Treasurer in 1981-82. What was the current account deficit at that time as a proportion of gross domestic product? It was a whopping 5.6 per cent. The current account deficit represented more than one-twentieth of the Australian economy. For this current financial year, it is likely to be 3 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we put the current account deficit in perspective in relation to the size of the Australian economy, clearly Australia's performance now is relatively better than it was when the Liberals were last in power in 1981-82. We are being told in this motion that Australia is in crisis, yet the Opposition shadow Minister for industrial relations presided over a balance of payments current account deficit of 5.6 per cent of gross domestic product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other very annoying thing about this debate is the Opposition's focus on all the bad news. Those opposite do not tell us about the positive things in the balance of payments. I heard Senator Loosley refer to the 14 per cent growth in manufactured exports up to October. That is the sort of thing that those opposite will not talk about. They will not talk about the massive growth in the pharmaceutical industry in Australia&mdash;the massive growth in pharmaceutical exports. They will not talk about the massive growth in exports of ships from Australia. Mr Acting Deputy President, you would know something about that, living in Hobart. The Australian shipbuilding industry is becoming very successful in exporting ships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard Senator O'Chee talking about Argentina. I recently had the privilege of being in Buenos Aires. The relevant comparison to be made is that Australia is now exporting hydrofoils from Tasmania to Argentina to operate on the River Plate between Buenos Aires and Montevideo in Uruguay. We can do these things. They are happening in large numbers and at high value. We are selling computer equipment overseas. Importantly, from the perspective of my State of South Australia, the wine industry is experiencing massive growth in exports. In the last year there was a growth in export of Australian wine of between 30 per cent and 40 per cent&mdash;not 3 per cent or 4 per cent&mdash;achieving a figure of $230m in the last financial year. The target for Australian wine exports at the turn of the century is not $300m or $400m; it is $1,000m. That is very achievable indeed. It is enormously good news for my State of South Australia, which contributes 51 per cent of the grape crush. It is clear that all States of Australia have an enormous comparative advantage in the wine industry. The price of vineyard land is very cheap in Australia compared with the Northern Hemisphere. Some very good potential for growth for Australia is coming from the wine industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also point out, again from the perspective of the Liberals talking about Australia being in crisis, that Australia now exports 21 per cent to 22 per cent of its gross domestic product. When the Liberals were last in office the figure was 15 per cent at best. That just shows the extent to which the Australian economy has become internationalised and how the structural reforms and structural changes which have taken place now make it possible for us to export a much greater proportion of our gross domestic product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Meanwhile, we have an Opposition that wants to bring in a goods and services tax. Somehow it believes that there are still such things as economic panaceas&mdash;that if we pull one lever the whole economy will fall into place in a perfect and blissful way. It wants to bring in a goods and services tax because it thinks it will fix the economy. The reality is that it will do enormous damage to the Australian tourism industry&mdash;a key export industry which does very important, positive things in terms of our balance of payments. When the Liberals were last in power in 1982-83, about a half of million overseas visitors a year came to Australia. Now the figure is about 2 1/2 million overseas visitors per annum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the Liberals want to put a tax on holidays in Australia. When people pick up their brochures in New York or Tokyo they will find that the cost of holidays in Australia has gone up compared with those in other countries. There will be a bigger incentive for Australians to go overseas than to take their holidays in Australia because there will be tax on tourism in Australia. Although they might like to, the Liberals cannot apply a tax in Rio, Hawaii or wherever. It will be a big kick-start for Australians to go overseas.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General's eighth report of 1992-93 addresses fundamental issues in the repatriation system. The report has been a very long time in coming, reflecting the scope of the issues investigated by the Auditor. Work apparently began in April 1991. The tabling of the report was scheduled for November 1991. It has now finally reached the Parliament more than 12 months later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General has clearly made a very thorough review based on a lot of research of the compensation subprogram and associated areas. The report represents the first major review in the Veterans' Affairs portfolio since the introduction of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. In this sense, it is extremely valuable because it provides a contemporary analysis of repatriation practices and legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report questions fundamental aspects of the compensation subprogram and the associated legislation. In the Auditor-General's view, the subprogram and supporting legislation do not adequately reflect the consequences of the ageing of the veteran population; the needs of younger veterans, in particular those suffering psychiatric conditions; or the need for equitable treatment of veterans and their dependants. There is strong criticism of program management. The Auditor suggests that there is little accountability and that the Repatriation Commission and the Department of Veterans' Affairs have adopted a limited and reactive management approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General is also critical of the current appeals process. His message, in simple terms, is that change is needed at the first level so that better decisions can be made in the first instance. This would mean fewer decisions being appealed. He also highlights the need for greater consistency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition accepts these points. They are matters which the coalition has been pointing out over and over again for a long time. A number of the problems highlighted by the Auditor-General have already been raised by the Opposition in one form or another and are addressed, at least in part, in our policy statement, which was released recently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This report comes at a time when the Parliament has been considering a Bill which proposes significant changes to the manner in which incapacity or death can be related to service. The second reading debate is scheduled for the last sitting week. The Bill is to be significantly amended by the Government after being savaged at a Senate committee hearing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not intend to debate the merits or otherwise of that Bill now, but this report obviously has important implications for any legislative action taken by the Government in relation to the standard of proof provisions in the Veterans' Entitlement Act. In this regard, the report demands careful examination and a response that is comprehensive, not piecemeal. This report has already been the subject of much discussion within the ex-service community and by others with a direct interest in the Veterans' Affairs portfolio. In the context of this report, a number of events in the past few months could be seen to be a softening-up process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 21 July, in the lead-up to the Budget, we saw a page 1 story in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> entitled, `Smoking and veterans: a $320m annual cost'. The article opened with the sentence:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian taxpayers are paying more than $320 million a year in compensation pensions to disabled war veterans or their widows as a result of illnesses or deaths caused by smoking.</PARA>
<PARA>This set the tone of the article, which implicitly suggested that veterans were benefiting unfairly from repatriation legislation provisions at the expense of taxpayers. John Stone followed up that story with some unfortunate and misguided comments. In a letter published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, I set out the obligations of the Commonwealth to properly compensate our veterans and stressed that these obligations do not diminish over time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The story had been on the boil for some time. The journalist had interviewed me on the smoking hypothesis issue well before the story appeared. The timing of the story fitted in nicely with a government framing a Budget and looking for portfolio savings. The story was founded on costings prepared for the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) on war widows and disability pension expenditure flowing from the smoking hypothesis, which were leaked to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> journalist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a further step in the softening-up process, the Bill to which I referred earlier was introduced last month. It was ostensibly designed to overcome a High Court decision which the Government claimed would mean open slather on veterans' benefits and a massive blow-out in pension costs. The Government's interpretation of the High Court decision and its subsequent legislation was blown out of the water at a Senate committee hearing. It was clear to everybody present at the hearing that the Bill was going much further than the Government claimed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question arises: to what extent was the looming presentation of this Auditor-General's report, of which the Department has seen working drafts all along the way, a factor in the content of that legislation? It may be that repatriation legislation needs to be improved, and the Auditor-General strongly suggests that it does, but if there is to be change, it must be after consultation with the ex-service community and it must be presented honestly and openly and not in an opportunistic way. Sadly, consultation with the veterans' community over the recent amendments to the Veterans' Entitlements Act was non-existent. This Department and this Government have been operating recently in a more and more complacent, indeed arrogant, manner with regard to veterans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that, as far as possible, change should occur on a bipartisan basis. In the foreword of this report, the Auditor-General notes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Disability and war widows' pensions are the principal means by which the nation has met its obligation to those who served to protect it in times of conflict.</PARA>
<PARA>This obligation must be clearly understood by anyone who seeks to effect change to our repatriation system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report is strongly critical of the administration of the compensation subprogram. It suggests that DVA management has not provided sufficient information and analysis to inform the Government and the Parliament of the results of the compensation program. There are also significant deficiencies in the Department's information systems and their use. Of greatest concern is that veterans are being let down by the inefficiencies and failings of the system. The Department is not well geared to handle the many complex issues arising from claims relating to psychiatric conditions. Rehabilitation facilities for veterans suffering post-traumatic stress disorder are almost non-existent. The present pension system is a disincentive to improvement. The report finds that more claims could be accepted within the current legislative framework if the Repatriation Commission accorded greater priority to an equity objective. What an incredible indictment of a government that has presided over this system for 10 years&mdash;a government that claims that social justice and equity are part of its platform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's policies are important in this regard. Our recently released policy statement identifies the needs of veterans with respect to the claims system as: easy access, confidence that their claims will be treated fairly, and a system that is as simple as possible. The policy further states that the coalition will reform the claims system so that it is fairer, better understood and more efficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the face of all the shortcomings in the compensation program and the associated legislation, the Auditor-General calls for a fundamental review of the operation of veterans' compensation arrangements. He notes that any examination of veterans' entitlements requires the support of the wider community and a bipartisan approach. He has suggested that the most appropriate forum for consideration of the issues would be a joint parliamentary committee. Unfortunately, with an election looming, this might not be possible for the present as such a committee would expire upon the calling of an election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that fundamental review is required and that as far as possible it does need to occur in a bipartisan environment. Veterans are dissatisfied with many aspects of the present compensation arrangements. They feel they have been short-changed by this Government. This alone should be reason for government action. The Government has also alarmed veterans and raised a number of important issues through the amendments proposed to overturn the Bushell decision in the High Court. These amendments, I believe, are simply a symptom of the greater problems highlighted by the Auditor-General in his report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report is, in many respects, a report card on the Minister and his administration of the portfolio. The Auditor-General has raised issues which should be of great concern to all with an interest in the good administration of the Veterans' Affairs portfolio. The Minister should be thinking already of what action can be taken to begin a process of review. I look forward to hearing the views of the ex-service community on the matters raised in the report. Of course, many of these things might have been dealt with long ago if the Government had not chosen to abolish the monitoring committee which was set up by former Senator Gietzelt with the 1986 legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that an ageing veteran population means new challenges in meeting the needs of veterans&mdash;and the coalition recognises this. It is clear that much more needs to be done in better meeting the needs of our younger veterans. The changing needs of the veteran population demand that we as policy-makers must be attuned to these challenges and willing to work constructively with the ex-service community on the way in which these challenges might be addressed. But they also demand a commitment to veterans and their dependants and recognition of the sacrifices they have made for our country. Our commitment does not diminish with the age of the veterans. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I was interrupted by the suspension of the sitting for lunch, I was busy comparing student organisations and the responsibility and obligations of enrolment at a university with the responsibilities and obligations of home owners when they purchase a home and bring themselves under the jurisdiction of a local council, and the requirement to pay for the broad range of services provided by the councils in various areas. This includes, to varying degrees, payment towards the political activities of a municipal council as well. These political activities vary from council to council, depending on how politicised those councils are. In many councils it includes a subscription to the nuclear free zone secretariat. This, in itself, is a very controversial measure in some regions, and one which the Australian Democrats certainly support. I raise that simply to provide, by way of example, the degree to which councils can engage in political issues, in the same way as student organisations engage in political questions as a part of the broad range of activities that they are engaged in. If people do not like the political activities that a local council or a student organisation is engaged in, then they have the democratic right to vote them out at the next election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberals have claimed today that universal membership of student organisations breaches individual freedom, even international treaties; however, in our view, this argument falls down in a number of areas. The point of choice for students is at enrolment. When a student decides to enrol at a university, the decision to join the student organisation should not be considered separate from this. According to the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, the freedom of choice lies in whether a person becomes a member of the university. This argument is sustained in legislation. Our legal system refuses to recognise any legal right to avoid membership and the requirement to pay a prescribed fee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Underlying these judgments is the notion that a university is a complex social institution of which student organisations are a vital part. Universities have the power to levy a fee due to their special statutory existence and by virtue of enrolling students who voluntarily bring themselves within the ambit of the university's authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one further point on the question of university autonomy which, as we know, is a key plank of the Opposition's education policy. It is our view that the coalition's policy on voluntary student unionism is highly intrusive on the question of university autonomy. The coalition would seek to directly intervene in the affairs of a university which is otherwise governed by the university by-laws; that is, its policy on voluntary student unionism is in direct contradiction with its stated policy of university autonomy. In our view, this contradiction in its own policy simply exposes the purely political nature of the coalition's policy in respect of student organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of membership of student organisations is clearly a political issue. It is a fundamental plank in the Opposition's platform, designed to reduce student resistance to aggressive and unfair education changes. The Australian Democrats support the rights of individual students and encourage the implementation of conscientious objection clauses into student organisation constitutions and university by-laws which would enable students to opt out of membership and pay the equivalent fee to a nominated source, usually a charity. Many institutions already have these clauses in their by-laws; in fact, in 1990 a survey revealed that 60 per cent of institutions already had these by-laws regarding opt out clauses in their constitutions, and therefore it is our belief, given that some two years has elapsed, that that figure is probably much higher at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In most cases the coalition has contradicted tenets of its own philosophy in its arguments against automatic membership and university autonomy. It claims that student organisations are unrepresentative, yet voluntary voting and a democratic election process mirror the coalition's own policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberals couch their political motivation in the guise of freedom of association and of individual rights. Their goal is to destroy student organisations through the introduction of voluntary student unionism, after which student organisations would not have the support base or the resources to survive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Students are faced with an electoral Hobson's choice at the next election. They have a choice between full fees, vouchers and restricted Austudy as part of the Opposition's policy and the Government's mortgage-type fees for postgraduate and non-award courses, HECS hikes and other loan schemes. More than ever before students need a strong support base to protect their interests. More than ever they need effective student organisations to protect their interests and services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats remain the only political party willing to protect an accessible and equitable public education system. To this extent, we reiterate our concern and support for the fact that student organisations play a vitally important role in the total fabric of university life. Students are obligated to become members when they decide to enrol in a university and bring themselves under the ambit of a university culture. We will continue to fight for a fairer and open education system for all Australians. I commend these Bills to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was very interested in the rather tortuous logic of Senator Sowada. I will address the question of student unionism in a few minutes, when I will come back to those comments. We are discussing a number of Bills in this debate. I wish to express my disgust that we have five or six Bills thrown together in one cognate debate. These issues are important enough, as we are dealing with universities, school students and a whole range of other issues in Australian education. Each of these matters really deserves full debate in its own right. Here we are, towards the end of the session for the year, being forced to consider all of these Bills together.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no time for me to deal adequately with the huge number of Bills that are before us within this cognate debate. I wish to focus my remarks on the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992. The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 to provide grants of assistance to States and universities. The measures in this Bill that relate to the funding of higher education are largely drawn directly from the ideas of the Opposition's Fightback package. Therefore, it is natural for us to applaud this because the Government, with its ideas on higher education, obviously recognises that it has failed dismally. In particular, this has been shown by the fact that the national unified system created by Mr Dawkins is now largely discredited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At last, the Government has found it necessary to accept the coalition's policies. I will be dealing with a number of these as shown in the Bill. One of the most important measures in this Bill rolls capital funding into recurrent funding. The coalition has long been in favour of doing this and it should have been done some time ago. The advantage of this move is that it allows institutions to plan their own capital developments. This reduces their dependence on political discretion to decide whether they receive those capital funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also increases the number of postgraduate research awards by 200. Again, this is a move that the Opposition has advocated in the Fightback package. However, the Opposition plans to go further and increase the stipend under these awards by $2,000. By doing this we will attract the very best students into the postgraduate awards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently, the very best students seek out awards overseas. They do this because they are rewarded better elsewhere. Research in Australia therefore has not had the chance to reach its full potential. By increasing the number and the amount of those awards, as we propose doing under Fightback, there will be the opportunity for this to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another measure which I am pleased to see the Government introducing is the provision of direct grants to institutions. This is an excellent idea because it will facilitate the implementation of the Opposition's national education award system when we are in government after the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most important measures implemented by this Bill is the Government's open learning initiative. Clearly, this is an initiative which the Government does not fully understand. This ignorance of the way in which open learning works was demonstrated by the statement made by Mr Dawkins when he announced the funding of the OLI in the August Budget. Mr Dawkins claimed that the Government's open learning initiative would make higher education available to everyone in Australia who had a television set and a letterbox. This is truly nonsense; it is an absurd statement. Senator Sowada has already indicated that she thinks it is an absurd statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The money that the Government is providing for the OLI is not enough to fund quality higher education. The Government is proposing simply to fund the open learning initiative at a cost per student per course equivalent to the HECS rate. It then assumes that the OLI will be self-funding. Given that the cost per student per course is closer to $7,000 for a less complex, low resource degree such as arts or economics, quality is obviously not a high priority for this Government&mdash;if the OLI scheme is anything to go by. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has failed to adequately explain which services will not be provided in the OLI course and which services, such as tutorials and marking of assignments, will have to be paid for by the students enrolled. The open learning initiative, as proposed by the Government, is completely dominated by one university&mdash;that being Monash University&mdash;and the five distance education centres established by our universities around the country over the last 10 years are in serious danger of being left out in the cold through inappropriate government policies. This could be a very exciting area of growth in education, but the Government, by coming in with this very centralised approach of focusing the initiative on one institution, will destroy something that has been developing very well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Probably the most disturbing aspect of the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 2) is that it contains a measure to legislate for compulsory student unionism. I found Senator Sowada's use of logic in this matter intriguing. She mentioned that we work for autonomy and that that is the broad direction of our policy. That is true. I would have thought that voluntary student unionism was something that moves us very much down that line. I think that all students should be given the opportunity to become members of a union, just as they should be given that opportunity in other areas of activity in our economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was a PhD student about 10 years ago, and every year I had to pay into a student union fund. I objected to doing this. I was told, `If you don't pay into this fund, we will not enrol you'. I said, `If you put it that way, all right, I'll do it'. It was compulsory. Part of my money that went into the fund went overseas to support the PLO, which was part of the student organisation's initiative at that time. I objected very much to my money being used in that way, but I was compelled to do it. People should not be compelled to contribute to such causes or to the funding of these bodies if they do not want to. Therefore, we support the voluntary student unionism provision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems we have with the way student union funds are used is that there is a very long history of funds not being used particularly wisely. For example, the Tasmanian branch of the National Union of Students has recently been rocked by charges of alleged misappropriation of funds. It is now subject to criminal proceedings. It has been claimed that cheques were written out of union funds for personal use by a member of the union executive and his friends. They were not accountable and there were no obvious internal control procedures followed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many other cases. One of the many other cases is the NUS women's office conference in September which had an authorised budget of $6,000. The convener overspent by $40,000 because it was decided arbitrarily to subsidise the four days of accommodation, food and airfares for the 100 delegates to the conference, even though it was clear that delegates were supposed to pay their own way. The long, documented list of the abuse of student funds by student unions is extensive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taxpayers' money is badly needed in other areas of higher education. We need to create extra places for qualified students, we need to provide infrastructure for funding and research and we need to create a more internationally competitive work force. All of these things require money, and the money that is going to higher education should be used responsibly. By adopting some of the Fightback education policies, this Bill very clearly shows the people of Australia that this Government has run out of ideas in dealing with higher education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it is thrown out of office after the next election, this Labor Government will have left a sorry legacy. It has consistently introduced measures that have led to mediocrity rather than international standards of excellence. It has created a situation where this year 50,000 Australian students will miss out on a place in universities. It has created a bureaucratic nightmare in higher education with destructive intervention in the internal affairs of what should be autonomous institutions. It is very obvious that the Government has failed this sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to rejuvenate the higher education sector by immediately implementing the policies outlined in the Fightback document. If the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) had gone to an election earlier than he plans, we would have an opportunity to bring these policies in as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, we are going to have to wait probably until the middle of next year. When we are in government, we will restore university autonomy and thereby give freedom to universities to create extra places to meet increased demand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's basic philosophy for education is that individuals and institutions should have the freedom to choose their own futures within very broad limitations. With freedom comes responsibility, including financial responsibility. Given that responsibility, institutions should be independent of government control or interference as far as possible. The Opposition will restore independence to universities and support increases in basic research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Links with industry will be encouraged in a way which will enhance research opportunities rather than through the disruptive and ad hoc policies pursued by Labor. We will establish an effective student market for higher education by basing the recurrent funding of universities on a system of national education awards given to students on the basis of merit and scholarship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition will restore universities' essential freedom to set their own courses and end the process of bureaucratically approved profiles. We will also give universities the freedom to offer additional places to Australian undergraduates beyond the government places and on their own terms. Through these innovative measures we will restore autonomy to universities and create a university system of world class standard, providing the diversity of opportunity that is required to meet the diversity of student need. Under the additional $3 billion that we are spending on education over the next seven years, there will be some hope for creating the clever country rather than the rather pale shadow that has been the sorry legacy of 10 years of ALP rule in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will confine my remarks to the implementation of clause 66 of the Higher Education Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992 and the Opposition's strong opposition to it. Senator Sowada and my colleague Senator Tierney have referred to the issue of voluntary student unionism. Clause 66 basically guarantees to student bodies or unions&mdash;or guilds as they are called in some States&mdash;funding from the Commonwealth or, more importantly, from the back pockets of Australian taxpayers, in the event that a State government in its wisdom decides to ensure that no campus or administration is able to impose upon students a compulsory levy, or a compulsory union due as it should more accurately be described.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will spend some time on this matter because I want to try to convince Senator Sowada and the Australian Democrats that what they are doing is not only very bad for the rights of individual students, for institutions and for the guilds, but also it is very bad for Australian taxpayers. The Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin), in his second reading speech, used an argument that the justification for clause 66&mdash;that is, taking taxpayers' money and giving it to student unions in the event that membership of those unions is made non-compulsory&mdash;was that States do not have the right to interfere with the rights of institutions. Senator Sowada reinforced that point. As Senator Tierney said, perhaps unkindly, she was using tortured logic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I want to put another piece of logic to Senator Sowada, to the Democrats and to the Government on behalf of the Opposition. In the choice of the rights of an institution and the rights of individual Australians and students, we should always choose the rights of the individual. Institutions, universities or colleges have the rights of an inanimate object&mdash;a bunch of buildings, a few ovals and some gardens&mdash;and, of course, the history and culture that goes with those institutions. Those institutions may have some rights, but when it comes to Australian politicians, and particularly senators, choosing between the rights and autonomy of an institution and the decisions made by the institution, by its governing bodies and by its administrators, and the rights of individual young Australians, they should always choose those young Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By imposing a compulsory payment of a student union due, we say to that student, `You have a great choice'. As Senator Tierney said, `You either pay that student union due or you don't come and study here and you don't get your degree'. It is the same sort of choice that the Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook, mentioned today. He quite properly implied that to put a contract in front of a person and say, `You have a choice of whether to sign it or not' under the duress of losing his job, is wrong. If we apply that sort of duress to students by forcing them to either pay a student union due or not, the choice is only theirs to the extent that if they do not want to pay it, they do not have the opportunity to further their education, to study at that university and to get a degree or a diploma. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fundamentally, we have always thought that was wrong in principle. It is a principle which I have fought for years of my life. It is a principle that dedicated young Australians, particularly in the Australian Liberal Students Federation and the Liberal clubs around Australia, have fought for many years. It is a principle that has taken those young, particularly Liberal, students years to put into senior Party policy. It is a principle that has not been supported in the past by Liberal State governments. A former State Liberal Government in Western Australia failed to introduce voluntary student unionism. That former State Liberal Government stands condemned for not introducing it. The Greiner Liberal Government in New South Wales also failed to implement that reform. I am proud to be a member of a coalition that has voluntary student unionism in its policy platform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to pass to the important principle that I hope the Democrats will turn their minds to: we are really creating a massive featherbed for student unions by the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth taxpayer basically saying, `It does not matter what happens to your organisation, it does not matter how successful you are or how well you run that organisation, we will underwrite your expenses'. Problems have occurred with NUS lately. There has been the scandal in Tasmania where I believe the NUS President has admitted to charges of stealing from the organisation and the scandal associated with the funding of the recent national women students conference which blew its budget by $40,000. These are the sorts of scandals that will happen where there is this massive featherbedding, underwriting and lack of accountability. That occurs where there is compulsory funding, which we have at the moment and, as Senator Sowada quite rightly said, where there is a voluntary voting system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Sowada, and anyone else who has been involved in campus, knows full well that involvement in the political process on campus is far less than desirable. There is usually a small bunch of activist Far Left socialists, a bunch of activist Far Right Australian Liberal students and a small handful of Democrats, Greens and all sorts of people in between. I respect each one of those groups, because people who get involved in the political process anywhere in this country, particularly on campus, do a great service to this nation and often provide future material that sooner or later ends up in this Parliament. That may or may not be a good thing and I will not reflect on that for too long. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I am trying to make is that where we have this featherbedding created by ensuring a source of funding to an organisation, without that organisation having to fight for that funding and go out and convince people that it is a good idea to hand over money to that particular organisation, then of course it will not be careful about how it spends that money. A result of the compulsion that has applied at so many campuses across Australia is that the fees have been going up and up, compulsorily imposed with the imprimatur, sanction and legislative force of State governments. I am told that the fees across some campuses now are upwards of $300 and $400&mdash;an enormous amount of money for a student to find. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In clause 66, we do not only have featherbedding by creating compulsion and denying individual people's rights to choose whether or not they want to join a union. We now have this Federal Government taking from the Australian taxpayer&mdash;and mark my words; it will&mdash;the money to ensure that no matter what happens with those unions, they will always be funded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us take, for example, the University of Western Australia which, I believe, raised in the vicinity of $1.5m from compulsorily collected fees in the last financial year. It is not too hypothetical to suggest that if voluntary student unionism applied as it should on Australian campuses, we could have a union dominated by mad reactionary students of either the Right or the Left. It has happened from time to time. I will not be partisan about it; there could be mad reactionary students from either the Right or the Left dominating that union. We could end up with a union membership of a president in a full time paid position, a secretary and a couple of others. There could be four or five members of that union, with this Commonwealth Government underwriting that union to the tune of $1 1/2m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is probably taking it to the extreme, and I do not seek to enforce my argument with an extreme example, but the point I am making will naturally occur. There will be student organisations that are representative to the extent, as Senator Sowada and I agree, that they are controlled by activists of the Left, the Right or her Party, but who are not usually representative of the vast bulk of the student body. They will get control of these organisations and will no longer have to appeal to the broader student body when recruiting their membership and, indeed, when representing the will of the student body. The Commonwealth Government will reach into the back pockets of the long-suffering taxpayers of Australia and say to the unions, `Regardless of what you do, we will guarantee that funding'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill does not just say, `We will give the assistance required', or `replace the amount of money you would have collected under compulsory student unionism'. The Bill states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) the institution will pay each amount of that financial assistance received by it to the student organisation concerned without undue delay; and . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Just to make sure the institution does not pocket the money and not give it to the union, the Bill states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) the institution will give to the Minister, not later than 30 June next following that year, a statement by a qualified auditor, in an appropriate form, as to the amounts so paid to the organisation.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, `We will give the institution the money. We will ensure that it is paid to the organisation and just because we do not trust the institution, we will make sure an auditor gives you the money'. The point that I have made in a long and roundabout way is that if the Government wants student unions&mdash;and the Liberal Party is not opposed to student unions; the Australian Liberal Students Federation is not opposed to student unions&mdash;to be a positive force on campus, to create a political outlet, to continue the culture of political activism on campus, then it must ensure that those unions are representative of the student body, that they fight for their survival and for membership and that they fight for the interests of the students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I make, and I hope that I have convinced Senator Sowada of this, is that if the Government featherbeds these unions by ensuring that their funding is compulsory, and then further featherbeds them by ensuring that if that funding is not made compulsory it is underwritten by the Australian taxpayer, then it will ensure that that goal of student unionism is not achieved. Indeed, all that will achieve is unions that are out of touch and unrepresentative of the student body, just as we have seen in the last few days with the National Union of Students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will conclude by saying that the ultimate cost of this legislation to the Australian taxpayer could be upwards of $40m, depending, of course, on the rate at which campuses move to voluntary student unionism. I am sure that I am joined by all of my colleagues on this side of the chamber who wish the Opposition in Western Australia, led by Richard Court and Hendy Cowan, great luck at the next State election. We look forward to Richard Court becoming the Premier of that State and introducing voluntary student unionism as one of his first Acts of parliament, something that his father before him failed to do. </PARA>

This should give some indication that Bourke is a town that is struggling to overcome a number of problems that are fairly well publicised and, I think, overemphasised by the media. But it is a town that I like very much. It is a community that is struggling to overcome its problems and one which has now found that its schools have been struck off the list for this form of assistance.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the Bourke schools to take their kids on a trip to McDonalds, which is a big treat for a lot of kids, would involve a 400-kilometre trip both ways.

I cannot think of too many people who could not say that they had not actually attained some school education, but it is no guide or assistance in judging just how good the literacy and numeracy skills are of the parents in that town.

We do not have any powers in this matter and it is of grave concern to me that the State of New South Wales can exclude schools such as Bourke Public School and Bourke Primary School from such a very important program in an area that is disadvantaged and which lives up to that name.

The best way to ensure that is to allow people an opportunity to associate or dissociate.

I think that provision is to be found in the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Act 1984. But, interestingly, it states that universities are not able and are not allowed, autonomously, to collect fees payable to the relevant institution during the time of enrolment or applying for enrolment.

Senator Crichton-Browne argues trenchantly from his particular political philosophy one view and ignores some of the difficulties with the Opposition's approach to the same matter.

It is a popular myth that the quality of school education today is not a patch on what it used to be years ago. The fact is that the quality of schools and teaching has improved out of sight and is continuing to improve, as is acknowledged by most parents who take an interest in schools.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was a member of the Catholic Education Council in the Northern Territory for some years and I have had active participation in COGSO.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Educational reform in this country is complex and requires extensive consultation with all concerned. We are not interested in going down the path of the Kennett Government in abolishing school communities with little warning and imposing change without any consultation. At the historic meeting in Tasmania in 1989 the Australian Education Council agreed to develop a national curriculum framework for Australian schools. That decision&mdash;the Hobart declaration on schooling&mdash;started a process which will see the development of high quality curriculum materials through to the next century. To this end, over the past four years this Government has been working together with State governments and non-government education authorities to develop national curriculum frameworks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should say at the outset that there is nothing compulsory about this exercise. We are not in a position, even if we wanted to be&mdash;which we do not&mdash;to impose a central curriculum on Australian schools. National curriculum development is in every sense a cooperative endeavour. Participation in its development and the use of the final product are entirely voluntary at state system and even at school level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of the reform agenda, the Federal Government has also established a national project on the quality of teaching and learning to promote the delivery of quality teaching to our school students and to enhance the status of the teaching profession in the eyes of the community. The other key part of the reform agenda lies in the post-compulsory area. The Mayer committee report on key competencies, released on 23 November 1992, outlines a plan for action which will enable all of our young people to acquire essential employment related key competencies which will allow them to participate effectively in the work force. The States have already agreed to further collaborative work with the Commonwealth in this significant area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the schools sector, the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 1992 sets the framework for continuing to improve the quality and cost effectiveness of Australian schooling. Under our new schools funding policies, the only limitations on growth in the non-government sector result from the application of principles of sound educational planning. These principles, represented by the new schools policy, require new non-government schools to be established in areas where there are sufficient potential students to justify a new school. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The steady increase in funded enrolments in non-government schools over the last decade makes an absolute mockery of the accusation levelled by our opponents that the new schools policy is used to restrict growth in non-government schools. Between 1980 and 1991 enrolment in non-government schools grew by 190,000 students, or 29 per cent. The non-government system's share of the total school population increased from 22 per cent in 1980 to 28 per cent in 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new schools policy is first and foremost a policy to enhance planned educational provision and, as such, enjoys widespread support among non-government schools. I can well understand why some non-government schools are horrified by proposals in the Fightback document to abolish the new schools policy and provide Federal funding to every new or expanding non-government school, regardless of where it proposes to set up. Under such a strategy, existing non-government schools would have no protection from rival schools in receipt of Federal funding opening up in the same neighbourhood. But this Government has also addressed a number of issues which do not figure in the Opposition's rhetoric&mdash;issues such as equity, stability and security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides the framework for the establishment of a national equity program for schools which will focus on improved outcomes for students facing educational disadvantage and provide greater flexibility for education systems in their  use of these funds. In return, we are asking the States to provide a range of data on educational outcomes for these students. These two Bills provide ongoing stability and security for all Australian schools. This security and stability in funding is something that both government and non-government schools have come to expect and enjoy under this Federal Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recognising that all schools need to plan ahead, we announced school funding levels eight years in advance, the first four years of which are guaranteed in legislation. These Bills detail the funding levels for both government and non-government schools through the years 1993 to 1996. This Government would like to see the continuation, through to the year 2000, of the stability and security which have characterised funding over the past eight years. We are genuinely concerned that the effective collapse of needs based funding advocated by our opponents will reopen the state aid debate and threaten the viability of the whole non-government sector. For its part, the Federal Government will continue to defend the dual system of education which recognises the right of parents to choose schools which reflect their values and which funds all non-government schools on the basis of need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the higher education sector, this Bill is an important manifestation of this Government's commitment to higher education.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Teague acknowledged the level of resources provided for higher education but questioned whether this represented value for money and cast doubt on the quality of the provision. This Bill includes the provision of $76m each year from 1994 to be allocated amongst universities which demonstrate effective performance in quality management. These funds were part of a package of initiatives announced by the Government in 1991 to enhance and improve quality in higher education, including the establishment of a committee for the advancement of university teaching. An additional $4m is being allocated in 1993 to fund successful applications for teaching development grants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Teague also questioned the quality of the open learning initiative. Senator Tierney, on earlier occasions, has called the open learning initiative `a cheap political gimmick'. In fact, open learning is a quality response to a growing need for more flexible access and to provision of tertiary education at a time of continuing strong demand. The Government is providing substantial support, to the tune of $47m, to ensure that this initiative is put on a solid financial and educational footing. The Government has decided to further improve access to open learning by offering a deferred payment arrangement to some students, although details of this arrangement have yet to be determined. I was pleased to note the Australian Democrats' support for this approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Sowada did, however, sound a warning note about overseas students and the need to ensure that quality of provision is maintained, with adequate grievance procedures for individual students. This Government recognises that quality in education is crucial to Australia's participation in international education. In addition to the quality measures I have mentioned, specific measures have been taken to ensure that our standing is maintained in international education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While most international educational activity must be and is carried out by the institutions, the government plays a coordinating and supporting role. The introduction of the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Act 1991 helped stabilise the industry by providing both financial regulation and quality assurance for international students in Australian institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the most serious accusation levelled by the Opposition is that the proposed HEFA amendment to protect financial support for student representative organisations is an attack on the civil liberties of the Australian higher education students. This Government considers that it is an important feature of university autonomy that higher education institutions should be able to make their own decisions about the imposition of fees for student services and amenities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government objects to proposals to interfere with that autonomy. The Opposition would prevent institutions from insisting on students paying a student union fee, thus depriving universities of some $200m in revenue and, unless the Commonwealth meets the funding shortfall, depriving students of a range of services, such as counselling, health, sport, careers advice and amenities. I am pleased to note the Democrats' support for this amendment and their recognition of the essential services that are provided by student unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, the Opposition would be quite happy to allow universities to charge any other fees they wish. A fee for service provided by a university itself would be acceptable to the Opposition but an identical fee for an identical service provided by a student organisation would not. The Opposition's real aim&mdash;an obvious aim, as evidenced by the contributions to the debate; that is, the political destruction of student representative organisations&mdash;is all too apparent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This brings me to the major problem with the Opposition's higher education policy&mdash;the impact of fees in conjunction with its voucher scheme. Those policies would fail to have any significant impact on the various problems mentioned in the Opposition's amendment. In particular, there could be no significant impact on unmet demand. How many unsuccessful applicants could afford places in a university? Instead, Opposition policies would make access to higher education a matter of ability to pay rather than ability to succeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill provides $241m of Commonwealth assistance to State, Territory, non-government and independent Aboriginal education providers over the 1993-95 triennium. While a relatively small amount of money compared with the other Bills that are here today, it is important to note that this assistance provides the underpinning for the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy&mdash;a key agreement between all governments to improve access to, and participation in, education by the indigenous people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know from conversations that I had with Geoff Spring, the then Secretary of the Department of Education in the Northern Territory who I think has gone on to higher things in Victoria, how much the Northern Territory Department of Education valued the completion of this national policy on Aboriginal education.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Clause 66 should be deleted from the Bill, and the remainder of the Bill be adopted. The principle involved is that this chamber ought to ensure that there is freedom of association in Australia, including amongst students at universities. In the case of student unions, we have never seen legislation such as is represented by clause 66. It directly transgresses the principle of freedom of association, and the Liberal and National parties oppose it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I referred briefly to this in my contribution to the second reading debate, as did my colleagues Senator Tierney, Senator Campbell and Senator Crichton-Browne. As Senator Collins said, we are aware that there is a difference of view in this matter. I do not accept the Minister's aspersion that the Liberal and National parties are doing this only for pragmatic political reasons, such as to deny funds to left wing student unions that would be using their resources politically against my parties. I genuinely believe in the principle that, as we profess in all of our human rights statements, and as we profess in both the major Party platforms and I think the Democrats do as well, we should have this kind of freedom of association. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I believe that it is the right of State parliaments to legislate for freedom of association in student unions, and by taking this clause 66 measure we are rejecting that right. In practice, it will give power to the Minister in the Commonwealth to override any decision made by a State parliament, such as is the case pending in New South Wales and as may be the case, given the policies of the Liberal and National parties, in the other States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, I refer to those who would put the argument that a number of amenities are provided in universities which depend upon the student union fee. There is a way around this and that is to divide those activities supported by student union fees at the moment which are universal or of an amenity kind, from those that are controversial and where there can be conscientious objection. I think it would be without offence to at least the majority of Australians that the amenities be provided. But it is against the consciences of the majority of Australians to be forced to pay moneys for controversial political activities, or to support publications which may be quite contrary to the moral views of some of the students so cajoled into joining and paying such money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this is the major way to answer those who raise that argument about our sporting associations, drama associations, places of meeting, even indeed the provision of facilities such as toilets. I remember that at the University of Adelaide the principal toilets used by students were, in fact, in the student union. This is a facility which is only allowed to be kept open, if you like, by union fees. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I say to Senator Tate that such facilities must be available to students&mdash;indeed, to the whole community of persons at the university. There are ways then of sensibly overcoming this problem. I acknowledge that there are those who would argue that drama and sport ought to be entirely voluntary and that the university ought not to require a payment with respect to sport and drama. I happen not to be of that view. The area that I oppose&mdash;that is, in addition to a facilities fee&mdash;is that of the controversial, political and other activities of such a student association.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth matter I wish to refer to is the blatant hypocrisy of the Government. The Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services, Mr Baldwin, in the second reading speech argued that he was actually protecting the university from the intrusion of the State government. I must move on quickly as I see the clock is moving towards 7.30 p.m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to note and remind the Senate that on 18 December 1990&mdash;two years ago&mdash;a similar measure was initiated by this Government, and it was rejected by the Senate by one vote. I wish to appeal very briefly to those who voted with me and the Liberal and National parties at that time. Senator Harradine, Senator Kernot and Senator Lees had the courage of their convictions and voted for the motion that I moved, which was successful and which saw the end of the Government proposal at that time. Senator Sowada, who is in the chamber, is new; she was not here then; Senator Chamarette, too, is new and was not here then. I appeal to all those I have named especially to vote with the Liberal and National parties on the amendment I have just proposed to ensure that we have freedom of association. Indeed, I appeal to all honourable senators to do so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government will be strongly opposing this amendment. Senator Teague has left out some important matters, one of which, of course, is that the major function of student unions is not to provide controversial student activity&mdash;and they do not. They, in fact, provide about $200m worth of services to students across Australia, in terms of such things as counselling and child care&mdash;and, of course, I am personally familiar with the operation of these student unions. If this amendment were carried here in the Committees, those activities would have to be either abandoned or replaced by additional calls on the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But as I have pointed out&mdash;and it does not have to be gone over again in any detail&mdash;those opposite have a very convenient policy on all of this. They have no difficulty with the universities charging any fees they like. In fact, that is their policy. They put themselves in the situation where it is okay for a university to levy a fee to provide a service at a particular price, but it is not okay for a student union to do the same. This would be a terrible disruption to invaluable services that are provided by these organisations. The Government strongly opposes this amendment. </PARA>

In so doing, I would simply like to respond to some of the issues that were raised by speakers on the Opposition side during the second reading debate on the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 2). It has been suggested by some that this is an attack on freedom of association. But what the Opposition has failed to mention is that over 60 per cent of tertiary institutions already have conscientious objection clauses in their by-laws&mdash;that is, some form of opt-out clause which will enable students, if they have an objection to joining a student union, to opt out of membership.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not detain the Senate for more than a few minutes.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an important date in Australia's history, and particularly in the history of the Australian Labor Party. I hasten to assure the Senate that I will not go into a long dissertation of memoirs of that election night or of the period of the Whitlam Government. I will not be accused of wallowing in the past. But it is a significant day that deserves a brief mention so that such an anniversary does not pass unmarked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The place of politics in Australian life made a quantum leap at that election. It began for so many people a period of hope and pride in Australia, the development of open government and all sorts of policies of which Australia can be proud. Of course, the truth of that period is somewhere between the rosy view that Gough Whitlam himself would take and the highly critical view that his and his Government's detractors would take. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just want to place on record my pride in having been part of that era which established so much and set in train other policies which were implemented later. In current days, as this twentieth anniversary is recognised, various commentaries have made a comparison with the Kennett Government in Victoria. People are saying that Mr Kennett is moving just as swiftly as Mr Whitlam did in December 1972. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The significant difference is that, in the case of the Whitlam Labor Government in December 1972, it was a matter of implementing the Australian Labor Party's program as clearly enunciated in the election campaign and for many months before that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) and (2) A United Nations employee of Burmese nationality and a Norwegian journalist were killed in southern Sudan in late September. The bodies of two other aid workers, a Kenyan man and a Filipina woman, kidnapped at the same time, were found later. The Kenyan worked for UNICEF and the Filipina was a nurse with the non-government organisation (NGO) Interaid. The Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) claimed that a breakaway faction was responsible for the deaths but the UN declared that it held the SPLA in general responsible. It was the first time aid workers had been killed by the rebels in southern Sudan since 1987. The four died of gunshot wounds but the UN reported that they had not been caught in crossfire as the SPLA had claimed. The UN's Operation Lifeline Sudan suspended relief efforts in the area involved after the bodies were found.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The four foreigners were killed at the time of the defection of a senior commander of the Torit faction led by John Garang. The defector, William Nyuon, had formed a third splinter group (apart from Torit and Nasir). The unofficial SPLA representative in Cairo told our Embassy there that Nyuon's splinter group was responsible for the executions. According to the representative, Nyuon split from Torit with the intention of mounting a coup d'etat against Garang. When the coup failed, Nyuon and his followers went to a UN camp where they demanded food. The two UN officials on duty explained to the group that the food was available only for southern Sudanese civilians whose livelihoods had been destroyed during the war. Nyuon ordered his bodyguards to shoot the two officials. The two witnesses to the shootings were kidnapped and later killed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The latest information from our High Commission in Nairobi is that responsibility for the deaths has not yet been formally established, with the Torit and Nyuon factions blaming each other.

The team interviewed UN and NGO personnel as well as representatives of the various factions of the SPLA. The report has been submitted to the Secretary-General but has not yet been released.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) (a) The Australian Government deplores the killings and shares the serious concerns of the international community for the innocent people affected by the civil war in Sudan. We have made representations to the Government of Sudan concerning the human rights situation, in particular, the grave human rights crisis in Juba, southern Sudan. Following the receipt of a report from Amnesty International in September on the human rights situation in Juba, our Embassy in Cairo made representations to the Sudanese Government, conveying the Australian Government's deep concern over the allegations. The Sudanese Government has not yet responded to our representations. I also raised Australia's concerns about human rights abuses, including detention without trial and the displacement of people from their homes, when I met the Sudanese Ambassador to Australia (resident in Kuala Lumpur) in May.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) Although Australia has not made any representations on the Sudanese conflict in the United Nations, we have asked our missions in New York and Geneva to provide information on the international community's reaction to the increasingly serious situation in Sudan, and what plans are underway to prevent it escalating further. In this context the United Nations Under-Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs, Mr Jan Eliason, visited Sudan in mid-September to review humanitarian affairs there. Following his discussions with the Sudanese Government, 21 new air corridors for relief supplies have been agreed upon. The number of non-government organisations operating in Sudan has also been increased from 26 to 46.

Rather it entails the continuing right of all peoples and individuals within each state to participate fully in the political process by which they are governed.
