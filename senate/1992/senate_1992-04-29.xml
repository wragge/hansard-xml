<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XG4">Senator GILES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These regulations were made consequent upon the passing of the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill 1991, which implemented recommendations in Professor Peter Baume's report on the future of drug evaluation in Australia. The Committee's concerns relate, firstly, to discretions conferred upon a public official with no apparent right of external review of their merits, even though they appear to be of considerable commercial importance. In addition, public officials are not required to make a decision in respect of certain matters until 12 months have elapsed. Also, the Committee is concerned about possible limits on compensation for members of the public who suffer loss because public officials do not comply with legislative requirements. As usual, I seek leave to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> a statement of the matters raised by the Committee with the Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The statement read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">THERAPEUTIC GOODS REGULATIONS  (AMENDMENT)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">STATUTORY RULES 1992 NO.19</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 is intended to establish and maintain a national system of controls relating to the quality, safety, efficiency and availability of therapeutic goods used in Australia or exported from Australia. The Therapeutic Goods Amendment Act 1991 amended that principal Act to give effect to recommendations made by Professor Peter Baume's Report on the Future of Drug Evaluation in Australia, with the present Regulations made as a consequence of those amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two regulations confer important discretions on the Secretary with no indication whether they are subject to external independent review of their merits. In this context the principal Therapeutic Goods Regulations provide generally satisfactory review procedures, some of which were included to implement earlier undertakings given to the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Also, the Regulations provide for public officials to complete certain processes only within 175 and 255 working days. While this is some protection for the public, those periods appear to be some nine calendar months and one calendar year respectively. The Committee wishes to ensure that these periods are not excessive and are in accordance with Professor Baume's Report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, there may be a breach of the personal liberties of members of the public affected by the Regulations. Thus, even if public officials fail to meet what appear to be generous time limits within which to make a decision, neither the Commonwealth, the Secretary nor a delegate are liable for any loss which arises from the failure. Admittedly, in respect of one of the two time limits, the fee is reduced by 25 per cent if the limit is not met. However, this may not be adequate compensation. In the case of the other time limit there is no such provision. The Committee is concerned at this apparent limit on compensation for damage suffered because officials do not comply with the requirements of Commonwealth legislation.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the 1990 amendments to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer: Australia will then be able to ratify the amendments to the Protocol. The legislation will also strengthen the existing provisions of the Ozone Protection Act 1989 so that the manufacture and import of substances that destroy the protective shield of ozone in the stratosphere can be phased out in accordance with Australia's National Strategy for Ozone Protection: a strategy which is three years ahead of the Protocol in its current form.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The latest scientific research from the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organisation has revealed for the first time ever, significant year round ozone losses in all areas of the world, other than the tropics.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is now very strong scientific evidence that various chemicals such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), halons, methyl chloroform and carbon tetrachloride are causing ozone destruction at a far greater rate than occurs through natural processes. Results of NASA experiments, announced recently, confirm the relationship between ozone depletion and these chemicals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senators will be aware that CFCs are used in refrigeration and air conditioning, as solvents to degrease metal parts, to clean electronic circuit boards and as blowing agents in the manufacture of plastic foams. Methyl chloroform and carbon tetrachloride are also used as cleaning solvents. Halons are used in fire fighting equipment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most Australians will be aware that we rely on a small layer of ozone in the stratosphere to filter out harmful ultraviolet radiation. Excessive ultraviolet radiation has the potential to cause major health problems to humans and animals and severely damage crops and natural ecosystems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consequently, if the ozone loss is sustained, our lifestyles and the environment around us will be severely affected. The incidence of non-melanoma skin cancer in Australia is already the highest recorded per capita for any cancer in any population in the world. A sustained 10% decrease in ozone is predicted to increase skin cancer by twenty six percent. The UNEP Scientific Assessment Panel predicts that worldwide, we could be looking at an increase in excess of 300,000 cases per year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not only suncream but sun-glasses will become a permanent way of life for the next thirty years for most Australians. A sustained 10% global decrease in ozone is predicted to result in between 1.6 and 1.75 million additional cases of eye cataracts per year worldwide.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also predicted that there will be an increase in the incidence or severity of infectious diseases, as ultraviolet radiation suppresses our immune system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Apart from this potential human tragedy, the financial burden of additional health costs could amount to billions of dollars world-wide. The Department has recently commissioned a joint study by the University of Wollongong and the CSIRO to estimate the likely impacts of these health costs to the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other effects of increased ultraviolet radiation include negative impacts on agriculture, forestry and natural ecosystems including the aquatic ecosystem. Pollution in the lower atmosphere is expected to increase and products made from wood and plastic will degrade more rapidly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The world will not be able to avoid this scenario unless Governments make a strong commitment to ozone protection. However, the full impacts of increased ultraviolet radiation due to ozone depletion need not occur if the phase-out targets in the Protocol are met and if countries advance these targets wherever possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is recognised as a world leader in ozone protection. Australia's action in implementing the Protocol has been coordinated by the Australia and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council (ANZECC) through the Strategy for Ozone Protection, which was released in 1989. The Strategy already provides a basis for phasing out the production and import of CFCs completely by the end of 1997 and is now being reviewed by ANZECC in the light of Australia's achievements to date and recent scientific assessments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Initially, in 1989, there was resistance by some industry&mdash;sectors to the early phase out targets. With encouragement from ANZECC, Australia, which was a very high per capita user, has already reduced CFC consumption to less than 50% of 1986 quantities. Under our present strategies, by the end of 1995, CFC consumption is likely to have been reduced to about 10% of 1986 quantities, which would be mainly for certain essential uses and the servicing of existing equipment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some industries such as the aerosol industry, have taken a very responsible attitude and have almost completely eliminated the use of CFCs. Others have workable strategies in place or are in the process of developing their plans. Unfortunately one or two sectors remain relatively unmoved. It is imperative that all users of ozone depletion substances complete their planning for a change-over to transitional&mdash;substances or ozone benign technologies. One thing is certain, the phase-out of ozone depleting substances will proceed. It is inevitable that those who do not plan ahead will face higher costs as the phase-out dates become closer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's decision to phase out CFCs in advance of the 1990 Protocol requirements has been vindicated by the recent scientific assessments. International pressures is now mounting for the next review of the Protocol to bring forward the phase out dates. Such a development would bring international ozone protection policies closer to the target dates already established in our national Strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provisions of this Bill will enable Australia to meet its international obligations. The Bill provides for:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.controls on chemicals recently identified by the Parties to the Montreal Protocol as being ozone depleting, and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.a means by which the Government is able to implement policies which will maintain Australia's prominent position in ozone protection.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Eleven substances, comprising methyl chloroform and ten lesser known CFCs, will be incorporated into the licence and quota provisions of the Ozone Protection Act. Licences will only be granted to companies which manufactured, imported or exported the substances during the year 1989. Quotas will be granted to the same companies according to their market share in 1989. This will ensure that there are no new entrants into a diminishing market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The quantity of carbon tetrachloride used in Australia, other than as a feedstock for the manufacture of other chemicals, is so small that a restricted licence system alone is sufficient to meet the policy objectives of controlling supply and providing for essential uses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also includes a provision which enables quotas to be reduced in line with Government policy. In the past the Government has had some difficulty in implementing aspects of the national Strategy because the Ozone Protection Act was tied to the Protocol. The new provision will allow for achievement of the Strategy targets, set in close consultation with industry and community groups.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will therefore have more flexibility in a rapidly changing situation. For instance, the supply of ozone depleting substances can be reduced as implementation of the national Strategy reduces demand. However, I should point out that the Government's commitment to replacing ozone depleting substances is contingent on the reasonable availability of suitable alternative substances and appropriate technology.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Industry has been and will continue to be consulted on the development of Government policies in this area. Although the Government's primary consideration will be to maintain Australia's commitment to ozone protection, we will also seek to minimise impacts on industry by promoting the development of orderly plans for phasing out ozone depleting substances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Decisions made under this provision will be reviewable by application to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the next few years there may be very rapid changes in ozone protection activity throughout the world. The flexibility provided for under this Bill will enable policies which flow from Australia's position during international negotiations, to be implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An example could well be the us of HCFCs as interim CFC substitutes. The national Strategy, which is currently being updated, does not contain a detailed policy on the control of these substances. However, a decision on their control may well be taken at the next meeting of the Protocol Parties in November this year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is also aware that there are practical reasons for Australia's strategies to be linked to those of the international community. In a number of important areas we remain tied to international technologies. Members can envisage the chaos which would result if CFCs were prohibited in domestic refrigerators before suitable alternative technologies became commercially available world-wide.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia consumes less than two per cent of the world's CFCs. The direct impact on the healing of the ozone layer of Australia's phase-out policies is marginal. In particular there is little advantage in regulating to remove the last `drop' of CFCs from circulation at any cost. However, Australia can make a contribution to ozone protection far in excess of our reductions of ozone depleting substances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is in the world's interest for developed countries such as Australia to lead by example, and in so doing, encourage global compliance with international phase-out strategies. This is particularly significant when considering the escalating needs of developing countries for equipment which, at present, is often CFC based. Australia has an important role to play in demonstrating what can be achieved and in pioneering strategies and programs which will be directly relevant to the enormous task which must be faced by developing countries if they are to meet Protocol phase-out targets .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill has no continuing financial implications, as licence fees automatically apply to substances placed on Schedule 1 of the Act and are levied on each kilogram manufactured or imported. A small fee will therefore be collected from companies involved in trading in methyl chloroform and carbon tetrachloride to offset costs of administering the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this Bill, is designed to give effect to the 1990 Amendment to the Montreal Protocol. In addition, it will implement the Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council's national Strategy for Ozone Protection. It is largely a response to initiatives already taken by both Governments and industry, and to the expectations of the community. I believe that the Bill will send a message to all Australians and to the international community that this Government considers protection of the ozone layer to be of the very highest priority.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1991-92, together with Appropriation Bill (No. 4) and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2), which I shall introduce shortly, comprise the Additional Estimates for 1991-92.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In these Bills, Parliament is asked to appropriate moneys to meet essential and unavoidable expenditures additional to the appropriations made for 1991-92 under Appropriation Acts (Nos. 1 and 2) and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Act and to fund in this financial year important initiatives announced in the Prime Minister's recent Economic Statement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of the additional appropriations in the three Additional Estimates Bills totalling $1,116.5m, $834.2m is sought in Appropriation Bill (No. 3), $277.1m in Appropriation Bill (No. 4) and $5.3m in the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amounts are offset, in part, by savings in the Appropriations made by Appropriation Acts (Nos. 1 and 2) 1991-92, reflecting the Government's determination to improve the efficiency of continuing programs as well as changed funding arrangements for AUSTUDY, ABSTUDY and assistance for isolated children which from 1 January 1992 have been funded from a special appropriation agreed to by Parliament in the last session. These savings, amounting to $836.3m in gross terms, are detailed under the relevant appropriation headings in the document `<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Statement of Savings Expected in Annual Appropriations'</EMPHASIS>, which has been distributed to Honourable Members.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After discounting those savings by the amount of $690.8m attributable to the changed funding arrangements I have just mentioned, the net prospective savings identified by departments against the annual appropriations are $144.5m.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After allowing for net prospective savings, the appropriations sought represent a net increase of $971.0m in payments to be financed from annual appropriations in 1991-92, an increase of 2.8 per cent on the amounts made available at the time of the 1991-92 Budget. Excluding funding for Economic Statement initiatives of $115.9m, the net increase represents 2.5 per cent of the 1991-92 annual appropriations, a figure comparable with previous years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now outline some of the main areas for which the Government has found it necessary to seek additional provisions in the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1991-92 to meet payments for the ordinary annual services of the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the Budget figuring contained allowances for prospective wage and salary increases, those amounts were not then appropriated, and funds are now required to meet increases resulting from award decisions. $195.3m is included in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) for increased running costs for all departments and agencies including Defence, an increase of 2.0 per cent on the amount of funding for running costs included in Appropriation Act (No. 1). This amount includes the costs associated with National Wage Case increases, various minor Government initiatives which have been previously announced and transfers between financial years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Gross additional estimates of $219.8m are sought for the Defence Portfolio in Appropriation Bill (No. 3). This figure includes:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">$62.0m for running costs, reflecting higher retention rates than estimated at budget time and the effect of National Wage Increases;</PARA>

It seeks interim appropriations for the ongoing services of the Government during the period 1 July 1992 to 30 November 1992, by which date it is expected that the appropriation Bills, which will form part of the Budget for 1992-93, will have been enacted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supply Bill (No. 1) seeks appropriations totalling some $12,383 million for the ordinary annual services of the Government. This is $320 million, or 2.7 per cent, greater than the equivalent amounts provided in the Supply Act (No. 1) 1991-92.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are now starting a debate on six Bills&mdash;Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 1992-93, Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1991-92, Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1991-92, Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 1992-93, Supply Bill (No. 2) 1992-93 and Supply Bill (No. 1) 1992-93.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difference between the additional Appropriation Bills and the Supply Bills is that the Appropriation Bills, on the one hand, seek to appropriate money that the Government requires to meet its additional expenditures over and above what it had budgeted for last August until 30 June this year&mdash;that is, for the remainder of this financial year. The Supply Bills, on the other hand, seek to appropriate moneys for the period from 1 July 1992 to approximately the end of November 1992&mdash;namely, the first five months of the 1992-93 Budget year&mdash;pending the passing of the Budget Bills, which will not be introduced into the Parliament until mid-August and which take roughly until the end of November for their passage to be completed through both Houses of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The additional Appropriation Bills create an extraordinary situation this year so far as the Senate is concerned. Indeed, we have an unprecedented situation in that Appropriation Bill (No. 3) that was introduced into the House of Representatives a month or so ago, has been amended by the House of Representatives before coming to the Senate. The reason for that was that after introducing Appropriation Bill (No. 3) into the House of Representatives, the Government found that it had grossly miscalculated its estimated requirements for funds and the timing of those requirements. As a result, it introduced an unprecedented Appropriation Bill (No. 5), which was rushed through this Parliament two or three weeks ago and about which we had very considerable debate both here and subsequently in the Estimates committee hearings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government claimed that it had not allowed for contractual commitments for payments that were required in April and May&mdash;the next couple of months&mdash;when looking at the timetable for the passage of Appropriation Bill (No. 3), which is still to be passed because we are debating it at this very moment. It needed approximately an additional $200m of funds, so it amended Appropriation Bill (No. 3) in the House of Representatives, tucked that $200m into a new Appropriation Bill (No. 5), and rushed that Bill through both Houses of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be debate about that matter in the Senate when the Estimates are debated in the committee stage over the next few days, because there is every indication at the moment that the Government misled the Parliament in terms of the need for Appropriation Bill (No. 5). The whole rationale for Appropriation Bill (No. 5) was that there were contractual obligations that the Government had to meet in terms of payments in April and May of this year and, therefore, it had to take the unprecedented action it did in amending Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and bringing in a new Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The officials from the Department of Finance were unable to supply to Senate Estimates Committee B evidence of those contractual commitments. They are on notice to produce any documents that they may have to show this contractual obligation before we resume the Estimates hearings in the next day or so. If the Department of Finance is unable to produce evidence that there were contractual obligations requiring the passage of Appropriation Bill (No. 5) and the consequent amendment to Appropriation Bill (No. 3), there can be no doubt that the Government grossly misled the Parliament in the whole process of seeking that appropriation. No graver indictment could be made of any government than that it misled, wantonly or for whatever other reason, the Parliament of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will be an extremely serious matter if events turn out that way. I will not pursue this matter further because it will be the subject of ongoing debate over the next few days. Suffice it to say, I think for the first time in our history we are considering in the Senate an Appropriation Bill (No. 3) which is seeking a different amount of funds from those sought in the Bill that was introduced initially into the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, the Supply Bills are designed to provide appropriations for the ongoing requirements of government operations during the period 1 July 1992 to 30 November 1992, by which date it is expected that the Appropriation Bills that will form part of the 1992-93 Budget will have been enacted. These are traditional routine machinery measures and, of course, the Opposition will be supporting the Bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The six Bills that we are debating are all money Bills. They have all been introduced at a time when, quite clearly, there is a deteriorating budgetary situation so far as the Government is concerned. When the Government introduced its Budget for 1991-92 last August the Budget deficit for 1991-92 was forecast to be $4.7 billion. That figure has progressively blown out since then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After holding firm to the deficit, the Government was forced in January of this year to admit that it would blow out beyond the $4.7 billion. The figure put on it in January was $5.3 billion. That has gone out further since then. With the additional expenditure measures that are contained in the Government's economic statement&mdash;the so-called One Nation statement&mdash;of 26 February, the Budget deficit is now estimated by the Government to be $6.8 billion. But even that figure is going to be considerably exceeded because that was a forecast as of late February. Since then there has been evidence of a further deterioration in the budgetary situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Officers of the Australian Taxation Office revealed last week in Senate Estimates hearings that there is a shortfall in the revenue for up to the period to the end of February&mdash;the first eight months of this year&mdash;of $600m compared with their expectations. Those same officials admitted that there could be further slippage over the months ahead and that they were working urgently with officials of the Treasury to try to get a revised figure for revenue collections for 1991-92 as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing that is clear is that the deficit will considerably exceed the original $4.7 billion. It will almost certainly exceed $7 billion and is likely to be closer to $8 billion. That is only the Commonwealth's deficit. When we add to that the deteriorating budgetary situation of the States, we find a very worrying situation so far as public sector financing is concerned. The Premiers at their meeting in Melbourne only three days ago revealed that their expected accumulated deficit for 1992-93 will be something of the order of $7.5 billion and that that will be blowing out progressively to in excess of $12 billion by the mid-1990s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we add that to the deficit that we now have, both in actual terms and in prospect, for the Federal Budget, we have a situation where over the next two to three years the public sector in Australia is going to have to draw or borrow funds from the capital markets to the extent of well in excess of $30 billion. It will probably be closer to $40 billion. That is going to put enormous pressure on interest rates in Australia right at the time when the private sector, hopefully, will be in its recovery stages. Sooner or later there has to be a recovery in this country. The recession cannot go on indefinitely. We are going to rely on the private sector to get us out of recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does the Government do? The Government imposes a major constraint on private sector recovery because of its own Budget laxity in not being able to get its own books in proper shape. Therefore, it has to go out and borrow and compete for funds in the market with the private sector. The inevitable result of that is an upward pressure on interest rates at the very time when, if we really want private sector recovery, the pressure on interest rates should be downwards, not upwards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be&mdash;and we will know in the next hour or so when we find out the CPI figure for the March quarter&mdash;that in the short term we shall see some easing in the market pressure on interest rates. If one looks at the much more important situation&mdash;that is, the medium term situation&mdash;one will see that the pressure will be inexorably for upward interest rates because of the inability of this Government to manage its finances in a responsible way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The economic recovery that we would all hope would be in prospect over the next year or so is going to be threatened by that fiscal irresponsibility on the part of government. That is going to be made worse, if I may interpose here, by the arrogant refusal by the Commonwealth Government to contemplate negotiating with the States to give the States a more stable revenue base. The Senate will recall that last October or November the then backbencher Paul Keating made a statement on Commonwealth-State financial relations, absolutely ruling out any prospect of the Commonwealth giving back to the States some of the taxing powers they have taken from the States over many years. It was, indeed, one of the major factors that put additional pressure on the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, and led to his eventual overthrow and political assassination by Paul Keating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now as Prime Minister, Mr Keating is apparently reaffirming that view that he had last year. But at the same time, his Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, was saying on television over the weekend that the States need a better deal in terms of financial base and revenue sources. There is a great state of confusion at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is incumbent on the Commonwealth Government to come clean with the States on just what they are prepared to do by way of reform of Commonwealth-State financial relations. Commonwealth-State financial relations are in a dreadful mess. They have been in a dreadful mess for many years and it is a matter of urgent priority that the mess be addressed so that there be a greater matching of the responsibility of the States to raise the revenue they spend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment, the States spend 50c in every dollar spent by the public sector but raise only about 20c of every dollar raised. That is a very major imbalance between their revenue raising and spending responsibilities that is distorting a large number of activities at the public sector level. Unless that imbalance is addressed, we will be failing to undertake what arguably would be the most significant micro-economic reform that could be undertaken in the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is certainly an issue that the coalition has addressed in a very up-front manner. The coalition has given the matter top priority in its Fightback proposals announced last November. In those proposals we said that we would be prepared to negotiate with the States on the basis of returning to the States some of the income taxing powers that they gave up to the Commonwealth as a so-called temporary wartime measure back in 1942. One way or another, Commonwealth-State financial relations have to be put on a better footing than they are now, and it is a matter of considerable regret that the Commonwealth appears to be intransigently and arrogantly refusing to address those really hard issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The present Prime Minister has been the architect of the economic mismanagement that we have witnessed from this Government throughout the last decade. Mr Keating has pulled the levers&mdash;to quote him&mdash;and has had the Reserve Bank of Australia and Treasury in his pocket for the last decade. He is the person who is single-handedly most responsible for the economic wasteland that has now been created in Australia. The Government's mismanagement has destroyed investment, growth and jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last few days an OECD study has been released which shows that over the last five years Australia has continued to slip in the relative growth stakes. The last time an OECD study was conducted which looked at the ranking of Western world countries adjusted for purchasing power&mdash;that is, changing exchange rates, inflation rates and so on&mdash;was in 1985 when Australia ranked tenth out of the 24 OECD countries in its standard of living as measured in material terms. Now, just five years later, we have slipped to thirteenth place and moved to a position where, on average, we are six percentage points below the OECD average in our standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some very clear reasons for that, one being the failure by the Government to manage its own finances adequately. Another is the distortions that the Government has allowed to occur in our taxation system, distortions which have had a major impact on investment in Australia. Far too large a proportion of our potential investment capital has been put into the infamous shiny office blocks which now stand largely unlet in cities such as my own, Melbourne, and any capital city around Australia. At the same time over the last five years we have spent 9 per cent less than the OECD average on capital equipment and 29 per cent more on the construction of shiny office block buildings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The OECD report also shows that we as a nation have spent 11 per cent more on government consumption than the OECD average. No wonder we have suffered a slippage in our living standards. We are not investing enough, saving enough and producing enough. We have let our productivity growth slide very badly indeed compared with the countries that we have to compete with around the world if we are to maintain or even increase our living standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the decade of the 1980s, average productivity growth in Australia was less than one per cent. It was 0.9 per cent. The average of the OECD and Western world countries was 1.5 per cent per annum. There may not be a great deal of difference between 0.9 and 1.5 per cent, but it is in fact a 60 per cent difference. When that is accumulated progressively through the course of the decade, the impact of it is quite enormous in terms of reducing our competitive position and our ability to sell overseas and compete with imports in our own home markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Business is still very much in the doldrums. In recent days surveys have been conducted by various business organisations. The latest one has come in the past two days from the Confederation of Australian Industry. It has shown that business confidence remains low and the climate for investment remains poor. Over 90 per cent of businesses surveyed thought that present conditions were poor or worse and over 80 per cent thought that the climate for investment was poor or worse than at the time of the previous survey. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the fall in nominal interest rates, real interest rates in this country&mdash;that is, the nominal rate less the rate of inflation&mdash;remain amongst the very highest in the world. Investors who want to borrow money for plant, equipment, growth and development are still being massively disadvantaged by the fact that the real interest rate they face is among the highest in the world. Micro-economic reform in this country has come to a virtual standstill. The push for increased flexibility through labour market reform has stalled. What the Government is doing is mickey mouse stuff when compared with what is required. The union movement, according to the CAI survey, is more intractable than ever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For all those sorts of reasons, most businesses are still reducing employment levels. Forty per cent of businesses surveyed by the CAI expect to reduce employment, and only about 5 per cent expect to put workers on over the next year or so. Approximately half of the businesses said that their production capacity was more than adequate to meet present levels of demand. In other words, the picture from business surveys of companies in Australia&mdash;companies that are going to make or break the recovery that we must at some stage have&mdash;is very pessimistic indeed as to future outlook. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple facts of the matter are that we face very grave problems in Australia of a fundamental nature. They are much more than the problems just associated with the fact that we have the most severe recession in 60 years, serious and grave though that is. It is the recession that has been responsible in large part for the massive growth in unemployment that we have had. We now have a million Australians unemployed, another million who are underemployed, and more than 40 per cent or thereabouts of our young people unable to find work. There could be no more telling or damning indictment of government than that cruel figure, not only for youth unemployment but for unemployment as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason Australia has these problems is not just because of the recession, although that has accentuated and brought them much more to our attention. The problems are more deep-seated than that. One of the basic problems in this country is that we do not save enough. Therefore, we have to draw on the rest of the world. We have put ourselves into hock to the rest of the world to an extent that will mortgage the future of our children and our grandchildren if we do not turn things around very quickly. Ten years ago we owed the rest of the world about $25 billion. Today we owe the rest of the world something like $180 billion, or $150 billion in net terms. The drain that puts on our ability to grow and to increase our living standards is enormous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned earlier our low productivity growth. Low productivity growth and low savings add up to very bad news for this country's economic prospects. Those things have to be turned around. They are the fundamental reasons for the coalition's far-reaching, massive set of proposals contained in the so-called Fightback documents, which are designed specifically to address those problems of low savings and low productivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need a major revamp of the taxation system in this country. We have to reduce the burden of taxation both on individuals and on businesses in their cost of producing goods and services. That is why the coalition's policies for reform include a $13 billion reduction in personal income tax. That is a reduction of between 25 per cent and 30 per cent in the current level of income tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major beneficiaries of that tax cut and tax reform will be low and middle income earners. It is that category of our society, of our work force and of our income earners which has suffered so dramatically and so disastrously at the hands of the tax regime and other regimes of this Government over the last decade. That is why we have targeted families of low and medium income earners with massive increases in spending in family allowances. We are reshaping government spending, whilst reducing the overall level, by better targeting of it and through eliminating a great deal of the waste, duplications and inefficiencies that exist in the public sector and which cause more and more taxpayers' dollars to be inefficiently spent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be a major reform of personal income tax to give back to taxpayers the incentive to work harder, smarter and better. They will do that if they know that they will be able to keep a higher proportion of the reward, rather than paying it back to the Government and the tax man every time they earn an extra dollar. There will be major reductions in the total level of income tax and the marginal tax rates applying to lower and, particularly, middle income earners. That is also why we have proposals to abolish $20 billion of taxes on the cost of doing business in Australia. We have saddled business in Australia with enormous burdens which make business less competitive than it should be. We slug business unmercifully in the course of its producing the very goods and services that we need for jobs, growth, employment and future investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will abolish the wholesale sales tax; the payroll tax; the excise on fuel; and the training guarantee levy, which is another tax on jobs as is the payroll tax burden which is imposed on business in Australia. We will also abolish the Government's ongoing demand for compulsory levies from employers for superannuation purposes. We will encourage greater superannuation in this country through choice, not through coercion and compulsion, which seem to be the only words that this Government knows in terms of implementing its will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unless we do those sorts of things&mdash;unless we seriously tackle the need for tax reform in Australia; unless we seriously tackle the enormous problems that we have in industrial relations and our whole wage fixing system; unless we really get down to the situation where we allow and encourage employer and employee at the enterprise level to sit down and work out the terms and conditions of employment which best suit each enterprise&mdash;we will continue to shackle ourselves and our nation with respect to our growth prospects for the future, not just in terms of material living standards but also in terms of the creation of jobs. Through that, there will be the impact on society from the desperation of the inability to find work and all the things that go with that cause. We are talking about much more than an economic issue; it is a matter of great social importance. The sooner the Government realises that and the sooner it seriously gets down to doing the things that need to be done the better. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In three of the Bills, and Senator Short referred to others&mdash;the Supply (Parliamentary Departments) Bill, Supply Bill (No. 1) and Supply Bill (No. 2)&mdash;the Government is seeking an increase of some $16.5 billion for government expenditure. In Supply (Parliamentary Departments) Bill, we find an increase of 3 per cent; in Supply Bill (No. 1), we find an increase of 2.7 per cent; we then get to Supply Bill (No. 2) and we find a massive increase of 17.3 per cent. This is just not the way to run a business; it is a disaster route. Of course, that comes through when one starts examining what is occurring in Australia at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple facts are that governments, like businesses and households, have to cut their cloth according to their income; it is an essential, simple, economic fact. Against this background here in Australia now we find that we have, as is well known, unemployment of one million. The sad part about the one million unemployed is that, apart from the individuals themselves not having a job, they have no hope of getting a job&mdash;there are no prospects in the near future. In fact, the real prospect, unfortunately, is that that figure is more likely to increase than decrease. Looking at the Government's policies and its approach to constructive medium and long term policy making, it does not have any plan that is likely to address that particular problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other side of the coin&mdash;a matter that I have raised in this chamber on a number of occasions&mdash;there are bankruptcies. Bankruptcies highlight the likely prospect of business being able to address the unemployment situation. For example, last year there were some 13,091 bankruptcies. Already this year, in three quarters we have almost reached that figure&mdash;in fact, we are 174 short. The figure this year now stands at 12,917 and with the number of part X arrangements in the pipeline, which are significantly higher than normal, that figure, really, is significantly higher.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of last year's record bankruptcy figures, we are looking at an annual increase this year of between 30 per cent and 40 per cent. That is on last year's record increases, which amounted to 50-odd per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The comparative figures for the March quarter last year show that there was an increase of 44.1 per cent in the number of bankruptcies. So with those one million people who do not have jobs, and those who are on the edge of losing their jobs, with that level of bankruptcies occurring in Australia there is little hope of business picking up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to go deeper into it. I have with me the recent Confederation of Australian Industry survey. The Confederation of Australian Industry is the employer organisation that the Government consistently quotes as being the peak employer organisation. I want to run through some of the research that the Confederation has done resulting from its survey. Looking at the Confederation's estimation of the current position, it must be remembered that this survey has been done since the One Nation program was brought down, so it reflects the most recent attitudes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In April 1991, 0.6 per cent of businesses surveyed thought that current business conditions were good. Incidentally, no-one thought they were excellent or very good. The number of businesses which thought conditions were poor was 41.7 per cent. In July 1991, 1.7 per cent of businesses surveyed thought that business conditions were good while 42.1 per cent thought they were poor. In November 1991, 0.7 per cent of businesses thought conditions were good while 51.1 per cent thought they were poor. In April 1992, 0.6 per cent of businesses thought conditions were good while 44.2 per cent thought they were poor. So that is what business thinks of business conditions under the current Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The climate for investment is a very important aspect in terms of recovery. In April 1991, 4.2 per cent of businesses thought it was good while 43.1 per cent thought it was poor. In July 1991, 1.7 per cent thought it was good while 45 per cent thought it was poor. In November 1991, 4.3 per cent thought it was good while 48.9 per cent thought it was poor. In April 1992, 1.2 per cent of businesses thought the investment climate was good&mdash;that is a drop of 3 per cent over the November quarter, even though it is a very small figure&mdash;while 45.7 per cent of businesses thought it was poor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to that part of the survey which deals with conditions within business. In July 1991, 5 per cent of businesses thought conditions were good while 34.2 per cent thought they were poor. In November 1991, 16.1 per cent thought they were good while 33.6 per cent thought they were poor. In April 1992, 12.8 per cent thought conditions were good while 31.1 per cent thought they were poor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The levels of sales within businesses is contained a little further on in the survey. In July 1991, 9.2 per cent of businesses thought sales were good while 42 per cent thought they were poor. In November 1991, 12 per cent thought conditions were good while 33.8 per cent thought they were poor. In April 1992, 14.7 per cent of businesses thought sales were good while 36.8 per cent thought they were poor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many more figures in this survey that are very instructive. The Government should take note of them. According to the survey done by the Confederation of Australian Industry, the indication of businesses is that they are pessimistic and very concerned about their future and their ability to invest, expand and increase sales at a time when we are in the worst recession&mdash;for many, a depression&mdash;for 60-odd years in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there is some hope for Australia. I will use Treasury figures from an analysis made on the impact of the Fightback package in removing taxes on both business and a number of people in the community. Once again, these figures are very instructive. It is notable that the Government has little to say about them because they highlight the advantages and improvements that would occur in the Australian scenario if the policies in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> were introduced. They signify very clearly that there would be significant drops in both the costs of doing business in this country and the cost of living. There would be an improvement for both business and households. Flowing from that is employment, our capacity to meet our current account deficits and improve them, an ability to begin to stabilise our national debt, which Senator Short mentioned, and an ability to then go about the process of reducing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the overall impact of the Fightback strategy&mdash;and I repeat that this analysis was done by Treasury&mdash;and we take into account the abolition of payroll tax, excise changes, the abolition of wholesale sales tax and the impact of GST, we find that there is a saving to agriculture of $1.025 billion. If we look at mining, we find a saving of $677m. If we look at manufacturing, we find a saving of $5.3 billion in operating costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hear a lot from the Government benches, and particularly from the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Simon Crean, about value-adding in this country. The Minister has emphasised this aspect on a number of occasions. The best thing that that Minister could do would be to put pressure on the Government to adopt this package. If one were able to introduce that sort of cost saving to businesses in this country, there would be a chance of getting value-adding off the ground. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me go through a number of other points in terms of industry analysis, because once again they are very instructive. We see that for food, beverage and tobacco, there is a cost saving to those industries of $1.336 billion. For textiles, there is a saving of $177m; clothing and footwear, a saving of $139m; paper and paper products, a saving of $440m; chemicals, a saving of $749m. If we look at electricity, gas and water, we find is a saving of $699m, which would impact very significantly not only on the costs of doing business, but also on the costs to households. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look down the list a little further at services to the wholesale and retail trades, we see a saving in the cost of doing business of $2.928 billion; transport and storage, a saving of $2.086 billion; road transport, a saving of $1.147 billion in the cost of doing business; communications, a saving of $538m; and in finance and business services a saving of $860m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One works further through this list. It is a comprehensive list and, thanks to the shadow Treasurer, Mr Peter Reith, it is now a public document and available for all to see. One finds in almost every instance savings to the cost of doing business in this country and significant savings to the costs of being a householder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does this all mean? It means that if we get our costs down, Australian business and Australian householders  will be in a much better position to start to see a rise in the standards of living. It will mean that we shall be in a much stronger position to be able to address some of our fundamental problems in terms of unemployment, and to arrest the bankruptcies that are increasing at an appalling rate. We do not hear a lot about bankruptcies in the public arena, but they are a real fact of life and cause a great deal of trauma for many people. Bankruptcy is an enormous social cost to the Australian community and more attention needs to be paid to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we turn the page and look at some of the other examples of what is occurring and break them down, we find that in terms of investment the abolition of payroll tax will cut costs by $727m; the excise changes will cut costs by $604m. The abolition of the wholesale sales tax will cut costs by $3.166 billion. If we take away the cost of the implementation of the goods and services tax, we find that investment in this country will be $1.908 billion better off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Exports are the key to our ability to address our current account situation. For too long, virtually for the past decade, we saw this Government act on the false premise that the way to balance our current account deficit was to try to screw people into the ground and stop imports coming into this country. That process and the high interest regime&mdash;a regime  which hurt so many people so badly&mdash;failed. Those methods will not stop the blow-out in the current account deficit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only way to overcome our current account deficit is to make our exporters internationally competitive, allowing them to compete in the international marketplace by taking off their backs the costs of doing business. Australia has an enormous capacity to increase its production, whether it be in the area of agriculture, mining or any other form of exporting in which we may be involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the Treasury analysis of the cost of doing business under the Fightback package, we find that the abolition of the payroll tax will save exporters in this country some $603m. Abolition of fuel excise will produce a cost saving of $877m. The abolition of the wholesale sales tax will produce a cost saving of $803m. As a result of the changes made in the Fightback package, total net savings to exporters amount to some $1.976m&mdash;almost $2 billion.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Fightback program there is a cut of some $20 billion in direct input taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I emphasise how important that is to the overall cash flow of businesses in Australia. When we think about the imposition of payroll taxes, excises and the wholesale sales tax, we realise that all those costs have to be paid before one cent is earned. In many cases business has to increase its overdraft to meet its commitments in respect of input taxes, which once again has a flow-on impact because of the interest rate costs that are involved in that area. Real interest rates in Australia are so much higher than they are in most other countries in the world. This is a major problem, and it is a reflection of this Government's mismanagement of its fiscal and monetary policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now turn to the current position in the Australian scene. Last August we were told that the Budget deficit would be less than $5 billion; that figure was later readjusted to $6.8 billion. I believe that we are now looking at a Budget deficit in the order of $8 billion. This Government has failed miserably in adjusting its programs and expenditure to make sure that the cost of doing business in this country and the cost of employment can be paid for and budgeted for accurately. Furthermore, the Government itself has also failed. In the past two years we have seen a massive turnaround in the Budget deficit blow-outs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is essential in any operation that at the end of the day we earn more than it costs us. To emphasise the consequences if we do not, I need only highlight the impact of bankruptcy statistics that I mentioned earlier. It looks as if this year we will end up with an increase of 40 per cent on the massive blow-out in bankruptcies which occurred last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to turn briefly to a number of other aspects which are very important in addressing the fact that Australia is spending significantly more than it is earning. There are a number of things that need to be done, and they need to be done urgently. Probably the most important one of all is to reform our industrial relations system. The theme of the Government's industrial policy has been based on the centralised wage fixing system. It now tries to pretend that it is working towards workplace or enterprise agreements, but they are not really enterprise agreements. They have to go back to the Industrial Relations Commission. They involve unions, union bullying and union bludgeoning. They have to fit in between the sweetheart deals that have been done between the two Ks&mdash;Prime Minister Keating and the Secretary of the ACTU, Mr Kelty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These enterprise agreements are not designed in the best interests of Australia. They do not take into account what really occurs in the workplaces in the Australian community. They have no consideration for the differing circumstances in Western Australia and New South Wales or in Queensland and South Australia or in Tasmania and the Northern Territory. They try to force the same set of rules and the same conditions right across the board in every workplace in Australia. Woe betide people who try to step out of that system. They will find themselves in the courts; they will face strike action; they will find themselves being bludgeoned by the ruthless actions of a small minority of the Australian community who by irresponsible industrial action cause costs to blow out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can liken much of what is occurring in many workplaces of Australia to guerilla action. Much of it is not about conditions in the workplace any more: it is about maintaining the hierarchy of the ACTU; it is about keeping the jobs of union officials; it is about bullying many people in the workplace who would much prefer to get on, do their job, earn their money, be productive and see improvements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to lift our industrial relations performance in this country and allow employers and employees to sit down and make their own arrangements. It seems to me to be absolutely extraordinary in a country that is supposed to be built on freedom that under our current industrial relations system individuals are barred from making their own agreements in the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we take that a little further&mdash;we will be dealing with this over the next week or two&mdash;we now find that this Parliament and the Australian community are threatened by a Bill which will endeavour to regulate contractors by bringing them under the auspices of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. All that has come out of the fact that some people with a bit of initiative, commonly known as Troubleshooters, worked out a plan which has been tested before Mr Justice Woodward in the Federal Court, before the <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>Full Bench of the Federal Court and before the High Court and has been found to be legal. Yet we see this Government endeavouring to put barriers in the way of sensible industrial relations reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the time remaining, I would like to comment on two or three other things that are essential ingredients of the Fightback package in terms of getting this country back into profitability again. I have mentioned the impact of the various up-front indirect taxes that we have. I have mentioned the industrial relations system. The next thing that is absolutely crucial is infrastructure reform, whether it be in the transport area, on the waterfront, in the communications area or in any of the myriad of things that we have before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard much about the amount of money that has been spent on the waterfront. We have heard about the massive redundancy payouts. I have yet to see&mdash;and I have endeavoured to get this evidence&mdash;where the cost of doing business across the waterfront has gone down because of the enormous investment that has been made from the public purse to finance the so-called restructuring process that is being carried out on the waterfront. I do not believe that there is evidence that actually shows that the costs have fallen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We still have the ridiculous situation where it is cheaper to take a shipload of wheat from Australia to London than it is to take the same ship with a similar cargo across from Tasmania to Melbourne. There are many more examples of this kind of thing. Shipping reform and waterfront reform in this country are still an abject failure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen decreases in the cost of doing business in the transport sector only in those areas where there is deregulation and competition has been increased. There are a number of examples of this, particularly in my State of Western Australia. We find that costs continue to go up in areas where regulation has been maintained, where road has been stopped from competing with rail or where road has been franchised and stopped from competing with itself. However, costs come down as soon as a little bit of competition is introduced into the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come from an area that has been deregulated. When deregulation was introduced, I found that my transport costs dropped by about of 50 per cent. In fact, after the system in my area was deregulated and the monopoly franchise that one operator had was abolished, the cost of carting a tonne of superphosphate from the Esperance fertiliser works to my farm dropped from $11.80 a tonne to $5 a tonne. That is the sort of cost saving that is around if one is prepared to introduce competition into the marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has been an abject failure in relation to all of the matters that I have raised today. The simple fact is that we cannot go on spending more than we earn. One only has to ask any householder or any businessman to find out that this is the case. Fightback is about reducing costs, returning profit to business and allowing Australia and Australians to balance their budgets. In the process of doing that we will be able to start reducing our debt and begin employing some of the one million people who do not have a job at this time. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last night the debate, from the Government's perspective, on the so-called Treasury analysis of the Fightback package came unstuck. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Treasurer Dawkins was required under the Freedom of Information Act to release a number of other papers which related to this analysis. These papers showed that rather than 70 per cent of households being worse off under the Fightback package, in fact 80 per cent of households were better off, even using some of the very strange assumptions that the Treasury unit had used in its modelling of the Fightback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The work of the Treasury, the work of the Government, and its attempt to attack the Fightback package is back in the news today. I wish to address my remarks in this cognate debate to some particular aspects of this debate. I think we are all aware of the role the Treasury had in the analysis of the Fightback package. What I thought I would do today is look at some aspects of that role&mdash;some of the issues which are raised by the Government's use of the Department of the Treasury, the use of Treasury officers and the use of taxpayers' funds in its efforts to attack the Fightback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there are important issues of principle here. We have a full time, fully taxpayer funded unit to analyse every word Opposition spokesmen and women say on radio and television so that it can be reported to the Government of the day, within the hour if possible. In relation to the use of the Treasury, I believe this is the first time that a major unit has been established, funded very extravagantly by the taxpayer, where senior officers have been appointed with the principal role, the principal purpose, of analysing policies. I am certainly aware, as is Senator Richardson, that in the past public servants and government departments have analysed policies which oppositions have presented. They have provided briefing notes to the government of the day on that particular issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a sensitive area but, nonetheless, it has been the practice and Senator Richardson and Senator Faulkner would be quite right to point out that this has happened in the past. What has never happened in the past is the setting up of a specialised unit in a major government department. This Department is perhaps arguably the most important Government Department. Its sole aim over a period of many months was to analyse and attempt to attack an Opposition policy. There is an issue of principle there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree that just what government departments should do in this area is a matter for debate, but even after the Treasury was asked to set up this unit it was clear from at least one or two public comments that Tony Cole made, who was then the Secretary to the Treasury, that the Treasury was aware of the sensitivities of this particular matter. In a press release on 26 November last year, Tony Cole said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Treasury has always been aware of the sensitivities surrounding such analysis and is mindful of not involving any officers in activities that go beyond this traditional role.</PARA>
<PARA>Even at that stage, the Secretary to the Treasury was mindful of the sensitivities of what the Government had asked it to do on its behalf. It was important for the Government because, frankly, no-one will believe anything this Government says. We can mention a whole host of areas where Prime Minister Paul `There-will-be-no-recession' Keating has deliberately misled the Australian people on a number of important and vital occasions. Frankly, no-one would believe anything Mr Keating, Mr Dawkins and their colleagues say about Opposition policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government needed to see whether it could trade off the authority, independence and standing of the Treasury to cloak its attack on the Fightback package. The Government could not do it itself, because no-one would believe it. For eight years this Government has been guilty of misleading the Australian people on fundamental issues. What the Government had to do&mdash;to use Mr Keating's famous words when he said, `I've got the Reserve Bank in my pocket'&mdash;was to try to get the Treasury in its pocket. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a first step, the Treasury was asked to set up a unit to model indirect and direct tax changes. It was pretty clear from day one what the purpose of this unit was. We should not beat about the bush; the purpose of the unit was to attempt to undermine the Opposition's Fightback package. Even in those early days it was pretty clear that Tony Cole was aware of the sensitivities of what the Government was asking the Treasury to do. Given the sensitivities involved, what would we have wanted the Public Service to do, knowing full well that the Government wanted to cloak its political attack on the Opposition by purporting to use the independence, the authority and the standing of that great Department, the Commonwealth Treasury?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of mistakes were made and I wish to run through these today. I want to make a contribution to this really important issue concerning the extent to which governments are able to use Treasury and other great departments of government to carry out their dirty political work. What is the role of public servants when asked to perform these functions?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, the first mistake was to allow the unit to be established. I do not think it helps when people like Dr Preston, who was in charge of the operational and day to day activities of this modelling unit, pretend that it was established for any other purpose than to analyse the Opposition's policies. In statements before the Senate Estimates Committee B, Dr Preston persisted with the view that the purpose of the unit was to establish and develop the software and model indirect and direct tax changes. The reality is that the unit was essentially and principally established to attack the Fightback program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We asked Dr Preston when he appeared before the Estimates Committee whether this unit and the model which was developed had been used to model the One Nation package. One would not have thought that was a complex question. The Government can find the resources to establish a unit to develop the software to model tax changes. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>One Nation package had major tax changes and the question was: was the One Nation package modelled by the Treasury? If you had been before that Committee, Madam Acting Deputy President, you would have seen the ducking and weaving that went on. In my view it did Dr Preston no credit, and Senator McMullan kept on chipping in to try to divert the questioning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why be so coy?  The Government has set up a major unit and spent a lot of money on it. It has diverted important officers to work in this unit, but we cannot even find out whether the `No Nation' package was modelled. I call it the `No Nation' policy, because the policies followed by Mr Keating in an attempt to cover up the disaster of his unemployment policies will cause massive division. Let us call it what it is; it is a `No Nation' policy. We asked whether that major statement by the Government had been modelled and the answer was, `We don't know'. That is a matter that Senator Short and I will be keen to pursue when the Estimates Committee B report comes before Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was admitted before Estimates Committee B that some $300,000 had been spent on this exercise, and this did not include a lot of other expenses from what I could gather. Remember that the Government has modelled the superannuation policies of the Fightback package up to 1995-96. The same Dr Preston, when before the Senate Select Committee on superannuation, was asked whether the Government's policies on occupational superannuation had been modelled to the year 1995-96&mdash;this major new initiative by the Government, which people in business around Australia are complaining vigorously about, principally because it is going to create even more unemployment than we have at the moment&mdash;and he answered no. Why?  He said it was a matter of cost; it was a matter of priorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, the Treasury rightly pointed out that it does not have unlimited resources; it cannot do work on every particular aspect which comes before it. Apparently it can find the money to model the superannuation policies of the Opposition, but it cannot find the money to model its own superannuation policies. It is an extraordinary thing to find that the resources of the taxpayer, which are principally designed to fund government departments to help governments develop their policies, are being spent for political purposes on attacking the Opposition. But when we ask whether the Government has been prepared to subject its own policies to the same analysis by the same Department, the answer is no, the Department has not been able to give that a sufficient priority.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think, therefore, that establishes that this unit really should not have been established. Clearly, the Department did not have the money to divert to this particular area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was also, of course, the vital issue of principle: just how far government departments should go in the analysis of their political opponents' policies and whether, in fact, it is proper by any measure for a government to establish such a unit when one looks at the way this unit was established and the reason for its establishment. The fact is that the Treasury did not have sufficient resources, apparently, to do the work on the Government's own policies. From my conversations with Treasury officers, I gathered that a number of them were clearly unhappy with the establishment of this particular unit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, in my view, the first mistake made was to establish the unit. It is not clear that the Secretary, Mr Tony Cole, expressed any great concern to the Government at having been asked to establish it. I agree that there is an issue. If the Government demands that a unit be set up, it puts the particular officers in a difficult position when they know that the unit is going to be used for political purposes.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why should not the Government be up front and establish the unit in Senator Richardson's office? It seemed to be a political unit. Frankly, a number of the officers who were employed in this unit clearly have worked with the Government before and would have been quite happy to work out of Senator Richardson's office, then we would have seen exactly what this grubby exercise was all about. But no, the Government tried to cloak it with the authority and the independence of the Treasury. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second mistake to be made was with the personnel appointed to the Committee. I would like to read a fairly lengthy quote to the Senate that was prepared by a former Secretary of the Treasury, Mr John Stone, on this very issue. He wrote in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, on 12 March 1992:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The standards of behaviour of the Commonwealth Public Service, and particularly of key departments such as the Treasury, are much more important to the future of good governance of Australia than the standards of behaviour of our politicians&mdash;from either side&mdash;or of the ABC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In another sense, however, the choice of Dr Henry was (in my view) unfortunate because he had also spent several of the intervening years working as Private Secretary (Taxation) in Mr Keating's Private Office. He could therefore not unreasonably be seen&mdash;and not only by the Opposition&mdash;as coming to this new task with his apolitical public service credentials inevitably impaired . . . This error of judgment by the Treasury Executive was, in my view, compounded by the fact that at least two other Treasury officers involved in the new modelling work had also served for periods of time within Mr Keating's Private Office during his time as Treasurer.</PARA>
<PARA>Obviously, Mr Stone was referring to Mr Smith and Ms Furnell. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The make-up of the personnel of such a unit is important, especially in a highly charged political atmosphere. It was the second mistake for the Secretary of the Treasury not to use his judgment to ensure that, if he decided to follow the Government's instructions to establish such a unit, it was staffed in a way which would at least ensure that the public perception of the unit and its work could be less clouded than it is because of the fact that a number of key appointments to the unit clearly had very close associations with the former Treasurer and the now Prime Minister, Mr Keating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third mistake happened during the working of this unit. Clearly, records were not kept. Dr Preston stated on a number of occasions in evidence before the Estimates Committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the Treasurer's office&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">did not tell us how to do the analysis.</PARA>
<PARA>The Government stated that it had no direct input into having an influence on the analysis of the Fightback document. But, as Dr Preston's answer admits, many `instructions' were given. In evidence before the Committee, it was established that the Treasurer's office was in constant communication with the unit. Dr Preston said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not know how many instructions we have had. We had a discussion about that earlier this morning. We have no way of keeping track of the number of instructions.</PARA>
<PARA>He concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We had no instruction on how to do the analysis.</PARA>
<PARA>I have to make a number of comments on that. Knowing the political sensitivities of this issue and knowing the habit of the Public Service to keep notes of conversations with Ministers' offices&mdash;one day Senator Richardson may rue the fact that public servants keep notes of conversations with Ministers' offices&mdash;one would have thought that the experienced public servants involved would have kept a record of the conversations that they had had and the instructions that they had been given by the Treasurer's office. Indeed, I have checked again with public servants and I understand that many public servants adopt that practice, particularly in these highly charged political areas. Apparently, that was not the case in the work of the unit which had been established to attack the Fightback policies. In this sense, I believe that Dr Preston, having been in charge of the operational aspects of the unit, should have exercised more supervision and care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can all understand that the Treasury did the number crunching&mdash;no-one is arguing that. But the Government fed in the assumptions that made sure that the result of the analysis, to the extent that it could, would be unfavourable. Of course, the Government then wanted to pass off this biased result as a Treasury analysis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This leads me to the next error that I believe Treasury made, and this was in the critical choice of the inflation assumption. My colleague Senator Short, in fairly extensive questioning before Estimates Committee B of Senator McMullan, Dr Preston and Mr Fraser, went very carefully through this particular exercise. Anyone who wants to pursue this at some length should take the trouble to read that particular evidence given to Estimates Committee B. Senator Short pointed to the critical fact that an inflation figure of 7 per cent was used. He asked Dr Preston why he used an inflation figure contained in a scenario which the document quite specifically said was not part of the Fightback modelling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the modelling carried out by the Treasury unit, there was an inflation assumption of 7 per cent and a wages growth of 3.5 per cent. As Senator Short pointed out, it was ludicrous for Treasury to have used an inflation figure of 7 per cent with a 3.5 per cent real wages growth figure when analysing the consequences of the Fightback package for the simple reason that this implies a very substantial fall in real wages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that when Senator Short asked the Deputy Secretary, John Fraser, about this particular assumption he agreed that the key assumption used by Treasury to analyse the Fightback package was unrealistic. Therefore, the second most senior Treasury officer disagrees&mdash;and this is important&mdash;with the assumptions developed by Dr Henry and his colleagues in the unit. That is a pretty important story but, let us face it, I doubt whether one will see that on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program. Nonetheless, it shows that the claims by the Prime Minister and by the Treasurer that 70 per cent of wage and salary earners would be worse off under the Fightback package are wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, as I mentioned at the commencement of my remarks, some documents that were released under freedom of information last night make it pretty clear that those wild, foolish and silly claims made by the Prime Minister are undermined by other work that Treasury had done which were released very late in the piece indeed. So that was the fourth mistake that was made. The unit failed in its efforts to produce assumptions to analyse the document which were soundly based, based at least on the document itself, and could also be sustained by their internal coherence with other assumptions that were made. Not only has this analysis been condemned more widely but also it is interesting to see that Treasury itself regards the assumptions which were made to analyse the Fightback package as very flawed indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not require a PhD in econometrics or some $300,000 of taxpayers' money to work out that if one assumes a high inflation rate and, as a result, one creates bracket creep and then refuses to give the windfall gains back to the taxpayer everyone will be worse off. So Treasury, by following the instructions of the Treasurer's office, by ceaselessly feeding these in and doing the number crunching for the Government, was able to produce a piece of paper at least which clearly excited the interests of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> and the press. But, as we saw last night in the papers released under the freedom of information and the comments made before Estimates B by Mr John Fraser, the key assumptions used in the analysis of the Fightback package were fatally flawed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This brings me to the fifth mistake that I believe the Treasury made. Once the documents were in the public domain, it was clear from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program&mdash;the program which got all the press coverage&mdash;that these papers were being represented as Treasury papers. The interesting thing is that I asked Dr Preston in Estimates Committee B:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Dr Preston</EMPHASIS>&mdash;It may have been described as such but I knew that it was not.</PARA>
<PARA>So this great big beat-up that we had on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> based on Treasury documents was repudiated in Estimates B by Treasury officers. They said that they were not Treasury documents. The documents were prepared in the Treasurer's office. Had that been known on the night, that would have substantially undermined the general thrust of that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It thus raises the issue that Treasury's name is being used for political purposes. The Treasury should have put out a press release the following day, after it had seen the documents, indicating that they were not Treasury documents. As I said at the start of my remarks, it was important to clothe the Government attack in the independence and authority of the Treasury. It is a discussion I have had with Treasury officers. The views are a bit mixed. Some find that it certainly would be awkward for the Treasury to put out a press release saying, `Hey, your big story last night was all wrong; it wasn't a Treasury document'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator MacGibbon has a far longer experience in this place than myself. I do not know about him, but it is certainly my memory that, from time to time when fraudulent documents are produced in the public arena which are claimed to be departmental documents, governments and departments in the past have made it very clear that they are fraudulent documents. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator MacGibbon; we do not expect the Government to act in an honourable way. The point of my remarks is whether Treasury should have acted in an honourable way and declared the documents fraudulent. It is a difficult issue. Certainly, given the nature of the supposed leak and the public excitement that it occasioned, it would have been interesting to see whether it was ever considered in Treasury&mdash;a Treasury determined to maintain its independence and integrity&mdash;that it should have put out a statement saying that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> documents were not Treasury documents.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to use the Appropriation Bills before the Senate this morning to talk about the Civil Aviation Authority. Aviation is very important to this country. One of our great difficulties is that the general public does not understand how the system is regulated by the regulatory authority&mdash;how it works, what it does and what place it has in the scheme of things. The average taxpayer gets onto a nice, clean, well presented airliner, flies with safety and, on most occasions, at the appointed time gets to where he or she wants to go; he or she thinks everything is going very well. The average taxpayer does not understand the process that brings all that about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That process is different from the way other departments of state or statutory authorities operate. It is quite different to the way the welfare system works&mdash;the old age pension, for example&mdash;under the Department Social Security; the Australian Taxation Office, which Senator Kemp was talking about a few minutes ago; and the Treasury. It is different. It has its own legislative base. It has its own terminology. It has its own practices which have grown up over roughly the last 90 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the great difficulties in getting debate going in the Parliament and, therefore, hearing any informed comment on aviation in the Parliament, is that parliamentarians do not know very much about the aviation industry either, although they are very big users of it, spending a large part of their lives travelling in aeroplanes around this country. It is an important industry and it is important that we understand what is going on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia we had a dedicated department of state&mdash;the old Department of Civil Aviation&mdash;which existed for many years and regulated and controlled aviation in this country. It was a very good department. It had a lot of outstanding people. It had some outstanding men as its Director. It was staffed by people who understood the industry, who understood what they were meant to be doing and how to apply their knowledge for the benefit of the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we had the reforming zeal of that great zealot Mr Whitlam, who came along nearly 20 years ago and got rid of the Department of Civil Aviation saying, `Aviation is just another form of transport. It is no different from running trains or ships. We will have a Department of Transport&mdash;a mega-department&mdash;and we will all be super-efficient and move into the modern age'. Since the advent of the Whitlam years there have been a number of major changes in the naming of the Department of Aviation. It has been called the Department of Transport, the Department of Aviation&mdash;a whole lot of things&mdash;and that has had a most significant effect on its efficiency and morale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, we arrived at the misfortune of having the Hawke Government. The Hawke Government decided that it would no longer persist with the Department of Civil Aviation in whatever guise it was operating and would, in the jargon of the times, get it off-budget. It set up two statutory authorities, namely the Civil Aviation Authority and the Federal Airports Corporation, to change it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whatever the ideals that might have motivated this change, the fact of the matter is that the move has been a disaster for the Australian community. I doubt very much whether the situation can be retrieved. I think a very good argument could be made&mdash;and I am personally persuaded to this view&mdash;for going back to having a department of state under the control of the Minister and seeing whether we can resurrect the regulatory system in an efficient and effective way for the benefit of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, the Government has said, `We have to get this off-budget. We will make the authorities self-sufficient and it won't cost the taxpayers anything'. In doing that the Government sold all the assets which were owned by the Australian taxpayer&mdash;the airfields, the air traffic control facilities, all the infrastructure of aviation in Australia&mdash;to these two authorities, the CAA and the FAC, at grossly inflated contemporary prices. It then told the two authorities, `You pay us a dividend on the money&mdash;the thousands of millions of dollars&mdash;you have invested'. It was grossly dishonest to sell something that was owned by the Australian taxpayers to an authority, and to then tell that authority to make a profit on those inflated sales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The exercise turns on two other fashionable beliefs&mdash;the belief of cost recovery and the belief that the user pays. To some degree those two beliefs are intertwined. The concepts are self supporting in a way because the Government is saying that under the cost recovery doctrine the aviation industry will pay for the regulatory system, while with the user-pays concept it is saying that those who use the aviation facilities will also pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cost recovery is perhaps practical if we can define the use and if the cost can be recovered from those who are making use of the facility. But in the case of aviation it is not the person who is flying from Sydney to Melbourne this morning who is the exclusive user of the airways system. The whole community gets the benefit. Efficient transport is essential to Australia; it is as essential as a good public health system and a good educational system, and we have all the indirect benefits that flow from it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We try to make a great deal of money out of tourism. Tourism in this country cannot exist without an aviation industry to bring people into Australia and to fly them around the country when they get in. The tourism industry provides a great boost for the building industry; look at all the five-star hotels that have been built in your State, Madam Acting Deputy President. We have seen hundreds, if not billions, of dollars invested in hardware to support the tourist industry. Think of the employment that the tourist industry brings to Australia&mdash;the tens of thousands of people who are now providing services, such as catering services. Those people owe part or all of their employment to the aviation industry.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there is definitely a public interest component in this area. I do not believe any thinking senator would deny that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty comes in ascribing a proportion to the public interest component in the overall costs. I could come up with only a rough estimate that probably the public interest component is around 25 to 40 per cent. I am open to negotiation on that. But it cannot be denied that this public interest component exists. If we concede that there is a public interest component, the doctrine of cost recovery solely from the users of the aviation industry is untenable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The user pays system sets out to recover from the citizen using the airways the hundreds of millions of dollars involved in the regulatory function. This taxing base is a very small base. If that is going to happen, the citizen who is travelling on the aircraft from Sydney to Melbourne this morning who is paying as a user for those air services is quite entitled to expect that the Government will reduce his personal income tax and the other indirect taxes to compensate for it. Unless that is done, the Government is double dipping; it is getting in twice. The Government is maintaining taxation at the same level&mdash;probably this Government is sneaking it up all the time&mdash;yet it is getting one of its expenses off budget, namely, the provision of aviation services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other great difficulty with the user pays concept is that the user simply has no right to say no; there is no power of veto. The consultative system set up under this Government for the clients of the CAA&mdash;the aircraft owners, the pilots, and the users of the aviation industry&mdash;are ineffectual. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the day, the CAA always gets what it wants; there is no right of veto. It is very similar to going into a restaurant for a hamburger and a cup of coffee and being billed at the end of that cup of coffee for a five-course meal with an extensive wine bill. We just have to pay, just as we do not have any say at all in what the Authority provides. The Authority always provides a gold-plated service, way beyond what people in the general aviation sector&mdash;at the private, recreational and charter level&mdash;require. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the Authority has been in operation, it has reduced the number of staff to about 65 per cent of the number of staff that existed beforehand. There have been huge redundancy payments for those members of staff who have been made to take premature retirement. It has also paid huge salary increases to the remaining staff, compared with what it was paying when it was a department of state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The big difficulty that one encounters is the lack of accountability. We cannot get the Department before the Parliament very readily to explain what it is doing. It is an absolute fundamental of our democracy that we have the right to get statutory authorities and departments of State to explain what they are doing and how they are expending public funds. We should remember that the money raised by taxation or levies by the Civil Aviation Authority is public funds; it is not a private funding of the CAA, as the present Chief Executive Officer seems to think it is and that therefore he does not have to account for it. He certainly does have to account for what he is doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen a number of cases of abuse of authority by the Civil Aviation Authority. In my experience, the number of abuses are significantly higher than they were when the process was operating through a department of state. We know about the shabby history of the CAA which has put liens on aircraft owned by people who did not pay their bills. On a number of occasions in taking this action the Authority has operated outside the law. It frankly admits that it breached the law. It then says to the poor client, `If you don't like it, see us in court'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the matter reaches the court, it is often the case  that a lot of the clients who have been disadvantaged in this way and who  have had liens placed on their aircraft simply cannot pay the legal bills. One person in such a position in my own State of Queensland told me that although his case would have been supported in court, he was required to deposit $40,000 as surety for the legal fees or court expenses before he could get into the court. He said, `Frankly, I haven't got anywhere near that sort of money'. Therefore, to a large extent the CAA operates with impunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal difficulty with the Authority flows from its rapacious desire to tax the industry under this cost recovery doctrine. One of the things that is coming up in the near future is a safety regulatory levy which will be applied to all certificate of registration holders on the Australian register. In essence, that is all those people who own aircraft in the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interesting thing about this is that in 1984 an inquiry known as the Bosch inquiry was set up to look into the whole business of financing aviation in this country. Amongst other things, it recommended that the Government should clean up the inefficiencies over an 8-years to 10-years period in the regulation of the Australian aviation industry. When that was done, it was felt that those concerned should be close to attaining cost recovery. The inquiry indicated that cost recovery would be comparable with the old air navigation charge, which was a charge on the registration of each aircraft. It made specific reference to the regulatory function of the Authority. The report said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the setting of standards is more a policy function and that enforcement of the standards, as a policing function, has a large degree of public benefit in it.</PARA>
<PARA>Further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . if the industry were required to pay those costs, there would be increased pressure to reduce the level of enforcement of standards. This could result in the level of compliance declining to an unacceptable degree.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, it was saying that one cannot expect the industry to pay for its own policing. It is in the public interest that standards are maintained and therefore the public should bear the cost of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the report was presented to Parliament, the Minister of the day, Minister Morris, gave an unequivocal assurance in the House of Representatives that the Government accepted all the recommendations. The cost recovery program went so well so rapidly that a short while ago the Government said, `We will get this money back from the safety regulatory function. We will charge the industry for it'. The 8,500 certificate of registration holders in this country will have to meet the bill. In the first instance the current cost is about $75m. It will impose a levy on aircraft owners in the next financial year which will start at a level of about $250 for the smallest and lightest aircraft and go up quite substantially. It will be doubled next year and trebled the year after that. This is in total defiance of its stated acceptance of the recommendations of the Bosch inquiry whose report was presented about six or seven years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has produced an enormous reaction in the industry. The industry is on its knees. It simply cannot afford a levy like that. We are not talking about $250 for all aircraft. We are talking about that as the lowest level. Commercial operators, people who are running charter airlines or flying training organisations, simply cannot afford it. The Government should not be under any illusion as to the reaction in the aviation community to this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal body in Australia, the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association of Australia, has made an emphatic statement advising all of its members not to pay the levy. Yesterday the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> contained an article entitled `11,000 air operators may boycott tax'. This very strongly written article, which takes up four columns, goes through the business of how the industry `is furious about being blatantly ripped off by the Government'. The industry cannot afford to be subject to these sorts of irrational moves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basic point, of course, is that the general aviation sector, on which this levy will fall most heavily, simply does not need the CAA. We have reached the stage where that sector of the industry is well able to regulate its own activities. We simply do not need the huge impositions that are being placed on us by this bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Civil Aviation Authority has the gall to claim that 45 per cent of the total amount that will be recovered by way of the safety regulatory levy will come from the airline industry. The airline industry is the reason why the Civil Aviation Authority exists. The industry is its principal customer. If there is any fairness at all, the airline industry should be paying about 98 per cent of the levy, not 45 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it goes further than that. It goes to the certificate of approval holders&mdash;the people who are licensed to perform maintenance all around Australia. Proposals are around that they will pay somewhere between $10,000 and $20,000 a year just to have a workshop. Last week I rang up the financial section of the Civil Aviation Authority. I said, `Look, I am being besieged with calls about your charging practices. Where are we going on this? What is your basis for it?'. To my surprise, the senior officer told me, `Oh, well, we are going to put a levy on those maintenance people because they are not paying any tax at the moment'. I said, `That is astonishing. Do you mean to say that if someone in the industry is not paying tax, he has to be taxed?'. He said, `Oh yes, that is right'. This really is a bizarre way to handle the commercial world. Quite simply, the GA area cannot pay this levy. In my view, it is not going to pay the levy and I think we are in for an enormous fight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 10 minutes left to me I would like to refer to a particular example of the performance of the Civil Aviation Authority. In evidence given before a committee of this Parliament, officers of the CAA have admitted to wasting hundreds of millions of dollars on programs in the last few years. One of the classic examples of that is its ventures into the acquisition of radars. Everything that this Authority has touched in the last few years has been an utter disaster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ATCARDS system, in respect of which the Authority gave a contract to Thomson radar to provide the radars for Perth, Adelaide and Melbourne, was a disaster. The Government and the CAA claim that the way in which the contract was awarded, with subcontractors nominated and Thomson not having total control, led to inefficiencies. In fact, there is some truth in that&mdash;it did lead to part of the problem. But the major part of the problem comes from the professional inadequacies of Thomson-CSF as a radar supplier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everyone in Australia would know of the difficulties that we have had with the Melbourne radar traffic control system. It was never fixed by Thomson; it was fixed by the Civil Aviation Authority itself at further expense, over the contract price, by $5.5m of taxpayers' funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have the RASPP program going&mdash;Cairns, Coolangatta, Gellibrand, Mount Macedon. On this occasion Thomson-CSF, the great favourite, the white-haired son of the CAA, again got the contract. It had total control of this contract from start to finish. Again, it is a disaster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many times in the Senate we have talked about the mechanical problems in Cairns and massive software problems when aircraft disappear. We have had the fatuous explanation from the Minister that it is because of a transponder fault in the aircraft. That is absolute nonsense. It is not only the secondary surveillance radar that is playing up; the software program will not recognise aircraft in certain circumstances. It is a software fault. It is not a transmitting fault in the aircraft itself. Of course, the Cairns program was something like 20 months over time on completion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now we come to the Australian air traffic control system which is a massive thing. My concern with that initially was the fact that the CAA arbitrarily decided that there would be no Australian participation. Having been with this program since it started&mdash;and it has been running for nearly 12 months now&mdash;I am appalled at the way the CAA has taken us back nearly 30 years in accountability with respect to tendering processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might be very well for Mr Baldwin, who was a real estate salesman in New Zealand before he came to Australia, to operate on a one-on-one basis and work out contracts as he goes along, but Australia got away from that 30 years ago. The difficulty that he is in at the present time is that he is not prepared to account for what he has done, largely on his own, with respect to this new contract. He is not prepared at all to follow accepted procedures which provide the transparency in the decision process which enables taxpayers in Australia to know that their money has been properly spent. That is a very serious situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way the CAA went about this was quite surprising. Instead of following the accepted tender procedures laid down by the Department of Administrative Services, it called for a request for information. It contacted six companies only and asked them to submit proposals for a radar system. It eliminated three quite rapidly. The three that were eliminated were Siemens Plessey, Selenia and Raytheon. That left IBM, Thomson and Hughes in the field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CAA eliminated Siemens Plessey, which was the cheapest and probably the most technologically advanced in the field, on the grounds that its air traffic control database system was based on an unproven system; namely, the McDonnell Detweiler software program which is being used in Canada by Hughes. It made no comment to Siemens, before eliminating it, that the program was too high a risk in its judgment. Had it made that comment, Siemens Plessey had off-the-shelf, cheaper software programs which would have fulfilled the requirement in that part of the contract. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because Siemens Plessey was one of the formidable players in the tender, it was eliminated first. That left IBM. The Department told IBM that it was operationally unacceptable, yet begged it to stay in with Thomson and Hughes. To those of us who are interested in this matter, it was never any secret that Thomson from day 1 was the preferred candidate of the CAA. A most elaborate selection system was set up with 25 representatives from the air traffic controllers, 25 technical and engineering people, in five different committees looking at all aspects of the radar selection. I am glad Senator Button is in here because one of those aspects was Australian industry participation. All the recommendations from these committees favoured Hughes above Thomson on technological advancement, reliability, Australian industry content and cost&mdash;on every parameter possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the operation of the CAA was very hard to follow. It allowed people to make other bids and recently in the papers&mdash;I have not yet read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of it but I think it was at the Public Works Committee hearing&mdash;the claims were made that some of the commercially sensitive information was passed to Thomson so that Thomson was in the position that apparently enabled it to revise its bids constantly through the selection program. Clearly, the CAA moved the goal posts as the selection process took place. People who did not agree with the direction that the CAA wanted to take were fired. Of course, it is a matter of public record that the air traffic controllers, the civil air operators, pulled out of the negotiations on the stated grounds of a lack of fairness. That is something to think about&mdash;what do those words `lack of fairness' actually mean in the selection process?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, it is a matter of record that when the proposition was put forward by the CAA to the board of CAA that Thomson be the preferred tenderer, the board was very divided and it was not possible to come to a decision. Then, apparently, the Chief Executive Officer, Mr Baldwin, put on an emotional presentation on the virtues of Thomson and threatened to resign on the spot unless Thomson's bid was accepted by the board. So it came to pass that Thomson became the preferred tenderer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It got to this position purely on a request for information. There was no formal tender proposal, there were no hard and fast specifications defined. The Australian public is faced with the position now that the CAA is sitting down with a preferred tenderer to write an extraordinarily complex tender document with a lot of money tied up in it, under pressure from Thomson saying, `If you do not agree to what we do, your air traffic control system in Sydney and in Brisbane is going to fall over and there are going to be enormous political consequences'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not know what the final cost will be; we do not know what the specifications are going to be. It is a quite extraordinary procedure for a country with the standards of public accountability of Australia to be in. I have been involved in this Parliament for quite a number of years now. I have a great interest in defence and I have followed defence contracting very closely. We are talking about a civil aviation contract of somewhere around $150m to $200m. In defence contracts, things like the Collins class submarines, the Anzac ships, you are looking at a magnitude beyond that; you are looking at $2.5 billion, $3.5 billion or $4.5 billion&mdash;many times the size of this. In the tendering processes that I have been associated with or have observed, I have seen intense competition in defence. There are very big prizes of the order of billions of dollars to the successful tenderer. I have never in my life heard a word of criticism about the integrity of the selection process in defence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this contract of the Civil Aviation Authority, I have to say that the industry is rife with rumours questioning the integrity of the CAA in the selection process. I do not know whether they are true or false, but it is my intention to use this Parliament to bring the CAA to account for this. It has an obligation to the Australian community to prove those rumours either true or false, because there is expenditure there of some hundreds of millions of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the technical capabilities of the preferred tenderer, Thomson-CSF, we see a history of failure in performance, not only in Australia but all around the world. We see this doubt as to how the selection committee ever came to the decision it did in the face of contrary advice from all its technical committees. There are so many questions to this that have to be answered. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset, in speaking to this Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill 1992, I formally move the amendment standing in my name, which has been duly circulated. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At end of motion, add ", but the Senate regrets the Government's failure to take advantage of the opportunity provided by this Bill to introduce more extensive changes to customs and excise legislation, including:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)abolishing the excise duty on fuel, including diesel fuel; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)reducing other customs and excise and similar taxation burdens on business by adopting proposals such as those contained in the Coalition's `Fightback' program".</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to the nature of the Bill first. This is a Bill which has three parts to it: first, the electronic lodgment of information concerning imported goods; secondly, the system dealing with advance arrival reporting; and thirdly, the diesel fuel rebate scheme. To address the question of electronic lodgment, this Bill has, in fact, been referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology to be dealt with as a consideration of the Bill, and to report back. I would suggest that the electronic lodgment process, and the way it is arrived at, would be one of the things that would be looked at by that Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill proposes to amend the Customs Act by providing the legislative framework for the electronic transmission by the Australian Customs Service of information concerning imported goods; and secondly, the electronic lodgment of import entries with respect to those goods. The proposed amendments are similar to those supported by the coalition in 1990, which created the exit system. Indeed, the electronic import lodgment scheme to be introduced is designed to complement that existing system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems is the way in which this has been done. I understand the Bill was available in draft form at the end of last year but, more particularly, the scheme was actually introduced prior to the legislation being introduced. It became effective in September last year, and it became effective by way of an agreement that was entered into between agents and the Australian Customs Service. In the Estimates hearings, we heard some evidence of coercion to the signing of those agreements. Mr Miller, an in-house lawyer with the Customs Service, admitted that it was a document&mdash;that is, the agreement document&mdash;that was biased in favour of the Customs Service because, to put it in his terms, he said, `The Customs Service was the client'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is that this legislation provides the legislative base that will really authorise the Australian Customs Service to enter into a subsequent agreement, and it is to be hoped that there will be more consultation, and a better feeling of fairness about the entering into of the fresh agreement. It is quite important to put on the record that we still have not got an adequate answer, firstly as to why the legislation, being in draft form in December, was not made available more widely to the industry for consultation, and, secondly, why the scheme was implemented in September prior to the legislation being put in place, and why there was such a long delay between the implementation of the scheme and the introduction of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been suggested that one of those reasons could be that the relevant Minister, the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs, Mr Beddall, in fact made an undertaking to certain parts of the industry that the scheme would be up and running by September, and the Customs Service simply went out to find a way and a means of implementing the system without legislative authority. It is a dangerous precedent to set, and it is one that should be noted by the Senate, and something that we would hope would not recur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part of the Bill deals with advance arrival reporting. Again, it is an amendment to the Customs Act 1901 and it relates to the advance reporting regime for ships and aircraft, their passengers, cargo and crew. The proposals are along the lines of amendments passed by the Parliament, again in 1990, and are designed to enhance the existing advance reporting provisions. At present aircraft and ships are required to provide the Customs Service with a report giving details of the cargo on board, the number and names of crew, and the number of passengers being carried. The screening and risk assessment of this information and subsequent action are among the key methods by which the Australian Customs Service meets its community protection obligations, particularly in regard to the importation of narcotics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments to the legislation in 1990 provided for the prescribed information to be reported via computer prior to the arrival of the aircraft or ship at the first port of call. Reports containing similar information continue to be conveyed by hand to Customs officers upon arrival at the vessel's subsequent ports. The Bill extends the current procedures to provide for the advance reporting of prescribed information at ports of call. The advance reporting system has been successful, in our opinion, in allowing risk management and other checks to be completed before the vessel arrives at the port. A more efficient system of processing crew, the early identification and better targeting of risk and the early availability of cargo have been key factors in the Australian Customs Service decision to extend the advance reporting mechanism to all ports of call for an aircraft or a ship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third part of the Bill relates to the diesel fuel rebate scheme. It is here that I think it is important to point out that this is again only a bandaid measure introduced by the Government. The detailed policies outlined in our Fightback package, which are going to give so much more benefit to Australian industry in the ability to create jobs, provide the better way to proceed. Certainly we will not be opposing the bandaid measures that the Government is introducing but we take the opportunity to point out that our Fightback package is so much better and indeed offers many more opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at this country as a whole, one could say it has been penalised by the tyranny of distance, to borrow Geoffrey Blainey's phrase, yet it is in this area that the Government has imposed a tax upon the means of transporting goods and services across Australia&mdash;namely, on fuel. Clearly, by abolishing the fuel excise on all petroleum products, including diesel, we will see a huge benefit to the Australian population. In our Fightback package we outlined the seven taxes which we will abolish. Those seven taxes include not only the fuel excise tax but tariff tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Long since have I abolished the word `protection' from my lexicon. It is a warm, fuzzy word that somehow says we are supposed to be doing something warm and nice. In fact, it is a tax like any other tax, which is simply designed to penalise one group of people by taxing them and to take that money and pay it to another group of people because the Government believes that they are somehow special. Then it has to explain to the rest of the people in Australia why they are not quite so special and they do not get those advantages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The much better way is to have fair access to all the resources in Australia, both capital and human, being competed for fairly by all industry. That is the philosophy behind our policy to abolish tariff tax, in the sense that it will be reduced to negligible levels of 0 to 5 per cent. That will be done hand in hand with the abolition of the other costs that are imposed upon business. We will be abolishing $20 billion worth of taxes all-up. That will make business much more able to compete, particularly in the export line. At the moment we are held back because of the gross taxing on inputs that is currently the state of the Government's policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So although we do not oppose this Bill&mdash;indeed, it has been referred to the Friday committee for consideration&mdash;we will move the amendment that I outlined at the beginning of my presentation, which simply says to the Government, `Your policies are lacking; they are simply not good enough. The sooner we can have an election and see the implementation of the Fightback package, the better this country will be'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate today is debating the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill 1992. The Bill proposes amendments in three areas: first, to facilitate the electronic lodgment of import documentation; secondly, to broaden the advance reporting regime for imported cargo; and, thirdly, to alter the administration of the diesel fuel rebate scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first matter is to place in the principal Act the provisions which relate to the option of electronically lodging import entries with Customs. I think the term `option' is important, because Customs agents acting for importers have the option to use it or not. This COMPILE system is currently operating under regulation and is simply being put into primary legislation. A principal or agent wishing to import goods utilising the more efficient electronic lodgment system has to sign a user agreement governing the operation of the electronic system. The user simply fills in the requisite electronic documentation, then electronically lodges this with Customs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A similar system which deals with exports, the so-called EXIT system, was supported by the Democrats in 1990. The new COMPILE system reduces the cost of lodging import entries and reduces normal clearance times from four hours to a few minutes and, on that point alone, is surely to be commended. The administration costs of Customs are also reduced. This measure is a minor improvement in the efficiency of the transport chain that is a small element of micro-reform and will help in marginally reducing the massive transport costs which are unavoidable in a country as large as ours. They may be unavoidable in substance, but certainly we can push for greater improvements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had representations from a Melbourne customs broker who has some severe difficulties with this system, especially the manner in which Customs has instituted the current user agreements. He has opposed this system on the basis that it imposes unfair burdens on users and it creates potential legal liability in respect of seeking information which is not known to the broker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter was discussed through my office with a Customs official who pointed out that the manual system which preceded the electronic COMPILE system also contained the questions which were objected to and that, if these were not satisfactorily answered, the goods would not be cleared by Customs under the former arrangements. It is clear that to run an effective system of enforcing the prohibition of certain imports, such as weapons, drugs and items subject to quarantine, somebody has to take the legal responsibility for declaring what the cargo is. As such, the Democrats understand that Customs is simply safeguarding the public interest. As I understand it, a new user agreement will be prepared when this Bill passes. I do hope that the dispute between the broker and Customs can then be amicably settled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second area concerns the advance reporting regime. Under this system, Customs is notified of goods which will arrive before they enter the country. This system has a dual purpose: it allows the fast clearance of goods which are routine and it allows better assessment of risk in respect of prohibited imports. Currently, the system does not require specification of the actual items to be unloaded at each particular port or airport, nor a report on the passengers and crew of aircraft. The Bill proposes that these now be mandatory, and the Democrats welcome that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Customs Brokers Council has made some representations to the Democrats about the optional port lodgment system. In particular, there appears to have been an agreed process under way with the industry, which may now have been circumvented or at least cut short. To examine this matter, the Democrats agree with the reference of the Bill to a legislative committee on Friday to take evidence on that matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 12 imposes an obligation on pilots, shipmasters and/or owners of the aircraft or ships to answer questions relating to the craft's cargo, crew, passengers, stores and voyage. This has been highlighted by the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee as containing a reversal of the onus of proof. However, it is hard to see how Customs can operate effectively without the power to require this information. The enhanced information requirements can only assist Customs in its statutory function of the prevention of illegal imports and so, on balance, the Democrats support this provision also. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final matter in the Bill is a proposal to reform the diesel fuel rebate scheme. The diesel fuel rebate scheme provides refunds of fuel excise or duty paid on diesel fuel purchased for specific off-road uses in mining operations, primary production, residential premises, hospitals, nursing homes and aged people's homes. All excise paid by primary producers is refunded; about 90 per cent is refunded for mining operations and about two-thirds for other uses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill proposes to introduce new administration arrangements for the scheme involving a self-assessment system&mdash;for example, minimal initial checking for rebate claims&mdash;and a much increased system of audits to verify subsequently the accuracy of the initial claim. These changes arose from a report by the Auditor-General suggesting them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats will not be supporting the Opposition's second reading amendment. The Democrats believe that the benefits to be gained from abolishing the excise on fossil fuels is misguided because the benefits will be short term. In the long term, ways and means must be found for research on and development of alternative fuels. Simply to provide an incentive for people to use more of our dwindling fossil fuel supplies is a short term view on long term ecological sustainability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part of the resolution proposed by the Opposition amongst other things seeks a further reduction in customs duties. That requires a lot more consideration. The Australian Democrats would like to see a careful assessment of the damage done to Australian industries and Australian jobs before we endorse an across-the-board reduction of customs duties. The Democrats will be supporting the Government's Bill without further amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to participate in the debate on the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill 1992. I support the move in respect of the excise rebate on diesel fuel by which the Government intends to change the method of application for the rebate. Until now&mdash;I think since this Government came to power&mdash;excise on diesel fuel has been paid and users have to apply for a rebate with a standard form when they have used a certain quantity or after some time has elapsed. The previous system involved a fuel excise exemption certificate, which was used, I believe, from 1956 or 1957. Then one simply quoted the exemption certificate number and was not charged the diesel fuel excise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government changed that system in 1983-84 because it believed that there were too many fuel excise exemptions being claimed that were not correct or legal to claim. When claiming under the present system, a claim form accompanied by invoices is sent to the Collector of Customs and then there is a wait of three or four or five weeks&mdash;the Government seems to be going for money in the coffers when it sends the rebate. I believe the old system was quite a sloppy system, if I can use that term, by which to apply because it meant a lot of unnecessary paperwork. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With modern accounting practices, fuel companies and others do not issue too much in the way of paperwork. They issue just a single invoice, which has to be sent with the application for a fuel rebate, collectively, with all the other invoices. It is up to the applicant to calculate what fuel was used on public roads and what was used off roads, whether on a farm or a mine or whatever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the proposed new system, as I understand it, one simply fills in a claim form and then one is subject to an audit if the Customs department sees fit to do so. People keep their own invoices and supporting documents in a file. Of course, people were subject to audits previously. It seemed to be the custom that a representative of the fuel excise section would arrive on the place at least once every 12 months or so to go through invoices, purchases and what have you. The auditor also asked about any change of circumstances or any extra vehicles using diesel that may have been on public roads. To my knowledge, that practice has diminished or disappeared altogether in the last three or four years, unless the department thinks my company is doing the right thing. I do not know whether that is the fact or whether the inspectors were taken off the road on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the system of simply applying and keeping your own records will be far more efficient. Under the other system, one had to send the invoices away to support the claim but they were never sent back. If claims were lost one had to get a certified copy and that used to create problems. The best idea was to keep photocopies of the originals that were sent in, but those photocopies were not necessarily certified. I believe that the system proposed by the amendment in this Bill is a move in the right direction. It will cut down a lot of unnecessary paperwork. Whether we like it or not, substantiation is with us now for taxation as well as other areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a practical user of diesel fuel in off-road situations, I welcome the measure because I believe it will be far more efficient. If an invoice is missing at the end of the month, there is no need to run around looking for it. One can apply for it in good time while waiting for an audit. The suppliers, as I have said before, have a tendency to give out only one invoice which gets left somewhere and cannot be found when the fuel is delivered. I repeat that the proposed amendment relating to the fuel excise rebate scheme is one of the measures that I welcome in this Bill. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I refer to Senator Richardson's statement that he cleared his call to the President of the Marshall Islands with the Minister before he made that call and I ask: did the Minister in fact advise Senator Richardson that it would be in order for him to contact the President of the Marshall Islands to seek advantage for a friend being prosecuted for a forgery offence under the laws of the Marshall Islands, and in exactly what terms did the Minister authorise the call?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1785" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very happy to explain the circumstances of that particular conversation. It was not a matter of Senator Richardson `clearing' anything with me. The language that he used in his press statement, just for the record, was `after checking with. . . ' me `to ensure that. . . ' he `was not acting improperly'. That was the context in which Senator Richardson raised the matter with me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to my recollection, he rang me on Friday, 3 April and explained the situation in which his relative by marriage found himself in the Marshall Islands. He told me that he had been asked by the lawyer for Mr Symons to ring the President of the Marshall Islands and ask that Mr Symons's passport not be withheld, not to ask for the charges against him to be dropped.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against that background Senator Richardson asked me whether there was any Foreign Affairs protocol type reason why he should not do this and whether there was any precedent for this sort of situation. My reply was as follows: this was a very unusual situation which I had not previously encountered, and I was unaware of any precedent; but, bearing in mind the highly personalised character of politics and administration in small island countries, it was less odd than it would be elsewhere to contact the President directly. I interpolate at this point that the Marshall Islands is a very small island country of some 40,000 people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I went on to say that, if all that Senator Richardson was proposing to ask was that Mr Symons's passport not be withheld so that he could prepare his defence, it seemed to me to be okay to make a representation seeking, in effect, the exercise of an executive or prosecutorial discretion on this kind of matter. I went on to say that it would be a much more sensitive matter to go in any way into the merits of the case: I understood that Senator Richardson himself had no intention of making any suggestion that the charges be dropped and I thought that was wise. I said finally that I did not see any objection in principle to his making the call, as long as he did not hold himself out in doing so to be acting on behalf of the Australian Government, which again I understood that he had no intention of doing.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a supplementary question. Is there not an obvious risk in contacting the head of state of a small island state that he may well interpret that as an attempt by a senior Minister of the Australian Government to interfere in the judicial process of his island state?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Richardson made it perfectly clear, as he said in his statement, that he was making a call not in any capacity as a Minister representing or purporting to represent the Government, and he was quite explicit and articulate about that. Moreover, the question in issue was whether the executive, the prosecution, would ask for or continue to ask for the passport to be withheld, rather than any question going to the merits of the case as determined by the court itself. Under those circumstances, although the situation was an unusual one, in the context which I have described, I thought it was not improper for the approach to be made.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TITLE>Burma</TITLE>
<QUESTION PAGE="1786" SPEAKER="Schacht Sen C.C." NAMEID="4J4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. What is the Government's assessment of the significance of the replacement of the Chairman of the Burmese State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), Senior General Saw Maung, by General Than Shwe? In particular, what is the significance of the reported decisions by the Burmese Government to release some political prisoners and take other measures in the human rights area, including the possibility of allowing Daw Aung San Suu Kyi to meet again with her husband and children?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1786" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Schacht has intimated and as honourable senators will know, late last week General Than Shwe was appointed Chairman of the SLORC and, in doing so, replaced General Saw Maung who was, according to the Burmese authorities, stepping down `temporarily' due to health reasons. Saw Maung is, in fact, known to have been ill for an extended period. General Than Shwe, the new head of SLORC, has been influential in the Burmese regime for some time. He was recently appointed Minister for Defence. As he is a protege of Ne Win, who is widely believed to be still the dominant force in Burmese politics, it does seem unlikely that there will be any major policy changes in Burma in the foreseeable future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, since the appointment the Burmese authorities have made several announcements indicating some degree of political liberalisation. These are decisions, first of all, to release a total of 27 political prisoners, including the former Prime Minister, U Nu, with other releases to follow; secondly, a decision that the State Law and Order Restoration Council is to meet with representatives of the remaining political parties within two months and to convene the national convention within six months; and, thirdly, as Senator Schacht said, to permit Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's family to visit her in Rangoon where she is being detained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Government certainly takes some encouragement from these announcements and we look to the speedy implementation of these decisions. The announcements are significant in that SLORC has now admitted for the first time that it holds political prisoners, and the proposed meeting between SLORC and the political parties represents another change of policy because, until now, SLORC had not identified any time frame at all for this further process.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there is still a long way to go to restore democratic process in Burma.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A measure of SLORC's commitment to these decisions would be the immediate and unconditional release of all political prisoners, of which we estimate there to be some 2,000 still in custody. These include Daw Aung San Suu Kyi herself, of course, and other leaders of the National League for Democracy, who could play a very significant role in the process of national reconciliation in the transition to a modern democratic state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity again to call on behalf of the Australian Government for the earliest transfer of power to a democratically elected government and for respect for universally accepted principles of human rights. It is the case that Burma's regime remains one of the most repressive in the world. We did have a further encouraging development yesterday with Burma and Bangladesh signing an agreement for the repatriation of the Rohingya refugees. That situation has been, of course, a source of concern to us all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a further report suggesting today that the Burma Army has suspended its attack against the Karen National Union forces near the Thai-Burma border. Again, we hope that that represents a change of policy and not just some cosmetic step designed to take some international heat off. In that respect, the approach of the monsoon season and the failure so far of the Burmese Army's efforts to capture the Karen capital of Manerplaw may have been factors in the reported suspension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Summing all that up, the Government will continue to follow very closely developments in Burma. We do remain very concerned about the situation there. We had been over recent weeks increasing our diplomatic activity to explore the possibility of a full scale UN-endorsed arms embargo against Burma and had been looking again at the question of economic sanctions. I have been having quite extensive discussions on those subjects, particularly in China, which remains the most influential country in this respect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is certainly not time, in our judgment, to review the measures we have already taken to show Australia's disapproval of political repression but, in all the circumstances, we do think it appropriate to hold for the moment any further diplomatic action to endeavour to make a better judgment as to just how seriously these current developments do constitute a watershed or whether, rather, they are simply cosmetic.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs aware of the difficulties confronted by members of many ethnic communities in securing their proper rights as consumers? Given that the language barrier may be a significant factor in those difficulties, especially for older migrants, what steps is the Government taking to remedy the situation?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1787" SPEAKER="Tate Sen The Hon M.C." NAMEID="NJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="TAS" MINISTERIAL="JUSTICE AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I am aware of the difficulties faced by some members of Australia's ethnic communities in asserting their rights as consumers&mdash;first of all, understanding what rights they may have and then, of course, having the confidence to assert those rights if they do not have English as a first language and are not very proficient at it. For that reason, I have been engaged for the last year or so in undertaking programs with various ethnic communities, mainly using the media which are read or listened to by those communities, in order to help them understand the rights that they have as consumers and to ensure that they are not intimidated or, out of simple ignorance of their rights, do not exercise the rights that they have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Several instances have been brought to the attention of this chamber. For example, elderly immigrant couples not particularly proficient at English are asked by banks and other financial institutions to act as guarantors for their children's business ventures. They do not fully understand the situation. They are then called upon to make that guarantee have some substance if the business collapses. They do not know who to turn to in order to assert that they were led into an unconscionable situation by the financial institution. That is just one instance of many.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to ordinary matters&mdash;such as defective or unsafe products which cause an injury, or services which are not provided or, if provided, turn out to be shoddy&mdash;they need to know who to turn to in order to assert their rights as consumers. For that reason, there has been a series of multicultural meetings with various ethnic groups and communities&mdash;Arabic, Greek, Italian, Spanish, Chinese, Vietnamese, Serbian, Macedonian, Turkish, Croatian. I have spoken to them all in Melbourne and Sydney at various launches. These meetings have had the full support of the ethnic press, SBS and public affairs radio. We believe that we are getting the message across in helping these communities exercise their rights alongside other Australian consumers.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is undeniable that members of this community have been subject to quite severe discrimination, particularly regarding their ability to travel outside Syria. The Australian Government, along with other countries, has taken a very consistent and firm stance with respect to this issue. We have been making direct representations to the Syrian authorities through our Embassy in Damascus for several years, and these issues were raised directly by my predecessor, Mr Hayden, during his visits in 1984 and 1988. I have had occasion, of course, to raise the issue also with the Syrian Ambassador here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision to lift restrictions on travel means that, at least in theory, whole Syrian Jewish families should now have the right to travel abroad, as do members of all other Syrian communities. The limit on family travel has been a particularly unfortunate restriction on human rights. We will have to monitor closely whether in practice whole Jewish families will now be able to leave Syria together. It is to be acknowledged that Syrian Jews, like all Syrians, are still prohibited from travelling to Israel.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that Senator Reynolds has taken a very keen interest in community legal centres. Indeed, I understand that in Townsville recently a community legal centre was established, largely at her prompting. If I heard her correctly, she spoke of a lawyer dominated legal system. However, it is hard to conceive of one that did not have a strong presence of lawyers. It is important that that sort of language does not lead to a stereotyping or caricaturing of lawyers who, certainly in regard to community legal centres, provide at least $2m worth of voluntary work which helps supplement the work of those centres.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that way, together with the dedicated work of those who are full time workers with community legal centres, they provide a very good structure of accessible legal advice to those who otherwise might not get it through either financial disadvantage or being a little overawed about going into a lawyer's office. Such people find that they can freely, and in a friendly and accessible way, enter CLCs to get the initial advice, at least, that they require concerning a legal problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because community legal centres are such an important part of the network of legal advice available to Australians, in the last Budget the Federal Government increased the money available to them from $2.7m to $5.2m in the last financial year. Increases of about half a million dollars are intended in each of the two following financial years. This gives an indication of the real worth that we see in the work of community legal centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, we wanted to see such centres moved out of their genesis in the inner cities, such as Footscray or Redfern, into regional, country and provincial areas of Australia. That is being achieved, even in some capitals that were previously neglected. I understand that Senator Collins officiated at the opening of a community legal centre in Darwin recently; as I did in Devonport in north-west Tasmania last week. We want to see these community legal centres being available to all Australians. I am delighted to tell Senator Reynolds that that is being effected at the moment.

The answer to that question is that there is nothing proposed that would cause this reaction. What we have here is the practice of the big lie technique&mdash;the practice of building a huge emotional circus and pretending that something is happening that is not happening. Unfortunately, a number of people have fallen victim to the lies that are being told.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The notice that has been circulated by Mr Howard is a notice for a rally which is apparently sponsored by him and the Small Business Association of Australia against the independent contractors Bill. The first defect is in the title of this notice. There is no such Bill in existence. I have announced an intention to bring a Bill before the Senate, but at this stage the consultations associated with the Bill have not been concluded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This notice is based on the big lie technique. There are essentially four lies being propounded. The first lie is that housing costs will increase by between 15 and 25 per cent. The second lie is that this alleged Bill will regulate subcontractors by awards of the Industrial Relations Commission. The third lie is that it will force all subcontractors in the housing industry into trade unions. Those lies are all absolutely wrong. The most outrageous of those three lies is the housing industry lie. I have asked organisations associated with the housing industry that have made these allegations to produce some evidence. They have not been able to do so, and they simply cannot because their allegations are not based on any foundation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth big lie is the lie of omission&mdash;not telling the truth&mdash;when one knows something else to exist that is relevant to the circumstances and one omits to actually mention it. The fourth big lie is that the legislation that I am proposing to introduce into the Senate is quite similar to legislation that applies in New South Wales which was introduced in the last rework for the New South Wales industrial relations Bill by the Greiner Government. I would have thought that that is a relevant fact that Mr Howard might have mentioned in his circular. He did not do so. That goes to his credibility as `Honest John' in terms of telling the truth about these circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said that I propose to introduce legislation that enables the Industrial Relations Commission to have the power to determine what class of employee or worker should be engaged in particular work, whether it should be those covered by awards or those working on independent contract. This is an area of industrial dispute in industrial relations. The Commission does not have the power to prevent or settle those issues of industrial dispute as the Constitution of this country enjoins it to. It seems to me entirely appropriate to clothe the Commission with the power to settle those disputes and to do so with the guidelines that I have suggested of efficiency, custom and practice to guide its mind when it approaches those problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also under the legislation that I propose to introduce, the Commission would have the power to set aside contracts which are harsh and unconscionable, upon application by a so-called contractor, and then direct the parties to renegotiate or impose new terms. I would like to know who will stand up here in the Senate and defend harsh and unconscionable contracts. If there are contracts of that character, should not those who are victims of them have recourse to some means by which they can be settled? If someone thinks that this is an academic question, I can show that person outworkers in the clothing industry&mdash;mostly migrant women working away in their own homes&mdash;who are victims of harsh and unconscionable contracts and who, in the present circumstances, have no recourse to deal with those employment situations they are cast into by force of circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The `anti' campaign depends on misrepresentation and distortion. It is a political attempt to whip up hysteria on this subject. Many people who have been duped by it confess to me when I talk to them that they do not know the terms of the Bill; that is because there is no Bill. When I discuss it with them, they are enlightened and they change their attitude to a considerable extent. Therefore, I caution industry and employer associations not to be gulled, not to be used by John Howard's political agenda, but to talk to the Government about exactly what is intended and ascertain for themselves the facts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many employer organisations and industries have done so.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that point there should have been an acknowledgment that a division was required, and therefore the sitting of the Senate should have been suspended at that point.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday I gave an undertaking to Senator Crowley to provide her with additional information in relation to the lifting of bans on Mr Martin Vinnicombe, and I will provide that information now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 24 April 1992, the Federal Court ordered that Martin Vinnicombe's action be dismissed, with no order as to costs, because the parties agreed to abide by a decision of the court-appointed referee. The outcome of this decision is that the parties to the agreement would do all things necessary to cause Mr Vinnicombe to be issued a professional licence. The Government will abide by the referee's decision. This will require that Mr Vinnicombe be issued a valid clearance from the Australian Cycling Federation; return a negative drug test conducted by the Australian Sports Drug Agency; make a valid application for a professional licence and then have that licence endorsed by the Australian Professional Cycling Council for international competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government will not interfere in this process, a process which has commenced. However, the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) understands that the process has been complicated by the fact that the New South Wales League of Wheelmen, the State professional cycling body which was not party to the mediation process, has indicated that it will not issue Mr Vinnicombe with a State licence. It is unclear whether the APCC can issue a valid international licence without the cooperation of the State league. The Minister has asked that this process be examined and I on her behalf will report this to the Senate further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, I wish to make it clear that there is no doubt about Mr Vinnicombe's test result. As I said yesterday, it was positive. The Federal Court ruling relied on an opinion by the appointed mediator, the Hon. Bob Ellicott, QC, which stated that Mr Vinnicombe had taken the anabolic steroid called stanozolol. In fact, Mr Vinnicombe admitted this in a statement to Mr Ellicott. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The view of the Government is still that Martin Vinnicombe, by administering to himself a banned anabolic steroid, is in breach of the Australian Sports Commission's doping policy. Mr Vinnicombe is no longer a member of the Australian amateur cycling body known as the ACF. Nevertheless, the ACF's position continues to accord with the ASC's doping policy in that the ACF will not consider an application from Mr Vinnicombe for membership of the ACF until two years has elapsed from the date of Mr Vinnicombe's sample collection. As far as the ASC is concerned, Mr Vinnicombe will be ineligible for any form of financial assistance for two years from the date of the sample collection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, as I explained yesterday to the Senate, the Government will be moving quickly to ensure that in future individuals who cheat by taking performance enhancing drugs cannot escape sanctions on technicalities. This will require amendments to the ASDA legislation. As I advised the Senate yesterday, the Government is examining that matter now. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The necessity to retain the tariff on sugar imports at its current level of $76 a tonne and to postpone any further reduction until a successful conclusion is reached in the GATT Uruguay round.</PARA>
<PARA>I move this motion today because the future of Australia's sugar industry is indeed a matter of urgency. The industry requires our urgent action now, not in the year 2000, because Australia's sugar industry will become bankrupt without continued protection for the 23 per cent of its production which is consumed domestically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know why the industry is in this position. A combination of drought&mdash;which has reduced domestic sugar production&mdash;and low world prices has severely reduced the operating surplus of the average sugar farm. In asking for the retention of the current tariff rate, canegrowers are asking for a subsidy that accounts for about 40 per cent of the average cane farmer's cash flow and probably well over half of his or her profits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking survival. We are talking urgent survival&mdash;survival of an industry and survival of the towns and communities which depend on this industry. We are, in fact, asking Australia's seven million households to pay about $8.50 a year towards the survival of the sugar industry&mdash;$8.50 towards the maintenance of sugar growers' jobs, $8.50 towards the retention of thousands of jobs in the communities which depend on the sugar industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ask the people of Mackay in Queensland, the people of Ayr or the people of Bundaberg whether they are willing to pay this small price. Of course they are, and so is the rest of Australia. Just ask the people who voted recently in Wills, and who told both the Government and the Opposition what they think about being treated as guinea pigs on the altar of world trade reform. How can it possibly be in the national interest to threaten the livelihood of Australia's 6,500 canegrowers and their families and their surrounding communities which rely on them? That is real job creation for you, and in a time of massive unemployment to boot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent study by a Queensland university economist, Professor Rod Jensen, reveals that every $1m spent on locally made goods generates almost 30 full time jobs for a year. He estimates that Australia's $50,000m import bill could create more than a million jobs if spent on local products not imports. The same $1m order for local goods also creates a $500,000 bonus for State and Federal governments. We are moving in a contrary and contradictory direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us take a moment to look at the responses of both the coalition and the Government to the well publicised plight of canegrowers. From the Liberal Party we see absolute rigidity and from the Labor Party we see hypocritical selectivity. Dr Hewson says, `Well, I can explain all of this away. It is the Government's fault that the necessary micro-economic reform hasn't been carried out'. Maybe that is true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How ridiculous then to go ahead and vote to destroy the sugar industry as a consequence. Surely, the sensible and reasonable thing for the Liberal Party to do would be to say, `We acknowledge that sugar is Australia's second most valuable crop after wheat. We acknowledge that it contributes about $1 billion a year to crop exports. We in the Liberal Party think it could do better with the sort of assistance we intend to put in place but, in the meantime, we want the sugar industry to survive so that when we win government and put these other reforms in place we will have this key industry in a position to move in the area of boosting exports'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do we see from Dr Hewson, from Mr Tim Fischer, from Senator Ian Macdonald and from others who represent sugar constituencies? We see absolute rigidity. We see absolutely blinkered, absolutely black and white&mdash;must have zero tariffs, must have no exemptions&mdash;blanket rules for all situations. I can tell Dr Hewson that life is not like that. Real life requires flexibility. It requires assessment of individual differences and individual needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, far from creating the ideal free trade, zero tariff world it could be argued&mdash;as Mr Joe Farley of the Australian Canefarmers Association has argued&mdash;that Dr Hewson is in fact hindering world trade reform because of his constant stubborn reiteration of zero tariffs by the year 2000. What a perfect inducement that is for Europeans to sit back and do nothing to reduce their massive protective structure for the next eight years because they know that by the year 2000, under a coalition government, we will still be proceeding with scorched earth policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What of the position of Liberal members who represent sugar constituencies? Last year in a debate similar to this one Senator Ian Macdonald from Queensland said that he was the only one in this chamber whose livelihood has depended on the returns gained by the sugar industry. He said that he supports this industry and that he will be a credible voice in a coalition Cabinet to make sure that this important industry for north Queensland will be encouraged and enhanced. He talked about the innate ability of sugar producers to create wealth for Australia. Yet Senator Macdonald is not here; he has been totally silent on this issue. He has been promoted to the shadow Ministry, for which we congratulate him, but his success must not be at the cost of the Queensland and the Australian sugar industry&mdash;his constituency's major industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Macdonald and the Liberal Party vote in rigid uniformity against the urgent and special needs of the sugar industry, there will be half as many sugar growers left to benefit from the touted assistance of the structural reforms which the Liberal Party proposes. What great forward planning. Those in the Opposition are saying, `We will help to destroy you now, but when we come into government we will do wonderful things to assist you'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That leads me to another component in the flawed arguments of the coalition with respect to how canegrowers will benefit from the Fightback package. Mr Tim Fischer bases his claim mainly on the fact that canegrowers will have lower fuel costs as a result of the replacement of the fuel excise with the 15 per cent goods and services tax, but lower fuel prices will go nowhere near covering the loss of the present subsidy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I turn to the response of the Labor Party, I say to those listening to this debate that there are no National Party members on the speakers list or present here in the chamber. In fact, the Opposition has failed to provide a speaker for its second speaking position. I think we have to ask what this signifies. Will the National Party members avoid this vote or will they put their vote where their mouths have been recently?  Unfortunately, that is what rigid party politics does to individuals. Where are those who, in their hearts and minds, support a halt in tariff phase-outs for the sugar industry? The bottom line in this debate is that the survival of the coalition is more important than the survival of the sugar industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party, in an example of absolute selectivity, will introduce into the Senate this week amendments to the Customs Act to impose a $12,000 tariff on second-hand motor vehicles from Japan to correct a `distortion', a `distortion' in trade disadvantaging Australian industry. So it is okay to do something for cars, but it is not okay to do anything for sugar. Sugar growers are entitled to ask `Why not?' and `What criteria are being used?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where does GATT feature in this?  Both western Europe and the United States protect their motor industries via quotas. They do not call them quotas, but `voluntary restraints'. Why can we not call them that? Where does the Labor Party in Queensland stand? Mr Goss said that he would not tolerate reduced tariff protection, but what has he done? He has done nothing. It is all parochial talk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Canegrowers do not want indefinite tariff support. They want urgent recognition of their special circumstances&mdash;their contribution to Australia's future. Let us not forget that this Government and Opposition changed the rules on canegrowers just last year. All the sugar industry wants is a fair go in order to survive and to contribute. We in the Australian Democrats believe that people should not pull their houses down before they have made arrangements to live elsewhere. We believe that canegrowers are entitled to that fair go. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating an urgency motion moved by the Australian Democrats on tariff reform in the sugar industry. There ought to be a recognition in this debate that, while Australia is an island, it is part of the international world trading community. In that world we are faced with the formation of trading blocs and the locking out of markets of most efficient traders. Australia is an efficient grower of wheat, wool and sugarcane, and it is an efficient producer of iron ore, coal, alumina, gold and a whole range of agricultural and mineral commodities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue here is: how do we penetrate markets that are closing off or are resistant to the most efficient producer and are heavily subsidised themselves? Can we as a small country in a large world, facing massive trading blocs, outsubsidise or outprotect particular commodities and therefore beat the United States and northern Europe? We do not have the capacity. We have to change the nature of the game by negotiating the removal of subsidies elsewhere and by opening up for our rural producers the closed markets in the European Community and elsewhere. That is the way in which we have to compete and change the nature of the game. We have done that by enlisting the support of other nations of medium and small size like our own in the Cairns Group to form an effective lobby against the giant superpowers in Europe and North America which lock us out of their markets. The Cairns Group has achieved a very important success in a difficult area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the context of those remarks, let us come to the issue of tariff protection. In the economic statement delivered on 12 March the Government declared what the regime will be for us in reducing tariff protection. The objective of that statement was to recognise the reality. As an exporter of raw materials in agriculture and raw bulk materials in minerals, we have not succeeded in transforming our economy from simply a mine and a farm to a manufacturing economy. That is because many of our industries languished behind tariff protection, grew fat, did not face world competition, were not competitive and lost markets overseas as a result of that lack of competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are facts that have to be faced up to by governments; they are not issues that necessarily have to be faced up to by minority parties which never expect to be in government. They are ones that the Government has to face up to. Last year's economic statement on 12 March did that. In the midst of announcing changes to tariff protection throughout the economy, we also announced a phase down in tariffs on sugar from $76 per tonne to $55 per tonne, effective from 1 July this year. We did not just do that. To just do that and leave it would be not to recognise that input costs and other considerations about seasonality and corrupt international markets have to be considered as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then commissioned a longer term study into the whole of the sugar industry. It led to a final report of the Industry Commission, which will be released today. It is on the basis of the findings of that report on the situation in world markets and how we are moving to balance our needs against world trends that the Government will make its final decisions. It will do so in consultation with the rural community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the chairmanship of Mr Brian Courtice, the industry committee, based on rural Australia, is interviewing and receiving submissions about the future of the sugar industry. We have a clear objective of our role in the world, how we should trade with our trading partners, how we should balance the interests of industry, how we should change this country from a quarry and a farm to a manufacturing entity and how we should succeed in doing that realistically. It is a clear goal and a monitoring mechanism to adjust if necessary. That is our position as a government. I suggest it is a responsible position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What makes this debate have almost greater piquancy than any other that I have enjoined in this Senate over the last few years is that it is a debate, rightly said by Senator Kernot, boycotted in this chamber by the three Queensland National Party senators. It is boycotted because they do not wish to declare their position. Elected to a public chamber in public view to hold up public policy, they have absented themselves so that publicly they cannot be pinned on where they stand on this particular issue. Everyone knows the reason for that: there is a massive split in the coalition over what should happen on this subject. This is not surprising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look around Australia we see that in New South Wales Liberal Premier Greiner is embattled. He has been subjected to the first censure motion on a Premier in the New South Wales Parliament since 1939. In Tasmania we see a Liberal Premier battling to recognise unions. He is dealing with a serious industrial relations problem by adopting a policy which has been abandoned by Mr Howard and Dr Hewson. In Western Australia, a by-election in the seat of Ashburton, which the Liberals expected to win, was fought on the Fightback package. They lost and now the Leader of the Liberal Party in Western Australia, Barry MacKinnon, is being undermined within his own Caucus. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper reported on Monday of this week that Labor is in front in the polls in Western Australia. In the Wills by-election in Victoria the Liberal Party vote actually went down in a high unemployment situation because people have rejected the Fightback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the context of that national disarray of the Opposition, along comes the Queensland National Party&mdash;all I can say is that the Opposition must have needed this like a hole in the head&mdash;to put demands upon the Fightback package that Dr Hewson said will not change. He said, `We will not change our Fightback package and I insist on absolute discipline'. But then, lo and behold, the Leader of the National Party in this chamber, Senator Boswell, spoke on ABC radio on the sixteenth of this month. This was an extraordinary thing for the leader of a party in this chamber to say. Senator Boswell has stood up here on his hind legs and, off and on, in and out, up and down, described the virtues of the Fightback package as the greatest ever contained in a public document in Australia. On 16 April he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wasn't aware of what the coalition policy was today on the tariff issue until I read it in the paper and the coalition as far as I know has not taken any position and it will be up to the party room to take that position.</PARA>
<PARA>Wrong, Senator Boswell. The coalition's policy is in the Fightback document. It is for negligible tariffs&mdash;that is to say, to take tariffs down to zero. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us face the fact: the Opposition is a bit cunning on this. It tries to have it every which way it possibly can. It depends on whom one asks. If we ask Dr Hewson, he says, `Negligible tariffs means that it might be zero or it might be plus a bit or it might be minus a bit'. So much for precision from Dr Hewson! If we ask Ian McLachlan, he says, `Well, negligible tariffs means somewhere between nought and 5 per cent'. If we ask Mr Howard, he says something different. At Ingham in Queensland the other day, he said, `Well, oh, negligible tariffs&mdash;that means something like between nought or 5 or 10 per cent'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the coalition comes apart, as the Fightback package is revealed as being as nothing more than a new way of imposing a consumption tax of 15 per cent on Australian people and gypping middle and low income earners out of a fair shake, the stresses on the coalition make Opposition members try to run and scamper away from their undertakings on tariff reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts are clear; they have been frequently cited by the Opposition&mdash;it is a zero tariff regime. It is a zero tariff regime because it is an ideologically driven view about what the economy should look like. Never mind real life&mdash;as long as it comes up in the blue-pink haze of a computer screen, driven by numbers crunched somewhere deep in the bowels of a think-tank, it must be true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say something about our policy on tariff reform.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook), who has just spoken on this motion to retain the sugar tariff at its present level, introduced by the Democrats, has indicated that he must be extremely worried indeed by the strength and success of the Opposition's Fightback package, because he has not addressed himself to the issues that have been raised by Senator Kernot in this debate at all. He has not, incredibly, defended the Government's own sugar tariff policy. He spent all his time trying to throw mud around&mdash;playing politics&mdash;in relation to alleged divisions in the Opposition. Indeed, he has even dragged in some questions of State politics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is rather surprising, in view of Senator Cook's mention of political situations in New South Wales and Tasmania, that he never bothered to mention the difficulties and problems facing Labor governments in Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia and the parlous state of his Party there. However, I did not rise to debate these matters this afternoon with Senator Cook, who has introduced them because of the paucity of the Government's own policies in relation to this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kernot, on behalf of the Democrats, has raised the question of the tariff on sugar as from 1 July this year and the need, as the Democrats say, for it to remain at its present level and not be reduced until a successful conclusion is reached in the GATT Uruguay Round. Unlike the Minister, who did not seem able to put a clear-cut position in relation to the matter, I would like to say at the outset that the Opposition is strongly opposed to the proposal of the Democrats in the urgency motion and we will be voting against it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the irony of the speech that we have just heard from the Minister is the fact that the current tariff level is to be reduced as from 1 July 1992 from $76 to $55 a tonne as a result of legislation introduced by the Government and passed through this Parliament about a year ago. It is a major piece of Government policy following its March economic statement last year. The Senate will remember all the hype there was then about this statement. This is one of the features of it. As I said, it was debated in this Parliament and went through this Parliament about a year ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition supported the tariff reductions in the sugar industry in that legislation and that is going to happen as a result of the legislation passed here. It seems surprising to me that the Democrats, who have been opposed to that and who are still opposed to that, come in here today with an urgency motion saying it is necessary to retain a tariff which, as a result of legislation already passed, will be reduced from 1 July this year. I would have thought that if the Democrats were not really trying to play politics they would have introduced a Bill to try to change the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard all the politics being played by the Minister. Most of his speech was totally irrelevant to this debate. Maybe the Democrats themselves have introduced this motion today because they think there is a little politics for them in the sugar industry in Queensland at the present moment. That seems to be the only possible explanation of why this urgency motion has been brought on today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, the Opposition supports the current regime for a reduction in tariffs in the sugar industry. It is notorious that this subject has been discussed again by the Opposition in the last few days. If the Democrats thought they were going to get any benefit out of the Opposition looking at this matter, I would have thought it would have been perfectly clear that the Opposition's position has been discussed again and this week has been overwhelmingly endorsed through the ordinary processes of the Opposition parties&mdash;that is, by the shadow Ministry on Monday and our Party meeting yesterday. The Opposition parties have overwhelmingly supported the Fightback proposals in relation not only to tariffs generally but also to this specific matter concerning sugar industry tariffs and the whole of the Fightback proposals which I will deal with shortly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us forget about the politics which have motivated the Democrats; that is clearly the only subject that the Minister is interested in. Let us look at the real policy requirements of this nation in relation to tariff policies. The Opposition's tariff policies are crystal clear and have been so for nearly two years. They have been reaffirmed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document and clearly and overwhelmingly reaffirmed by the Opposition at its meetings this week. This is where the Democrats fall down completely: the Government claims it has a tariff reduction policy and, clearly, the Opposition has a tariff reduction policy. The policy cannot then be amended every time one industry or section of the community says they are being harmed by this policy. Of course, the Democrats want to come in and help that person because that is the way they play politics. They are nice to anybody who is making a complaint by saying, `We will fix it up for you'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is simply not the way to govern in this country. In the past that approach has resulted in maintaining these very high levels of protection that have been so harmful to Australia, and to Australian consumers in particular. Tomorrow the Democrats will come in here and have a debate because some consumer group or other has been lobbying them and the Democrats want their support. There can be nothing more damaging to consumers&mdash;the people that the Democrats often want to help&mdash;than the high levels of protection that have applied in this country and which the Opposition is dedicated to removing by the year 2000. Last year in its economic statement the Government also adopted an accelerated policy of tariff reduction and this policy concerning sugar is one of them. I gather that the Government is sticking to its guns on this issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not really being diverted by those comments and I will carry on with my speech in the way that I intended. The Government has also adopted a policy of tariff reduction, although not as satisfactorily or as full as that of the Opposition. In its statement last year the Government moved to accelerate tariff reduction and the sugar industry is an example of that. The Government itself has been wavering in relation to its own policies on tariff reductions. It did so during the Wills by-election and where it really stands now is rendered uncertain. Today Senator Cook in what he had to say did not add any strength to the Government's policy. It is a very good example of how one cannot weaken on tariff issues when there are groups here and there saying, `It is hurting us; you must help us and change it for our benefit'. That is absolutely fatal to the success of a tariff reduction policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst talking about a tariff that concerns the rural industry, I wish to refer to a press release issued by the President of the New South Wales Farmers Association, Mr Peter Taylor, on 23 April. Mr Taylor issued a press release with the heading `Sugar tariffs must continue to go'. This comes from the New South Wales Farmers Association. The farmers of this country know that tariffs cannot be maintained at their current levels because they are most detrimental to rural industries in Australia. Mr Taylor also points out in this statement that if transfers of this kind were made in other rural industries, such as the wool, wheat and cattle industries, at the same level as the sugar industry&mdash;which is what the Democrats want to maintain&mdash;horrific costs and benefits would be transferred to those industries. It points out that there cannot be this picking and choosing between one aspect of industry and another. Mr Taylor goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Highly protected industries in Australia historically have found an excuse for hanging on to their assistance irrespective of prevailing economic circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a classic case of trying to exempt one particular group from an otherwise sound policy. The Opposition does not intend to do that. We will stick to our policies and to our guns. We will not be diverted by the pleadings of one group such as the Democrats are doing here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are enormous burdens on manufacturing industry in Australia as a result of the high cost of sugar as an input to manufacturing. For example, the confectionery, soft drinks, food preserving, canning industries and so on are all pointing out the sorts of costs. There will be over $100m per year in extra cost burdens on those industries. Of course, in addition, there is the cost to the consumer as a result of those costs going through to the CPI. I again point that out to the Democrats and ask them what their answer is to that problem and those people's complaints. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policies of the Opposition do not stop at simple tariff reductions, which seem to be the main focus of Government policy. The great strength of the Fightback policy is that we intend to introduce wide-ranging economic reforms right across the board when we are returned to government which will be of great benefit to all industries in Australia, especially to rural industries and the sugar industry in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On return to government we will bring about reforms which will far outweigh any additional cost that the sugar industry may get as a result of this tariff reduction. Our reforms, which will enable reductions in business taxes of $20 billion a year, will be far more important to the sugar industry but, more importantly, they will be vitally important and valuable to all Australian industries&mdash;not just the rural industries but right across the board to manufacturing, service and all other industries. These reductions will be the sorts of benefits that the Opposition will be introducing, which will be part and parcel of our policy of removing protection by the year 2000. Of course that policy will be of enormous benefit to all Australians and not just to this or that little section of people who happen to go along and complain to the Democrats. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter of urgency proposed by the Australian Democrats seeks to attract the support of the Senate to postpone any further reduction in sugar tariffs until a successful conclusion is reached in the GATT Uruguay Round. The urgency motion is phrased in that particular way because it is fairly obvious that Australia, once again, is continuing the practice of giving away a bargaining chip. The reduction in sugar tariffs had its beginnings historically in 1973 when the then Whitlam Government introduced a 25 per cent cut in tariffs right across the board. It was only after the cut was made that people asked themselves, `Why did we do it?  Why did we cut tariffs?  Why did we create unemployment? What is the strategic objective of this particular strategy, if there is one?'. Once again, we are engaging in a ferocious tariff reduction program and the question must again be asked, `Why are we doing it?'.</PARA></TALK.START>

We must get our industries to become more effective, more efficient, more able to compete on the world markets. Unfortunately, the evidence is otherwise. The evidence is that we are not making our industries more efficient, but rather that we are destroying our industries and replacing Australian products with imports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to an article, published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> newspaper on 21 April 1992, by Tim Colebatch, in which he said:</PARA>

This is one of the fairy tales that we have been fed&mdash;that to gain a quid pro quo with GATT, to be recognised by other trading nations, to become part of the international trading community, we must be good boys and girls; we must reduce our tariffs; we must cut out all other protective measures. The truth is that tariffs are not prohibited under GATT. It is, therefore, not surprising that the United States is using them to protect, for instance, its ball-bearing and computer industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even quotas and import surcharges are justified if the country concerned has balance of payments difficulties. Certainly we can say, and the evidence is there, that Australia has had balance of payments difficulties. The only thing that GATT prohibits is subsidies. Here we come to the nub of the question: what about the United States; what about the European Community? Farmers in those countries are receiving subsidies of up to 44 per cent. No wonder those countries do not want to bring their particular agricultural industries under the GATT regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worthwhile to look at the United States' trade barriers which are currently in force. In 1990 primary producers in the United States were paid subsidies equal to 44 per cent of farm output. In 1988, 94 per cent of Illinois' and 72 per cent of Iowa's net farm income came in the form of government cheques. Since 1985&mdash;and this is probably the worst aspect of current United States policy&mdash;there have been over 110 export enhancement programs offered to 75 countries.

However, the massive increase in the imports of cars, TCF products and the corresponding wave of job losses and factory closures confirms the failure of the Keating-Hewson scorched earth policy. In fact, tariffs and other protective devices are but one of the measures necessary to achieve the twin objectives of high international competitiveness and low unemployment. It is utterly simplistic to make a general judgment that tariffs are good or bad.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the Government is well aware of the great importance of the sugar industry to coastal Queensland and northern New South Wales. The sugar industry employs 6,500 people directly, accounts for tens of thousands of jobs in associated industries and the economic infrastructure of many of those local communities.

Just as it was a Labor government which started the industry, it is only a Labor government which has the vision to carry the industry through to the next century. It is the Labor Government which is offering a safety net; it is the Labor Government which is communicating and consulting with the industry.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was in Mackay only last week and am well aware of the extreme concerns of the industry there. As a matter of fact, I have arranged a deputation of growers from the Mackay region to meet with the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Crean, tomorrow afternoon to spell out the extent of their concern in relation to the timing mentioned by Senator Kernot.

<PARA>Reduction in tariff levels must be at a pace which the industry can sustain. Let me restate the Government's position on tariffs for the sugar industry. I think it is important that honourable senators understand how different the Government's position is from that of the coalition. When Senator Kernot's motion comes to the vote, those in the gallery and the media will report the Government and the Opposition sitting on the same side of the chamber. Only if one is prepared to contrast the quite different positions of the Government and the coalition will one understand that there is a major difference between the two. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to spell out those differences. The Government's general position is spelt out in the March 1991 economic statement. It is to phase down tariffs on general agricultural products to 5 per cent by 1 July 1996 in line with the reductions in protection for the general manufacturing sector. However&mdash;`however' is of most importance&mdash;in the specific instances of the dairy, sugar and tobacco industries, the Government stated that it was disposed to reduce assistance over the longer term to the 5 per cent level but that full consideration of assistance to these industries would follow the Industry Commission inquiries into those industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, it was announced that tariffs on sugar of $76 per tonne from 1 July 1991 and $55 per tonne from 1 July 1992 would apply and that the $55 per tonne rate would stand. Further, the Minister has announced that the $55 per tonne tariff will remain unchanged until 1 July 1993, with future tariff levels to be determined only after full consultation with the industry and State governments. To provide for this consultation, the Government has decided to establish a task force, headed by the honourable member for Hinkler, Mr Brian Courtice. The task force is to report back to Minister Crean by the end of the year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is that commitment to consultation and the safety net that contrasts the Government's policy with that of the coalition. Let me just comment on the coalition. Unlike the coalition&mdash;or should I say the Liberal Party and some of the National Party; because there is such division it is hard to know who is thinking what&mdash;the Government does not regard the Industry Commission's report as a blueprint for industry reform. These reports should be seen as an analytical tool for developing, in consultation with industry, policies for the development of specific industries within the framework of our general policy on tariffs. The Opposition has two approaches to tariffs. First, it has a policy of negligible tariff protection for all industries by the year 2000, but its definition of `negligible' varies. `Negligible' used to mean close to zero, but now it seems to be close to 5 per cent. What does `negligible' mean? Does it mean zero or does it mean 5 per cent?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the Opposition commits itself to the adoption of Industry Commission recommendations. What Fightback promises on tariffs is a reform in the area of rural and manufacturing assistance which will entail elimination of quota, tariff and bounty assistance.

Senator Cook said that the Government is monitoring the situation of the sugar growers.

To this Government it appears that an efficient industry with this contribution to crop exports which generates thousands of jobs, which generates disposable income for people to spend on local products, which then creates further full time jobs&mdash;30 for every $1m spent on locally made goods&mdash;is not good enough justification and that, somehow, conditions pertaining to the car industry are more important, are more special.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last evening, when we were discussing the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill, I began my speech by referring to those weighty but uncontentious matters&mdash;matters that have the support, I believe, of all senators in the chamber&mdash;which are the substantial matters in this legislation. They are the repealing of the National Service Act and its subsequent legislation, and the amendment to the Defence Act itself as it relates to the persons liable to conscription, and the deletion of inappropriate&mdash;I think I used the word `Aristotelian'&mdash;categories. They might have been appropriate in 1904 but they now ought to be more flexible and related to the particular emergency of the defence of Australia, which would prompt any action under this Act. Those categories will now be determined by regulation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These matters, together with the references in this legislation to the Defence personnel Acts&mdash;those amendments that relate to the Defence Forces Retirement and Death Benefits Act, the Defence Housing Authority Act and the Military Superannuation and Benefits Act&mdash;are all supported by the Opposition and, as I have said, are uncontentious. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, one of the things I said in my introduction last night was that this is the first time in at least a decade that the Parliament is considering a philosophical matter&mdash;a very considerable matter of policy in the area of defence&mdash;and that is the particular provisions in our law for conscription for the defence of Australia and for conscientious objection to that conscription. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is now understood that, as a result of the amendments contained in this legislation, if ever conscription is required&mdash;and I, for one, hope that it never will be&mdash;it will be a requirement falling upon men and women alike. That is, all citizens of Australia aged 18 to 60&mdash;not only citizens but also permanent residents with at least six months residency in Australia&mdash;male and female, will be contributing through conscription to the immediate defence of Australia, according to the particular strengths and abilities of the individual. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to three matters about which there are various views in this chamber. The first is one which I think will gain the full approval of senators, and that is that before any conscription proclamation is made, the government of the day will need to gain parliamentary approval for it. I believe that that will gain the support of all senators in this chamber. I note that this is a new element to conscription. It is a new element in terms of it being a restriction upon the full powers of the elected government of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In matters of defence, one of the first responsibilities of the elected government is to ensure the security of the people of Australia and the defence of Australia. I must say that I have reservations about this new provision requiring parliamentary approval. I support the legislation as it stands, and I conscientiously support parliamentary approval being required if ever there is to be a conscription proposal brought by the government of the day. My reservation is that I do not want this to be seen as the thin edge of the wedge and that the government of the day will require parliament's approval in matters of defence before it can act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I am generally seeing the strengths of referenda in this country. Certainly, in any democracy, I see the importance of fairly conducted elections. But I do not believe that executive government is best conducted through referenda or through multiple elections. After an election has been held in this country, the elected government has a mandate and a responsibility to go about its task of governing. One of the few instances where there is a requirement for executive action to gain the approval of the Parliament is when the Government believes that conscription is necessary for the immediate defence of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons for this is the whole century of debate in this country about conscription. There was enormous contention in this country about conscription at the time of the Vietnam war and, under the National Service Act, the conscription of young men to fight overseas in Indo-China. I acknowledge the other times in our history in which there has been contention about the government of the day deciding upon conscription. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A precedent was established during the Gulf war debate in January last year with the&mdash;not near unanimity&mdash;overwhelming majority of Government and Opposition members supporting the Government's decisions on Australia's role in the Gulf war. I believe that it was a great asset to our deployed troops, our contingent that was part of the allied effort in the Gulf, for this Parliament to have had that debate and for the overwhelming majority of members of parliament to have shown their support for what was then to be Australia's involvement in the Gulf. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a similar way, were there ever to be any pending invasion of Australia or any direct and immediate threat to the invasion of Australia, it would be appropriate for the government of the day to formulate a series of defence decisions, including conscription, and to bring them in an opportune way to this Parliament, and to gain a similar endorsement of the actions proposed under the Defence Act&mdash;as so amended by the legislation in front of us&mdash;that would show that the government and opposition of the day were at least conscientiously able to put their views. If there were ever such a threat to the invasion of Australia, I believe there would be an agreement on the necessity of conscription. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that debate the Parliament would be able to make its own representations; it would be able to reflect the views of the people of Australia in any modification, extension, variation or safeguards that would be involved in the parliamentary approvals that were given. My major reservation is this: I do not wish to see this Parliament regard this situation as the thin edge of the wedge so that the government of the day would be required to gain parliamentary approval in defence matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the question of the 90-day limit. The Opposition does not agree with the words in this legislation that require parliamentary approval for conscription to be given within 90 days. I do not believe that we lose anything by removing entirely that reference to 90 days, because it would still be within the power of the Government to gain that approval at any point after the matter was proposed. If Australia were about to be invaded or if it were threatened with direct invasion, it would be most surprising if the Government did not act immediately by bringing before Parliament the proposal for the defence of Australia that it had formulated. This reference to 90 days then becomes unnecessary and redundant. It is with that in mind and with the expectation that parliamentary approval would flow within a much lesser period than 90 days that I join with my Opposition colleagues in opposing that reference in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come now to the definition of conscription that is set out in the legislation. As I said last night, this flows from the inquiry of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs into conscientious objection to conscripted military service and the report that that Senate Committee brought down in 1985. The former ground on which conscientious objection to service in a war was given was rather narrowly confined to religious grounds&mdash;to the ground that someone was a lifelong pacifist on religious grounds. We had many instances of conscientious objection in the First World War, the Second World War, in the Vietnam war and in every case where the Australian public had been called upon to serve in a war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have recognised as one of the values in Australia that, on religious grounds, a person could argue, `I am a pacifist. It is against my conscience to take up arms and, although I am required by law to meet the call-up or the conscription as a loyal Australian, I am a pacifist and will not be able conscientiously to do so'. There has been historic provision to allow that as an excuse for not serving in a war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The definition of conscientious objection that is now before us is much wider than that. But whilst it is wider than the profession of pacifism and it is wider than religious grounds, it is nevertheless very constrained and appropriately limited. The definition states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a person is taken to have a conscientious belief in relation to a matter if the person's belief in respect of that matter:</PARA>

<PARA>It is not sufficient that it be the view of a particular minority political party&mdash;a political view or a temporary view. It must be a longstanding view based upon a conviction about what is morally right and wrong. It must be compelling. So when a person makes an appeal to the tribunal provided for in this legislation for conscientious objection, the tribunal tests his application according to that definition. I support the definition and I believe it is supported by every honourable senator in this chamber and, as I say, it flows from the Senate report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where there is contention, I refer to an additional ground for conscientious belief that is set out on the next page of the legislation which would allow persons to have conscientious objection to a particular war or a particular conflict. This involves a claim that they are conscientious objectors, not in general to all wars or not for all of their life, but that with regard to a particular war they have conscientious views, based on what is morally right and wrong, which they must espouse and which are longstanding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a question of logic for me. It seems to me almost impossible to conceive why any Australian or Australian resident would wish to take the particular ground of conscientious objection when all that is at stake is the immediate defence of Australia from invasion. I acknowledge this ground of conscientious objection in the situation of Vietnam&mdash;not under the Defence Act but under the National Service Act involving an overseas expeditionary force. I refer to a force sent conscientiously by the Government of Australia to join allies indirectly for the defence of Australia. In the case of, say, Vietnam historically, I would have agreed with a set of words such as we see in clause 9(d)(i) of this Bill. That provision refers to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">persons whose conscientious beliefs do not allow them to participate in a particular war or particular warlike operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that should be stressed is that this package of legislation that is now before us repeals the National Service Act. It is no longer possible to have conscription for service in Vietnam. Conscription is confined to the immediate defence of Australia. In that respect I join with my Opposition colleagues in opposing the words of the clause that I read out that would allow conscientious objection to a particular war. I believe that it would lead mostly, if not entirely, to administrative difficulty and to a range of applications that would largely be difficult to uphold. It would delay the whole procedure with regard to any administrative conscription provision that the Australian Government and the Parliament had approved and put in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator MacGibbon referred to one possible case where persons of the Islam faith, if there were an invasion by persons who were also of the Islam faith, might wish to object to that particular conflict because they would be fighting against persons of their own faith. I do not believe that Australians can place that kind of allegiance ahead of the immediate defence of Australia from invasion. This is not to send an expeditionary force; it is to immediately defend Australia. If we were to allow such an example as I have referred to, it might be possible to contemplate almost any argument of conscientious objection to a particular war. I do not allow for that. I have said very clearly that my support for conscientious objection in a particular war would be confined to a situation such as Vietnam, which situation is no longer possible under the Defence Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With those remarks, I commend the great majority of the very welcome provisions that are now before the Senate in this defence legislation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Defence Legislation Amendment Bill contains a number of measures concerning conscription, conscientious objection to military service, and housing and retirement provisions for Defence Force personnel. Several of these provisions are uncontroversial, but the conscription and conscientious objection amendments are more substantial and I will address them in more detail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, the Democrats support this Bill as a small, mostly symbolic step in the right direction towards a more sensible and democratic defence system for Australia. However, it totally and deliberately fails to address the reality of Australia's security environment, which dictates that our defence forces are far more likely to be deployed in overseas conflicts than in defence of the nation. My colleague Senator Spindler is finalising several amendments to address this concern and will circulate them shortly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the two major provisions in this Bill is that women and Aboriginal people will be potentially eligible for conscription, although the actual classes of conscripts will no longer be defined in the Defence Act. Instead, they will be specified by regulation. It is important to note that the Defence Act, as it now stands, only permits conscription in time of war, which is defined in that Act as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . any invasion or apprehended invasion of, or attack or apprehended attack on, Australia by an enemy or armed force.</PARA>
<PARA>Given that our policy envisages that conscription could be warranted in the event that Australia's survival as a nation state is at risk, we have no difficulty with that aspect of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The potential eligibility of women for conscription is in one sense a landmark change. However, the important word here is `potential'. Given that women are currently excluded from combat roles in the Defence Force, the Democrats do not anticipate that regulations to introduce conscription would change this situation, although we would ask the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) to respond to this point. Subject to this qualification, and given the Bill's welcome provision that conscription is subject to parliamentary approval, the Democrats agree that women cannot reasonably be exempted from playing a role in the defence of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the Democrats' viewpoint, the most significant provision of this Bill is to enshrine in the Defence Act the right of potential conscripts to conscientious objection to military service. Exemption may be claimed for all wars or for a particular war and from combatant duties only or from all military service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In general, the Democrats support the right of conscientious objection as a fundamental civil liberty as well as being in the best interests of Australia's defence. For some people the taking of another life, which in normal times is seen as the most repugnant of crimes, is an intolerable affront to their conscience and their morality, no matter what the circumstances. To force these people into military service is not only unjust but it must also weaken the Defence Force by the inclusion of people whose capacity to perform their duties is highly questionable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats support the establishment of conscientious objection tribunals to determine the claims of conscripts. Thorough examination of claims is essential to ensure that conscientious objection is not opportunistically employed as a means of avoiding military service for other reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have listened to the views of the Opposition, which appears to be concerned that conscientious objection by conscripts to service in the event of an attack on Australia&mdash;which is what this Bill provides for&mdash;should not be allowed on the ground that such service is paramount national duty. The Opposition appears to be particularly concerned by the proposal to allow exemption from a particular war, as Senator Teague has just said, which could presumably be sought on the ground of national descent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats do not believe that our reasons for supporting conscientious objection are negated in the event of a direct threat to our national security. I have listened to what Senator Teague has been saying; he is very sensible on the matter. We have no doubt that the vast majority of Australians would be sufficiently motivated by self-interest and a sense of national duty to play their role in countering that threat. But we also regard as an inevitable consequence of our high immigration rates and our diverse sources of immigrants that, for some people, military service against a country with which they have had recent historical ties would provoke a crisis of conscience. Nothing would be gained by compelling such people to serve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we believe that the conscientious objection provisions of this Bill look like an unjustifiably soft option in that an objector would be free to continue civilian life without interruption, while conscripts would be required to make huge sacrifices. It is our understanding that in some European countries conscientious objectors must perform community service in lieu of military service. We will be moving amendments to require conscientious objection tribunals to prescribe community service for Australian objectors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Democrats welcome the improvements in the conscription and conscientious objection provisions of the Defence Act contained in this Bill, the fact remains that there is little prospect that they will be used for at least the next decade. It is generally accepted that we face no substantial military threats over at least that period. It is far more likely that any future combat operations will be conducted overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the controversial nature of such deployments, a legacy of our historical tendency to follow great and powerful friends into foreign wars, the Democrats are particularly concerned that this Bill does not give volunteer service personnel the right of conscientious objection to service in overseas conflicts. Many Australians, including some in the Defence Force, have strong moral objections to such service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While Defence Force volunteers should not be able to seek exemption from their fundamental duty to defend Australia, we believe that they should be able to claim exemption from overseas combat operations. As with conscripts, their claims should be heard by conscientious objection tribunals. We will be moving amendments to achieve this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats are somewhat disappointed that this Bill demonstrates that the Government has not learned one of the major lessons of its Gulf war deployment. The controversy which was provoked by the unilateral commitment of Australian naval personnel and warships to combat operations in the Persian Gulf, which resulted in a hastily arranged parliamentary sitting some days later, was a salutary demonstration of the community's expectation that parliamentary approval should have been sort. Yet there is nothing in this Bill which enshrines such an obligation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Parliament will be given the right to disallow conscription in the dire circumstances of a direct threat to Australia, yet we will have no control over a government which again decides to risk Australian lives in an unnecessary war aimed only at keeping oil prices as low as possible. We will therefore be moving amendments to make the deployment of Australian forces to overseas conflicts subject to parliamentary approval. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From a technical point of view, this Bill is a step forward. But in its relevance to the real world in which the Australian Defence Force operates, it represents very little change. It improves the regulatory framework governing uncontroversial deployments which are likely to occur, while leaving Cabinet free to deploy military forces to conflicts which have no relevance to our national security and are far more likely to divide the Australian community. While we support the Bill, we urge the Government and the Opposition to give serious consideration to our amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 1992. I will keep my comments very brief. However, I wish to refer to certain aspects of the legislation. Of course, the Liberal and National parties do not object to the part of this legislation which clarifies the circumstances that would justify the imposition of conscription. The Bill removes reference to the fact that conscription applies to males between 18 and 60 years of age who are British subjects.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year the Australian Democrats mounted a quite childish and disgraceful scare campaign to the effect that conscription would be applied to the Gulf war. This has shown the need for this Parliament to consider carefully under what circumstances conscription should be justified. Senator Bourne, who has just fled the chamber like a gazelle, really does not seem to realise the significance of much of what the Democrats have stood for in the past and what they are obviously standing for in the future. I will come back to some of that in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The community at large is frequently told that short term national service would be of benefit to young Australians. I respect the concern that many people have that the concept of national service is a good one, especially when we look at the number of young Australians who lack employment and direction. However, I would have to say that that attitude does concern me in another respect. People who are suggesting this course of action and who do not wish any harm to the services probably have not considered the effect that this would have on the services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People who wish to gain entry to the services are required to have very high qualifications. They have to be of a satisfactory standard. I do not think the services should in any way be a dumping ground for the criminals of Australia. I therefore always urge caution when people talk about reforming certain individuals by making them subject to national service. I think this would be undesirable not only for the services but also for the defence of our country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no longer appropriate that compulsory conscription should be pursued in a military context. We have moved a long way from the arrangement that was put in place early this century when this Parliament gave bipartisan support for the military training of schoolboys. That, too, is a very sad reflection on the changes that have taken place. I think the training of schoolboy cadets was a very substantial part of the education system. Young boys were given an excellent grounding for future life. At that time Australia was defended by putting every man into uniform and giving him a rifle. In the 1960s blanket conscription of this type to ensure our security no longer made any military sense, let alone being relevant in other areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a fact that the Australian electorate did endorse conscription by ballot that existed between 1964 and 1972. However, it is no longer acceptable that compulsory overseas military service should apply only to a selection of young Australian men. Over the last two decades there has been a trend among Western democracies to abandon military conscription. This is based on the fact that defence needs are best met by small professional forces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the Australian people will accept the need for compulsory military service when our nation is under direct threat. It is therefore proper that Parliament should give specific endorsement to conscription. There needs to be the explicit backing of the Australian people, just as our contribution to the Gulf war was vindicated by Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have little doubt that in a scenario of direct military threat to Australia, such as we faced in 1942, the support of Parliament through the two major parties would be forthcoming. I would never go so far as to suggest that the Australian Democrats or the independent Greens, the peacemakers&mdash;call them what you like&mdash;would be supportive of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The performance that we saw last year from the Democrats and then Independent Senator Vallentine during the debate on the Gulf war was nothing short of appalling. The then Senator Vallentine sought to disrupt the Parliament, both in this chamber and in the House of Representatives. Her actions brought the whole of the Parliament into disrepute. I certainly hope that her successor does not carry on like a trained seal and act in the same way as she did on that occasion and, I might add, on many others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is appropriate that the Parliament should be able to exercise a veto in respect of actions of the Executive. A little while ago Senator Bourne said that people who come from certain countries should be exempt from conscription if they do not want to fight in a conflict in the country which they left. I find that absolutely and utterly staggering, coming from the Australian Democrats, who are great advocates of multiculturalism in other areas. Presumably, people who take out Australian citizenship or residency should be committed first to Australia and not the country from which they came. This is particularly the case if such people have taken out Australian citizenship. I would hope that the Australian Democrats would place more importance on Australian citizenship than that which Senator Bourne described today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the Labor Government has failed to be consistent in making a political concession to minorities against the national interest in terms of new division 2 of part IV of the Defence Act, which deals with the termination of conscientious objection to military service. The right of a person not to bear arms should always be respected, although in time of peril&mdash;I stress in time of peril&mdash;the Australian nation has the right to demand of all its citizens that they assist the defence effort in some form. That is where, once again, I come into conflict with what the Australian Democrats have been saying that it should be easy to get out of it and use some other form of excuse. Indeed, when such a small proportion of a modern defence force is actually using weapons, there is massive scope for those with a conscientious objection to taking life to perform alternative roles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a sense, this Labor Government is fighting Vietnam all over again by introducing the avenue of conscientious objection to a particular war. There can indeed be proper debate as to whether Australians should have the right to object to participation to a particular overseas conflict. What we are talking about, however, in the context of this legislation, is a hypothetical war that threatens Australia with invasion or surrender, not a conflict pursued against aggression far from our shores. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is only reasonable to suggest that no Australian has the right to decide that they will opt out of a particular war when our survival is at stake. I think that is particularly pertinent. Once again, instead of the Democrats calling on us to be reasonable, I think it is about time the Democrats looked at the reality of the situation of war, what the likelihood of a threat to Australia is and what we should do as a consequence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are not circumstances where individuals can make political decisions not to participate&mdash;when the fight is for survival. It would have been rather quaint 50 years ago to have allowed Australians to opt out of the war effort on the grounds that they thought it acceptable to be overrun by the Japanese. I just think that, in getting some reality into this, we need to look back in history and learn from it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot extend the grounds of conscientious objection so widely as to allow in effect disloyalty to Australia. It may be suggested that this unnecessary extra condition of opposition to a particular war has been introduced in order to conciliate ethnic minorities who protested at our participation in the Gulf war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to the point: are Australians Australians or are they Australians only when it suits them? I would hope that Australians are Australians through and through from beginning to end and all points in between. If that is so and we are to conciliate ethnic minorities, we are insulting those we should assume to be good Australians who would surely defend this country under direct threat, no matter where it came from. I think that is the point that we need to be focusing on today. Are we going to defend this country from all risk at whatever time?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a Liberal, I am opposed to war but cannot deny the fact that war is sometimes inevitable to oppose greater evil and injustice. The Senate, I think, should reflect on the words of a former Governor-General of Australia, Sir William Slim, who nearly 50 years ago stood in resistance to Japanese military fascism at the head of a truly multicultural army of European and Indian soldiers. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If ever an army fought in a just cause, we did. We coveted no man's country; we wished to impose no form of government on any nation. We fought for the clean, the decent, the free things of life, for the right to live our lives in our own way, as others could live theirs, to worship God in what faith we chose, to be free in body and mind and for our children to be free. We fought only because the powers of evil had attacked these things.</PARA>
<PARA>I think those words are as true today as they were at that time. This is the kind of attitude that would animate any defence of Australia against external threat. We are a democracy that respects basic human rights and we must protect that. For that reason, there can be no selective loyalty when our whole society is in danger. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would disturb me greatly if I believed that Australians were becoming selectively loyal. I do not believe that is so. I think Australians are loyal people and we should not be making it easy for others who may have various other motives to opt out at the sign of conflict. Liberal democracies are by their very nature worth fighting for. There can and should be respected conscientious objection to war, but not assent to a selective loyalty in time of direct threat to their independence and survival as free societies. For this reason, the Bill should be amended to remove this excessive and inappropriate circumstance of conscientious objection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Conscription has moved from being an accepted form of defence to a last resort. We know that it is a last resort. People accept that it is a last resort. We should all hope that the circumstances in which this legislation would operate remain very much hypothetical. It should, however, reflect the patriotic necessity for the defence of Australia and without concessions that imply that commitment to our country for some would be an optional extra. I do not believe commitment to this country should ever be an optional extra, particularly in a time of war. </PARA>

Senator Knowles referred to former Senator Vallentine. I was an admirer of former Senator Vallentine not so much for the causes she adopted but for the way she went about adopting them. She was often alone in supporting a cause. Something I always think is attractive and something to be admired in people is the fact that they can stand alone and nevertheless press on in support of the things they believe in. Former Senator Vallentine certainly adopted causes and objectives which did not meet majority support at all.

That provision arose from an excellent report from the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Conscientious Objection to Conscripted Military Service</EMPHASIS> which was produced in 1985.

It was not qualified in the way that Senator Teague is suggesting, certainly on my reading of the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Teague has asked where that came from. It was perhaps best expressed by a witness who came before the Committee, Professor Peter Singer, who is Professor of Philosophy at the Monash University. These passages are quoted in the report and these quotes found favour with the Committee. The passages state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my view the only possible definition of a conscientious belief is a belief based on a seriously held moral conviction. That is, of course, very broad and it is perhaps best understood if we see what it leaves out. What it leaves out most clearly are beliefs based on selfish desires of one sort or another, personal interest, belief based on emotions like fear or ambition perhaps. It also leaves out beliefs which are whimsical or based on impulse.</PARA>
<PARA>What is being made clear there is that the conscientious belief must be just that&mdash;a deeply held conviction from the heart and soul that informs the person who holds it with the greatest of conviction that he should not serve in a particular war. Professor Singer went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that someone who opposed a particular war because they took the view that it could only add to suffering and the death of innocent civilians, without holding any religious basis for it, would be holding a conscientious objection to that particular war. A different war which it might be possible to fight by attacking only military targets they might not object to. So I would say that if we are to take seriously the notion of protecting conscience and giving way to people's conscientious beliefs then we must extend conscientious objection to those who hold a sincere moral conviction against taking part in a particular war. If we do not do that we are simply making an arbitrary distinction between two forms of conscientious belief which are equally conscientious.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say that, in fact, a person who has a conscientious objection to a specific war may&mdash;if you can talk in these terms&mdash;have more merit in his or her position, because that would have come from thinking out the issues involved, whereas a blanket objection is something that a person can hold without really analysing a particular situation. Many of the speeches made today have referred to specific situations and I think that is largely right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I want to make is that the provisions in the Bill that there ought be room for a person to make objection to a specific war on the grounds of conscientious objection, comes not from any multiculturalism or from any desire by anybody to cater for a particular group, but from the conviction that a person's conscience should not be violated, no matter what.

With the growth of technology in war and the sophistication with which war is conducted, there is no reason&mdash;if conscription is to be introduced during a crisis&mdash;why women, who are now as capable as men of running war machines, should not also be required to serve their country. I imagine that, were that tragic situation ever to arise, women would serve equally as well as men. </PARA>

But it is to be remembered that, at the time this country was faced with its greatest threat from outside, the Party which led it through that crisis&mdash;of course with the cooperation of others&mdash;was the Party to which I belong, the ALP, and the great figure heading that Party at that time was John Curtin. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a very daunting task to actually stand in the footsteps of Senator Vallentine and address a topic such as this. I believe it is very important to have a voice in relation to the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 1992. I will be moving two amendments to this Bill when it comes to the committee stage. I wish to discuss the philosophical positions under the two principles which pertain to those amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first amendment I will be moving seeks to delete all reference to conscription in the Defence Act 1903. I will move this amendment because I believe there is no longer a place for conscription in the Australian defence forces, nor is there a place for conscripted military personnel anywhere in our world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This option has not so far entered the debate. While it may not receive support, I would certainly plead that it receive urgent and considerate attention. Even though this voice might be a lone one, it may well be prophetic or a cutting edge that calls us to reconsider dramatically the direction that our security and defence thinking has taken over the last few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nothing has brought home more powerfully the belief that there is no longer any place for conscripted military personnel than the Vietnam war and, more recently, the Gulf war. In both cases the side which was unable to win had enormous numbers of conscripted personnel. Indeed, before the start of the Gulf war much was made of the fact that Saddam Hussein's biggest problem was that he would have to all but hold guns at the head of his draftees in order to stop them from deserting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Vietnam war, the American Army was all but torn apart, both at home and in Vietnam, by the enormous popular revolt and resistance against the draft. I do not think that even the most committed supporter of the American war effort in Vietnam would argue that there were not enormous problems with the fighting will of the many thousands of draftees. Even in the Gulf war, it was evident that the large numbers of reservists called into active duty by the US were not as well equipped in training or motivation to fulfil their duties; and that commanders had to take into account the composition of their forces when planning their strategies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have to address the changing nature of war. An even more important lesson from the Gulf war should convince us that conscription is no longer necessary, let alone desirable. The Gulf war was not fought on the ground by large numbers of troops or naval personnel or by huge waves of air force planes in the air. The war was fought by relatively small groups of highly specialised, high technology weapons systems, operated by people who would best be described as technicians, not soldiers, sailors or pilots. If there are wars yet to come, they will be fought more and more that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the nature of warfare changing so rapidly and with it becoming increasingly equipment oriented, there will be no place for conscripts in future wars. No defence force will be able to build its strategic planning on the basis that large numbers of untrained personnel will become part of the forces, when war has already begin, to be trained in the use of highly specialised equipment and be ready for active duty in the sort of timeframes in which war is already being fought now, much less in years to come, should it be necessary. The position I wish to present for consideration is that all reference to conscription be deleted from the Act and the amendment that I will move at the committee stage will allow that option to be chosen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter I wish to address relates to the conscientious objection amendment. I heartily support its inclusion as being a very enlightened, progressive step. However, I think that to make it available only to those who are conscripted and to be in a place where we are forcing defence forces to ignore their consciences is very questionable. The Government has proposed in this legislation new provisions for people to assert their conscientious objection to particular wars if they are being conscripted. I believe it is only logical that we extend these provisions to serving members of the armed forces. I believe that this is all the more important in light of the manner in which the Australian defence forces are promoting careers as a means of enticing young people to sign up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More and more of the advertising of the defence forces is based on the idea that the Army, Royal Australian Navy or Royal Australian Air Force offers a glamorous career and an alternative to university which actually provides an income, accommodation and other opportunities while people are studying. I wonder if any honourable senator has ever seen a recruiting advertisement which actually says, `We will train you to be able to kill, and perhaps during your term with us you will actually get the chance, and you will not be able to exercise your conscience'. I believe that the permissibility of conscientious objection that has been raised in this amendment is very commendable but needs to be extended equally to those within our defence forces for all the excellent reasons that have been raised in the debate so far. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the world as it is, not as it was, people have vastly different views of their government's foreign goals and styles of working. We cannot assume that a uniformity of opinion exists in the armed forces and we need to take this move towards selective conscientious objection even to assist those very armed forces when the possibility of war arises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A few people have suggested as a way forward that such a move of selective conscientious objection being available to the defence forces as well as to conscripts would be unworkable. How could the armed forces ever plan anything if the possibility existed that some personnel would claim to hold a conscientious objection to a particular war? I believe that this has been overstated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Conscientious objection is not an easy road to take, least of all when a country is actually at war. The process of facing the court and bringing forward a case which is convincing is not easy. The social pressures which are brought to bear on someone who chooses such a path are enormous, as anyone who has had contact with a war resister would know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The time has long gone when the call to arms in Australia resulted in thousands queuing up to enrol in the armed forces. Likewise, fortunately, those who object to war on conscientious grounds are no longer vilified by all and sundry or presented with white feathers. Nevertheless, it is an extremely difficult road to travel. Furthermore, the numbers of conscientious objectors at any time&mdash;if history is some sort of guide&mdash;would be small. Indeed, if the numbers were high, it may well be an indication of a wrongful decision by government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be instructive to consider the legislation presently before the US Congress. That legislation seeks to make similar provision for selective conscientious objection by members of the defence forces. Amongst other things, that legislation provides that those who claim conscientious objection to a war which is declared while they are on overseas duty will be sent back to the USA for their case to be heard. Likewise, those who are in the USA and in the armed forces when war is declared will have their case heard before there is any possibility of their being sent overseas. The provisions extend to members of the armed forces reserves, who were so much a part of the Gulf war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Gulf war demonstrated to me and many others that the possibility of a war being prosecuted on `just war' lines is very remote. This is largely a result of the ever increasing technology of weapons systems. It is now virtually impossible to satisfy that `just war' requirement that excessive force should not be used. The Gulf war demonstrated very clearly that the very nature of the weapons systems now being used can only result in excessive use of force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In such a situation, it is more than possible that members of the defence forces will find themselves deeply disturbed by precisely such a war&mdash;one in which civilian casualties will inevitably be unacceptably high, and the devastation wreaked on the country under attack will be far in excess of the needs of the case. In some situations, people within the armed forces would be in a better position to follow their consciences in the light of the information they have in front of their eyes. The alternative to this amendment is that the armed forces will potentially face a situation of a revolt far greater than that carried out by one seaman during the Gulf war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need a new perspective. The emphasis of this Bill and the amendments&mdash;which I have already said I partially agree with&mdash;is not significant enough to change the perspective of the Bill. It is the wrong way around. The Cold War mentality is still being preserved. Now is the chance to re-examine what we mean by national security, and develop non-military forms of conflict resolution, rather than legislate for conscription and invasion scenarios. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In essence, we need to be putting money into training our diplomats in negotiation and language skills, rather than putting money aside for the ADF. As was pointed out in the ABC radio series on the new world order earlier this year, every dollar channelled from the Department of Defence to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is worth five times as much to the latter Department. What we spend on foreign language and negotiating skills for our diplomats does not even amount to the training of one FA18 pilot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Talk of conscription and invasion ignores the fact that the whole nature of war has changed. A survey conducted in 1988 gave some idea of the scope of the current situation in the world. It reported that of a total of 111 states engaged in armed conflict, 63 of these conflicts were internal and a further 36 were categorised specifically as `wars of state formation' in which the conflict centred on issues concerning autonomy or secession, many of which involved ethnically related issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the publication of that report, the escalation of internal conflict in the former USSR, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Asia and the Pacific projects an image of a world characterised increasingly by ethnically driven political fragmentation. Certainly it is true of this part of the world if we consider the situation in Bougainville, West Papua, East Timor, the South Moluccas, the Philippines, Cambodia, Burma, Sri Lanka<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>, Kashmir and the Punjab. So why are we talking about military training and allowing the old warriors to harp on about the future of military training and the virtues of fighting old battles all over again?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we have to ask what we are teaching our children by continuing this line of thinking about defence and security. As the American anti-militarist Eugene Debs observed in 1916:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would no more teach children military training than teach them arson, robbery or assassination.</PARA>
<PARA>Neither the State nor any other institution has the right to conscript young men and women for war. That, fundamentally, is why I oppose the amendment and support the deletion of conscription. Conscription is the mark of the slave. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For too long we have accepted that almost 10 per cent of our Budget should go on military spending, without even discussing the whole rationale for the military in today's world. It is perfectly true that we live in an unstable region, but virtually all of these conflicts are intrastate rather than interstate and certainly none pose a threat to Australia. Many old wars have been fought to a standstill and, at that point, we call in the United Nations to keep the peace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge that we put the emphasis on war prevention, rather than clearing up the mess. For that, we need to develop skills other than training young men and women in the art of killing which, in the end, is what military training is all about. There is an enormous amount of hypocrisy and cant spoken about national defence. Frequently, politicians condemn groups or individuals who advocate the use of violence to achieve their ends, either at home or overseas. The dawn service on Anzac day dwells on the New Testament message of love and forgiving our enemies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another aspect of depriving people within the armed forces who are prepared to defend Australia is not allowing them the position where they can have conscientious objection to a particular war. We need to ask: what is the assumption underlying our refusal for that? If we cannot guarantee the positive motivation of all people in our defence force, we are the losers. We cannot deny them the fundamental civil liberty of applying their conscience to the position they are in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the concept of defending Australia.

To enable the Budget figures to be `juggled', in creative accounting terms, to achieve those cuts, it took an extra $30m from the bank in that election year. Previously, the Government had taken some 65 per cent of the bank profits&mdash;that is outrageous&mdash;which in 1988-89 would have amounted to $58m.

There was a $2m transfer deal within the financial institutions of the Government to ensure that the interest rate movement on home loans did not occur during that State election campaign. </PARA>

That energy would have created jobs and a future for South Australia, not the debilitating debt which we now have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The period since the 1989 election whilst I have been in the Senate has seen not only Labor's duplicity exposed before the royal commission, but also a great deal of time and opportunity lost for the State. I have watched that with a great deal of frustration. However, during my time here I have gained a much greater appreciation of what South Australia must do to retain influence nationally. I am referring to such issues as the absolute necessity for transparency in government reporting and accounting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In South Australia we have had the accounting standards and reporting mechanisms changed from year to year, because if you change them year to year it is very difficult to track what is happening with the accounting. It is well understood now why that has been the case. While the move is towards a far greater conformity and transparency in the presentation of government finances, the present South Australian Government has been strongly resisting&mdash;and this is recorded&mdash;such a move. In fact, South Australia has been described as the most negative of the States towards this development. Is it any wonder why? It certainly will not be so under any future Liberal government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also need to set about reforming Federal-State financial relations, and reforming government at the State level to ensure that the States maintain a relevant and real role in our federal system. Reducing our State debt is an absolute priority. In South Australia, in particular, we need to reform government trading enterprises to bring economic benefit, financial contribution and vitality to the State, setting in place a formalised financial monitoring system. Then the track record and performance of a government trading enterprise in South Australia could be measured against one in Victoria, one in New South Wales and one in Queensland. There would be a benchmark upon which we could judge these government trading enterprises, if it is inappropriate to privatise them&mdash;but I will not go back to 1985 and the need for privatisation and what the difference might have been had those policies been in place now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My time in the Senate has also clearly shown me the present South Australian Government's abdication of its economic responsibility. Even more than its counterparts in Victoria and Western Australia, it has created a crisis in confidence in the ability of State governments to play an effective role in the revival of the regional and national economies. Because of such bad financial management we once again hear increasing rumblings about the lack of need for State governments in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Canberra has renewed my determination to regain for South Australia the reputation we once had for pride in our achievements, confidence in our future and prudence in economic management. I am going back there because I want to turn some of the negatives that I have been talking about into positives. It is a great challenge but I believe it can be done because we have in South Australia, per capita, the most skilled work force in the nation. We have a manufacturing and agricultural base which can and must be diversified to take account of being part of a more internationalised or global economy. We are a lucky State. We do not have to change our ways totally; the basis is there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Diversification is the key to answering the question on everybody's lips: where will the jobs come from in the future? For example, in South Australia, where so many jobs rely on the automotive industry, we ought to look urgently at diversifying far more into car components for diverse world markets rather than concentrating on the assembly stage for just one or two manufacturers. There is another example, with which I am sure no-one in this Chamber would disagree, and that is the wisdom of value adding for our agricultural base in South Australia.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Import replacement is as important as our export markets but it has not been happening. Either we have stood still in manufacturing and diversification or we have gone backwards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While John Bannon has been chasing grand prix he was not thinking of jobs for the future in our crucial automotive manufacturing area. He should have been doing both. While he was chasing expansion for the State Bank outside South Australia&mdash;and, outside Australia, he has been chasing the Commonwealth Games&mdash;he was not thinking of encouraging niche markets, new crops or value adding in agriculture. He should have been; it was possible and it was necessary that he should have been doing both. The need for such policy work is not new. It has been looming on the horizon as being essential for many years. However, I desist from pursuing a whole range of what I consider should be policy initiatives for the future. Some of those should remain for the election campaign, whenever that might be. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;By and large, the Opposition supports the Government's response, as it supported the findings of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. We do have some problems with the response and the findings, one of which is a major problem. There is no doubt that the two areas of health and employment in particular are the key areas on which Australia will be judged by its response.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the issues are much wider than that. The Royal Commission will stand as the monumental work to date in examining the position of Aboriginal Australians within the broader Australian society. Hopefully, it will be looked on as the time when Australia took the opportunity to form a partnership for the advancement of Aboriginal people. We should ensure that it will be looked on not as a lost opportunity and show us to be a nation which is too immature to put aside petty differences in order to achieve something of real benefit to the whole nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report to which the Government has responded is a frank and honest assessment of the attitudes of Aboriginal Australia, the position that Aboriginals occupy in our society and the attitudes of the broader Australian community. It is also a fairly frank examination of our past and why we are where we are today. It does not seek to instil guilt or apportion blame. The Opposition is pleased about that and believes that the breast beating and apportionment of blame are unnecessary and useless distractions from the main issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many areas this report coldly and clinically dissects the facts and lays them on the table for proper discussion. Commissioner Johnston, having spent many years of his life in this investigation, states in the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I say very frankly that when I started upon my work in this commission, I had some knowledge of the way broad policy had evolved to the detriment of Aboriginal people and some idea of the consequences. But until I examined the files of the people who died and the other material which has come before the Commission and listened to Aboriginal people speaking, I had no conception of the degree of pin-pricking domination, abuse of personal power, utter paternalism, open contempt and total indifference with which so many Aboriginal people were visited on a day to day basis. It's hard to convey the understanding, because each particular story takes time and space to tell.</PARA>
<PARA>Nonetheless, he did in fact take some time and space to tell it. As my colleague and spokesman on Aboriginal Affairs in the House of Representatives, Dr Wooldridge, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some years ago there was significant violence in the Kempsey area of New South Wales. The local council commissioned a report from a clinical psychologist into the basis of the violence and the racial tensions in the area. This report is illuminating reading. It states that the single most important factor in the poor race relations in the Kempsey area was the bitterness that the Aboriginal people felt. It was not bitterness for what happened 150 years ago or 100 years ago; it was bitterness for what happened in recent living memory.</PARA>
<PARA>This is one of the important issues that emerges from this report. It is all very well saying that the whole problem emerged from the way in which the early settlers dealt with and brutalised the Aboriginal people. This is a much more recent problem pointing to a whole number of needs to reverse recent attitudes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These attitudes are manifest and it is clear that many of them are only in the process of change. In New South Wales until 1964 an Aboriginal child could be actively excluded from school on the basis of race. In the Northern Territory until 1965 Aboriginal people needed permission to marry. In Western Australia until 1968 Aboriginal children were still being forcibly removed from their parents against the will of the parents. In Queensland until the mid-1960s Aborigines had to carry what was in effect a passport if they wanted to leave a reserve. If they were caught without such a document exempting them from the Aborigines Protection Act, they were arrested and returned to the reservation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legacy of all this is a population marginalised, dispersed, dispossessed and very poorly educated. The first Aboriginal man in Australia to graduate from university, Charles Perkins, did so in 1966. That should be compared with the fact that the first New Zealand Maori to do the same was in 1901, two generations earlier. It is incumbent on us in this Parliament to see that this petty tyranny, the pin-pricking domination and utter paternalism, of which Commissioner Johnston speaks in his report, is finally put behind us. In fact, we do not have any other choice because today the debate on Aboriginal affairs is an international one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Royal Commission came into being partly in response to a campaign which had been waged since 1984 by the Committee to Defend Black Rights. This Committee had been founded after widespread dissatisfaction with the verdict in the John Pat case in Western Australia. John Pat died in police custody in Roebourne in 1983, and the ABC focused national attention on this case and other deaths in custody in a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program in September 1985. That program drew angry responses from the Western Australian Police Union with accusations of bias and inaccuracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia was also subject to growing international pressure in the middle of 1987. For example, the London-based anti-slavery movement concluded a two-month study of Australia's Aboriginal population and reported:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Widespread allegations of physical and psychological abuse of Aborigines in custody. . . including young women and children.</PARA>
<PARA>No matter what the accuracy of like reports, they created world wide concerns. This particular report was tabled at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Vancouver. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Royal Commission was the last of a series of responses made by the Government to quell growing public anger. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs had been given a brief to inquire into Aboriginal involvement within the criminal justice system, but this lapsed on the calling of the 1987 election. Thus, with the growing number of deaths, in the end there was no choice and the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody was set up almost as a requirement in October 1987. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Royal Commission, however, has not been without its critics and throughout its three-year history has attracted its fair share of publicity. There is no doubt it was expensive; in the end it cost over $30m. In many ways, however, it was really 99 individual royal commissions as the commissioners were required to report individually on every one of the 99 deaths in custody. The Commission allowed us as a country, fortunately, during this expensive investigation to have some breathing space, a sort of circuit-breaker, which allowed us to really look at why so many Aborigines were in custody and why they appeared to be dying so frequently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The research in the report showed early on that Aborigines were 29 times more likely to be in gaol than non-Aborigines. But, for any given instance of imprisonment, the chance of an Aborigine dying in custody was actually slightly less than that of a European person. This is a key point that people must remember: Aborigines in custody are no more likely to die in custody than a non-Aboriginal person. So it was then that we had to look as a nation at other factors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was not so much then a problem of what happens after someone goes to gaol but rather the high numbers of Aboriginal people who are in gaol in the first place. The fact that Aborigines are 29 times more likely to be in prison than non-Aborigines, as was the case in 1987 and is still the case in many parts of Australia, makes Aboriginal people one of the most imprisoned races in the world. However, this figure is somewhat misleading because the age profile of Aboriginal people is significantly different from that of the general Australian population. The birth rate is higher and life expectancy is less. No doubt this skewed age profile would contribute towards this high imprisonment ratio. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, unfortunately, in the Royal Commission report the whole of the difference is consistently ascribed to race. That simply is self-evidently wrong. In other words, it ascribes that because someone is an Aborigine, he has a 29-times higher likelihood of being put in gaol. That is clearly not the situation. The report which makes this claim, in fact, reveals what the answer really is. It shows us something of the poverty in Aboriginal society. No doubt a good proportion of that huge increase in the prospects of an Aborigine being in gaol is due to poverty rather than Aboriginality. How much so we do not know because that is an inadequate area of examination by the Royal Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would have been interesting to look at imprisonment rates in non-Aboriginal poverty areas to make a proper comparison. This was not done. Had it been done, I suspect we would have found that a good part of this larger proportion of Aborigines in custody could be explained by poverty. It is a pity that this study was not done because so much of the debate today is on technical methods to keep Aborigines out of gaol, whereas it might have been on ways of addressing Aboriginal poverty as a preventive measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does the Royal Commission tell us of these 99 people who died in custody?  This I believe is the major issue. It is, in fact, a rather chilling profile. Of the 99 people, 88 were males and 11 were females. The mean age at the time of death was 32. Of the 99, only two had completed secondary education and only one had completed vocational training at TAFE. Eighty three were unemployed at the time of their last detention&mdash;and I am interested to see the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) nod his head; that is, in my view, the essential matter. Forty three had been separated as children from their natural families by the action of government&mdash;and that certainly could be an element, but fortunately a disappearing one. In Western Australia and Queensland, over half had been separated from their natural families; in New South Wales just on half. Of the 99, 37 had died of natural causes while in gaol; the average age of those dying in this way was 30. So the health of this group of people ranged from poor to very poor&mdash;another factor as to why, other than race, there was this huge proportion of Aboriginal people dying in custody and being in gaol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the 339 recommendations themselves. These cover an enormous variety of areas. Many are purely custodial in nature and cover areas as diverse as relations with the police, youth and justice, diversion of arrest, bail issues, courts, custody and Aboriginal legal services. These generally receive unanimous support by the Commonwealth and Territory governments. Other recommendations relate to all areas of endeavour in Aboriginal affairs, housing and infrastructure through health, jobs and schooling. On issues relating to law and justice, the recommendations are unexceptionable and sensible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the recommendations relating to diversion from arrest, bail and representation before the court are ones which really should apply, however, to the whole community, not just the Aboriginal segment of it. This applies particularly to bail issues, breath testing of people taken into custody, and families of deceased being entitled to legal representation at coronial inquiries. That these recommendations should have wider application does not mean we do not support their introduction for Aboriginal people. It simply means that we hope that governments at all levels might look at their broader application. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of health the recommendations made are generally sensible and desirable. In fact, some of the recommendations are long overdue. Recommendation 45 proposing a special national survey of the social, demographic, health and economic characteristics of Australia's Aboriginal population is welcomed. Such a survey should be carried out in conjunction with a census so that it would provide the most meaningful data. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In so much of Aboriginal affairs, our endeavour has been merely based on guesswork or anecdotal evidence. We have to be honest with ourselves as to whether or not our policies are achieving what we wish them to, and this special survey will give us a basis on which we can determine our benchmarks and look at our successes or otherwise in the programs for the future. Some of the recommendations have been overtaken by events. For example, recommendation 339 states that all governments support the process of reconciliation&mdash;and this has now happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority of other recommendations from the Royal Commission relate to ATSIC and those Aboriginal education programs within DEET. The majority of these appear relevant and sensible. The agreement by the Commonwealth and States on the majority of them reflects the fact that there is a growing agreement as to what is successful and what is not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, one part of the report has the potential to cause major conflict. This conflict may be more perceived than real and may not be insurmountable. It relates to recommendation 188, which talks about ensuring that the self-determination principle is applied in the design and implementation of any policy. The Opposition is not inclined to open up old wounds, but this matter is very serious so far as we are concerned. The report talks a great deal about self-determination; indeed, it comes through every single volume of the report. In the overview, Commissioner Johnston, when talking of the requirements to adhere to the principles of self-determination, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a concept which&mdash;I think&mdash;does not have a precise definition.</PARA>
<PARA>The problem is that Commissioner Johnston is just plain wrong. The principle of self-determination has a specific and precise meaning in international law. It is contained in the first article of the United Nations Charter of 1945 and also in the first article of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The United Nations Charter states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to develop friendly relations among nations, based on respect for the principles of equal rights and self-determination of peoples . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All peoples have the right to self-determination. By virtue of that right, they freely determine their political status.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In both these texts, the word `peoples' was chosen over contending terms of minorities or nations. In international law, indigenous peoples are not a people for the meaning of these two texts. There are people of Kuwait who have a right to self-determination, but that applies to the nation as a whole, not a minority within it, for example&mdash;even an indigenous minority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not just of historical interest. In the draft declaration of the Working Group on Indigenous Peoples, the usage of the word `peoples' is specifically precluded by the United Nations from conferring the rights associated with the word in international law. The demand for self-determination for the Aboriginal people in Australia is thus inextricably tied up with international law, with the idea of an independent sovereign state. It is not adapted to degrees of autonomy less than a full autonomous self-government. We can talk of degrees of autonomy and devolution, but there are no degrees of sovereign statehood. Thus, the idea of self-determination within the wider state or under a wider law is in itself contradictory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be much easier to pretend that self-determination or the principle of self-determination meant whatever one wished it to mean and that there was room for argument. But in international law self-determination applies to sovereign states, and neither the Labor Party nor the coalition has ever suggested that we should be talking about dividing Australia's sovereignty. I suspect that the concept that we talk of in self-management and the concept the Government talks of in self-determination are similar concepts but using different words. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Royal Commission talks of policies of self-determination over the last 20 years, it fails to recognise that these have been policies of one political party. It has not been a continuous policy of successive governments, nor a continuing policy of successive State governments. However, it has been a policy of Labor State and Federal governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition believes that it is desirable for Aboriginal people, in matters relating to their own internal and local affairs, to have the greatest possible degree of autonomy, consistent with obligations to the broader community. Our support for ATSIC and our long held policy position that Aboriginal people have the right, as a right, to choose to live a traditional lifestyle and to preserve their culture, support our view that when Aboriginal people have control over these matters that affect their day-to-day lives, they have by far the greatest chance of developing self-reliance, independence, dignity and choice. There is in international law an emerging concept of internal self-determination. Perhaps in the future this will offer us a way out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other areas of concern about the Royal Commission report and the Government response to it. I raise these as concerns, not as criticisms, in the hope that they can provide a constructive point of view as to the limitations that the coalition sees with the approach being taken at the moment. These concerns relate to three areas: the first is the limitation of government; the second is the challenge of helping Aboriginal people move from a welfare dependant state; and the third is the administration of Aboriginal affairs and Aboriginal organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government alone will never solve the challenge facing Aboriginal Australians. This is clearly recognised in the Royal Commission where, in the overview, Commissioner Johnston talks of three essential prerequisites to Aboriginal people having control over their lives and their communities. His first essential prerequisite, and the most crucial, is the desire and capacity of Aboriginal people to put an end to their disadvantaged situation and to take control of their lives. He says that there can be no other way. Only the Aboriginal people can in the final analysis ensure their own future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second prerequisite is assistance from the broad society, and this basically means assistance from government with the support of the electorate or at least without its opposition. According to the Commissioner, the third prerequisite is having in place an established method and procedure whereby the broader society can supply the assistance and the Aboriginal society can receive it without a welfare dependant position being established between the two groups. In effect, Commissioner Johnston is talking about a partnership between the Australian Government, the Aboriginal people and the broader community; and there is simply no other way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By and large, the rest of the report relates to what government can or should do. This is a pity because no amount of governmental assistance in Aboriginal education, for example, will be successful if Aboriginal parents still do not want to send their children to school. No amount of money spent on programs to combat petrol sniffing or substance abuse will work unless the community wishes to take responsibility for what is going on in its midst. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that we yet have a partnership in this country. It is what we desperately need and what we should work towards. If we have a belief, as I seem to read in the Royal Commission report or seem to read in the Government's response to this stage, that the Government alone has the capacity to turn this around, then we are wrong and we will fail, as we have failed previously. Money alone will not fix the problem. Money is important for what it can achieve in real, tangible, positive benefits on the ground for Aboriginal people. In all of the discussions of the report and the Government's response to it, accountability relates to the way we spend the money but not so much on what the money actually achieves. In the majority of instances where ATSIC and DEET have performance indicators, these performance indicators relate to the timely disbursement of money, not what the money achieves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is where we have to have a total turnaround in thinking in this nation. We will miss the point on real accountability if we are merely talking about spending the money. The question has to be: are we being effective in what we are doing? The only issue must be: does it work? I must say that we have a long way to go on this score. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another concern is: how do we help Aboriginal people move from the position where they are dependent on government to a position where they are self-reliant? Until we face up to this, all other issues are secondary. We understand that the Minister is to make a speech in three months time, after discussions with the States, involving a further report when this issue will be addressed. The Opposition is pleased to note that the Royal Commission mentions this in its introduction. Unfortunately, the concept seems to get lost after that introduction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we say, it is not an issue of money. No-one in his right mind will say that another $50m a year will make the difference either way between welfare dependence and self-reliance. The problem here fundamentally is one of attitude, on both sides: the attitude in the broader Australian community to supply the support needed for Aboriginal people, not just financial support, but encouragement, patience and understanding for Aboriginal people to develop an economic base. It may also require a change in attitude in many Aboriginal people. As Commissioner Johnston said, there is the desire to put an end to their disadvantaged situation and take control of their own lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition looks forward to the Minister's response in three months time and seeing how the Government will help Aboriginal people develop an independent economic base. After the development of a partnership, development of an economic base is the greatest challenge we face. If we do not face it, self-management or self-determination&mdash;whatever we want to call it&mdash;is reduced to talking about how Aborigines control the government money given to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area of concern relates to the administration of programs and Aboriginal organisations. This is vital because these are the vehicles by which benefits pass to people in the community. Aboriginal programs in the Department of Employment, Education and Training appear to be a real shambles. In recent years, successive reports by the Auditor-General on DEET programs have shown insufficient verification checks for applications, insufficient information on clients' application forms, a lack of coordination with other departments and no procedures to avoid the duplication of payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most recent Auditor-General's report stated that auditing was not undertaken in relation to $80m worth of expenditure under Aboriginal education supplementary assistance because auditing had revealed that departmental records were not adequate to determine whether payments were valid or accurate. DEET accepted this. In its own words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sufficient documentary evidence was unable to be located to support the expenditure relating to this program.</PARA>
<PARA>We are talking about $80m a year. Accountability has to start at home. Unless the Federal Government can be accountable for its own expenditure in these departments that it has control over, we cannot reasonably ask for the same sort of accountability within Aboriginal organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The biggest initiatives in the Government's response to the report were in the areas of Aboriginal legal services. The extra funding to meet the main recommendations of the Royal Commission will be channelled through Aboriginal legal services. Yet Aboriginal legal services are structures that are not open and transparent. Many produce no annual reports, despite their being repeatedly requested to do so. ATSIC, itself, generally has no idea whether the money it is handing over is being used effectively and wisely. It hands it over, closes its eyes, crosses its fingers and hopes it will work. Not long ago, ATSIC had to take the New South Wales Aboriginal Legal Service to court to recover $94,000 that a couple of its directors had spent on a one-week jaunt around England. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the report in general. The Government's response is a monumental work. Collating 339 responses from eight governments is no easy feat. The Opposition commends the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Mr Tickner, for his work on this. On the Federal level, we often disagree with the Government. However, we have made an effort to look for common ground, and we have found much of it. Nevertheless, it is disappointing that the response of so many of the States has appeared to be self-serving and publicity seeking. They have not taken the same initiative that we have tried to take at a Federal level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report offers a great opportunity to take a step forward. We really must take advantage of it. The Opposition believes that we need a framework for a significantly new approach to the administration of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs under the next coalition government to address Aboriginal disadvantage, based on a partnership between the Australian Government and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. We particularly need to address clear objectives such as an improvement in Aboriginal health, the provision of housing and infrastructure, Aboriginal education, Aboriginal economic development and cultural survival. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must understand that if Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders are to be given the opportunity to move from dependence on welfare and government to a position of self-reliance, it is essential that they be given the opportunity to develop a sound economic base. We must recognise the importance of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander participation in the decisions which affect their lives and the determination of local priorities. There must be an absolute requirement for a focus on outcomes rather than outputs; open and transparent decision making; organisations receiving government money to provide services in an efficient and equitable manner; and accountability at all levels of service delivery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this will need a decentralised administration with devolution of decision making powers at a local level, effective performance and accountability arrangements and the clarification of the role of the Minister and his or her relationship with ATSIC. We believe that such an approach will go a long way towards creating a fairer and more coherent program for Aboriginal Australia. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Access to the pensioner rebate is restricted to persons receiving a full or part Australian age or service pension. The level of pensioner rebate received is determined by the level of taxable income of the pensioner. The pensioner rebate is calculated to enable pensioners to earn income up to the income test free area and pay no income tax. The rebate then reduces by 12.5 cents for each dollar of taxable income in excess of this level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the income test for the pensioner rebate were removed, so that access to the full pensioner rebate was extended to all persons aged 65 years and over, the estimated cost to revenue of the extension would be $275 million in 1991-92.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If access to the pensioner rebate were extended to all persons aged 65 years and over on the basis of the current income test, the estimated cost to revenue of the extension would be $60 million in 1991-92.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Department of Defence supported the investigation by making available officers and information required by the investigating team.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The operational authority of the patrol boat force in northern Australia was briefed to be aware of the possible arrival of a boatload of illegal entrants and that information was in turn passed on to the patrol boats. Patrol boats are available at all times to assist the civil authorities and the only impediments to gaining that assistance are usually weather, the urgency of the request, and the time and distance equation between the patrol boat and the location concerned. In this particular case, HMAS CESSNOCK, was directed to the vessel and members of the ship's company searched the vessel and the immediate area of the landing. Aside from evidence of the landing no entrants were found as they had moved inland by this stage. In assessing the value of this contribution, the use of a patrol boat was the most expeditious means available in the circumstances and the search was effective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) As noted in 2 above, the operational authority of the patrol boat force in northern Australia was briefed to be aware of the possible arrival of a boatload of illegal entrants and that information was in turn passed on to the patrol boats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) From the Defence perspective it is considered that the planning of the use of ADF units in the civil surveillance program has reached a high degree of efficiency. Officers from the major headquarters of the ADF and their civilian equivalents, meet on a formal basis each month in Canberra to match the bids for support from the civil agencies with the Defence and civil resources available. In reality, there is inevitably a gap between the resources available and the bids received but this is managed by making judgments on the priority of each request. With regard to the operational integration of Coastwatch and the ADF, major improvements in the processing of requests for assistance have been made in the past few years. The passage of operational information between Coastwatch aircraft and Navy patrol boats has also been improved with a special communications plan and it is intended to improve communications security with the purchase of data encryption devices for the patrol boat force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) As is indicated in the Report, Defence provided relevant information to Coastwatch.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) A person who had no gap payments in the first half of 1991, and who reached the safety net limit of $246 in the second half of 1991 could be faced with further payments of up to $246 in the period 1 January to 31 December 1992 before the safety net again took effect. To the extent that a person who reached the safety net threshold did so because of costs incurred in the second half of the relevant accounting period this situation is no different from the arrangements which have applied since 1984.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) This means that over the twelve month period July 1991 to June 1992 some individuals may be paying as much as $492 in gap costs. This occurrence would be possible under any safety net arrangement which operated on an annual basis if a twelve month period is selected which does not coincide with the basis of the safety net. For this reason it is important to look at the out of pocket expenses incurred over a broader timeframe. In the case outlined by Senator Newman, no more than $492 would be paid over the entire period from 1 January 1991 to 31 December 1992, a total of 24 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has made substantial improvements to the Medicare safety net by extending its provisions to cover registered families on the same basis that individuals were previously covered. The main reason for the shift from a financial year to a calendar year was to enable early introduction of this major improvement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The change in the safety net to a calendar year basis was introduced retrospectively from 1 January 1991 to minimise the potential for individuals to feel disadvantaged. The retrospective introduction of the calendar year basis ensures that for services provided in the 1991 calendar year, no individual will have paid more than $246 in gap costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From 1 January 1992 the safety net was extended to include gap costs incurred by family members rather than just individuals. This change will mean that many people, including those who reached the safety net threshold in the latter half of 1991 are likely to reach the threshold earlier in the safety net accounting year than they would have under the previous individual safety net provisions. They and their families will be subsequently covered for the rest of the calendar year. </PARA>
