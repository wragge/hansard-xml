We are persons who recognise the Holy Bible as the infallible Word of God, its teaching is mandatory and provides every help and practical guidance.

<TITLE>Drug Use</TITLE>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth; that we support your efforts to strengthen our family and community life particularly by increased penalties for "drug pushers" and distributors. We, however, wish to register our firm opposition to any legal changes which would increase or encourage the distribution or availability of so-called "soft drugs" such as marijuana. We believe such drugs to be harmful to the physical and psychological health of the individual and therefore to the interest of the community of which such individual is part. Although there is current controversy concerning the question of such harm it appears to us quite foolish to legalise and encourage the use of such drugs unless or until it be shown that such drugs are in fact harmless. The serious social problems of alcohol should provide sufficient warning to our society.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any efforts to legalise or decriminalise usage or distribution of such drugs will have the following results:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">1. Encourage and inculcate a social acceptability towards such drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">2. Increase the volume of usage of such drugs in schools and the community by present users and by "drug pushers" through the proposed one ounce legal possession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">3. Extend the usage of such drugs to persons who would previously have abstained because of the legal sanctions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">4. Put pressure upon Parliament to establish and license import, growth, manufacture and/or distribution of such drugs, that is, to regulate another destructive industry contrary to the best interest of the individual and society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">5. There would be the probable temptation to tax such drugs as another source of Federal revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We urge the Government to increase the medical and counselling facilities for the assistance of drug users and to expand existing Drug Referral Centres and Clinics. We have general confidence in the existing law and its sympathetic implementation by the Police and Courts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that your honourable House will firstly take no measures that could extend the major social problem of drug usage and secondly will oblige those who are promoting marijuana and/or similar drugs to prove without doubt that such drugs are harmless before any legalisation or decriminalisation of use is introduced.</PARA>

<PARA>This is an incredible attempt by the Government today to ram through this chamber fundamental changes to the industrial relations system in Australia. The matter concerns the attempt by this Government to take from the Victorian Government at least part of its industrial relations responsibility. This is a political exercise undertaken by the Government to try to demonstrate some failure on behalf of the Victorian Government, which was overwhelmingly elected to put right the terrible economic situation which it inherited in that State. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is one thing to run a political argument, but it is intolerable to abuse the processes of this place in order to pursue that argument. That is what the Government has done. It is seeking to take up a matter that has been on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> for some time and to attach to it these very fundamental changes, which are perhaps some of the most significant changes to the industrial relations structure in this country in the last 90 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were given these amendments 24 hours ago. There is no Minister's second reading speech available; there is no explanatory memorandum. It has not gone to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. There obviously has been no allowance for the Opposition parties in this place to process it properly through their shadow Ministry, through their party room. Has this ever occurred before in the history of this Senate? Has there ever been an attempt by a government to ram a political opportunity through this place and so abuse the processes of the Senate? I know of no occurrence such as this in the past. It is something that is shameful and inexcusable on the part of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are seeking by this suspension of Standing Orders to allow the Senate to place this item of business on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> so that it can be dealt with this parliamentary session and be processed properly by the Opposition. We have a party room meeting scheduled for Wednesday, when the House of Representatives comes back.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This chamber, which is the House of review and which is charged with giving full and proper scrutiny to these matters, should have the advice of its committee process.

For us to have called a special Party meeting and brought our members of the House of Representatives back to Canberra today would have been a totally irresponsible way of spending taxpayers' money and would have been totally unjustified.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have again seen an example of the Democrats taking a position and, within 15 minutes, because they had a visitation, changing their minds as to the position they were going to take. In fact, I have just had a minor dispute with one of my own colleagues because no-one in this chamber has seen these amendments, except for a few of us who have received them through the good graces of Senator McMullan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an absolutely appalling situation that amendments of this magnitude are brought into this place without an explanatory memorandum or a second reading speech from the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook). These amendments go to the very heart of federalism in this country and raise a whole series of questions about constitutional validity. I will give an example. An amendment to the objects of the Industrial Relations Act is taken partly from our Federal Constitution&mdash;a Constitution which, incidentally, a whole bunch of people opposite want to destroy. Section 51(xxxv) of the Constitution says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">51. The Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to:-</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(xxxv.)  Conciliation and arbitration for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State:</PARA>
<PARA>In the amendment brought in by the Government, the words `extending beyond the limits of any one State' are omitted. That raises the question of constitutional validity, and it is the responsibility of this Parliament to assure itself that the legislation it passes is constitutionally valid. I am not sure about that with these amendments, and many other people are not sure about it. Until we have the opportunity to investigate that, it is most improper that this Government should pursue these amendments. It is being done simply on the basis of Paul paying back Wally Curran and John Halfpenny because they supported him in the assassination of Bob Hawke&mdash;which is what it is all about. Everyone knows that it is about maintaining the power of Trades Hall in Victoria, a trades hall which has the worst reputation in this country because of the way it has participated in the management of the Victorian Government over the past 10 years and has been the contributor to the destruction of that State. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that the amendments to the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992 be deferred until Wednesday to give everyone the opportunity to study them in detail.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can hear them yabbering, but they are speaking a different language, which is not unusual. It is important that we support the suspension of Standing Orders so that this legislation, which, as my colleague Senator Hill said, will make the most profound change in industrial relations in this country for 90 years, can be properly debated and not rammed through this place by the sort of standover union bully tactics that Government senators are well versed in.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot let the phrase `rammed through' go without comment. The legislation in Victoria was rammed through the Victorian Parliament. As a result, it is generally conceded that that industrial relations legislation is extremely faulty. Indeed, it imposes draconian measures not only on the people directly affected but on the people of Victoria as a whole. I mention that in passing; it has nothing to do with the motion that Standing Orders be suspended for the purpose of allowing Senator Hill to move his motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am going to support the suspension of Standing Orders, but I will oppose part of Senator Hill's motion when it comes forward. I do not think that we need three sitting days to consider the amendments because that will take us to Wednesday next week. But I acknowledge what Senator McMullan has said, which is that the Government is proposing not to have the Senate consider the committee stage until next week and until the matter goes before the relevant parliamentary committee. That is a reasonable proposition. But the second reading stage of the Bill enables members of parliament to state their views on the principles governing the measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have thought deeply about this question. I have always been of the view that once we get outside the conciliation and arbitration powers of the Commonwealth, when it comes to industrial legislation we are opening gates which may not be able to be closed if and when another government comes into power. Thus, I am very strongly opposed to the use of the corporations power, as an example, to be relied upon for amendments to industrial legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I clearly see the need for this Parliament, in some way, to overcome the situation that exists in Victoria where workers are denied the opportunity to go to the independent umpire. I have a difficulty, because for many years I have opposed strenuously the use of the external affairs power for purposes other than those for which it was originally designed in the Constitution. I am still deeply concerned about that matter and I am consulting fairly widely on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this stage I am not in a position to deliver any views in a speech today on that aspect. That is one of the reasons that I am supporting the proposal by Senator Hill for a suspension of Standing Orders. But I make it perfectly clear that, if necessary, at the end of the day this Parliament must do something to protect the livelihoods of those who have been so grievously wronged in Victoria. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This morning we have heard from the man who passes for the Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Senator McMullan, a poor excuse that says that we can somehow discuss an amendment which goes to the fundamental nature of a Bill without an explanatory memorandum. The reasons we have explanatory memorandums are enshrined in much literature. He is saying that we can get up in this chamber and talk about legislation which is not even fully available for senators to examine and discuss.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind honourable senators that when we rise to speak in a second reading debate we are actually addressing a Bill and its amendments. We need the full documentation before us to know precisely what we are discussing; otherwise we would simply rise in here to discuss a motion that it would be a good idea if we had some legislation on a particular topic. That is not what the procedure is about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Harradine mentioned the powers that are relied upon in order to bring in legislation which purports to be within the powers conferred on this Parliament, and they concern a very serious parliamentary question. It is one which clearly the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) does not know, comprehend or care about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We say in this chamber that we are a House of review. We have a group of people over here who call themselves the Australian Democrats, who like to say that they consider things on their merits. Clearly they are not doing that this morning. If they had any clear understanding of the way in which the Parliament works, they would say, `Without the explanatory memorandum before this Parliament, we cannot proceed to a proper speech in a second reading debate'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have often said in this place, `You cannot buy the Democrats, but you can certainly rent them by the half hour'. It would seem at this stage that we should ask them precisely what deal has been done here today. What other legislation or advantage are they going to get as a result of agreeing to proceed in this way? It is very disappointing. Don Chipp used to say that they were here to keep the bastards honest. I ask honourable senators: who these days are the bastards and who is keeping whom honest?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;She had a conversation two minutes before they got up and said that they were going to agree with the Government, but a conversation took place between the Minister and the Democrats following her conversation. So we are in this disgraceful situation where proper debate of serious legislation with full constitutional implications is being treated as a farce. Once again, there has been that little deal between the Democrats and the Government because the Government has given some commitment to Mr Kelty&mdash;the unnamed member of the Cabinet&mdash;that this legislation will be delivered on a particular date.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ugly face of trade unionism is again showing itself here and setting the agenda in this Parliament&mdash;and those trade unionists are not elected. The only trade unionist who is elected in this place that we know of publicly is the Minister&mdash;and we frequently do not know whether he speaking on behalf of the BWIU or as a Minister of State. We are seeing the ugly face of trade unionism dictating the agenda in this chamber so that we are not even in the position of having the full documentation before honourable senators to commence this important debate on legislation that is bound to end up in the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, we have even passed the Acts Interpretation Act in this place so that courts are entitled to take note of explanatory memoranda and second reading speeches as a determining factor in interpreting legislation, yet we are in the position where we do not have the correct documentation to properly debate those important issues. As my Deputy Whip has pointed out to me, the Democrats did agree with us and then changed their minds and agreed with the Government. We ask ourselves: why is it so? Given the seriousness of what has been done here this morning, the Australian people will have to make a judgment about whether a contribution is truly made in this chamber by people who purport to consider things on merit but are obviously available for a deal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Comment has been made about the Constitution and what is legal under that document. One of the most influential awards in Australia, and happily so for employers, has long been a Federal award&mdash;ever since about 1929&mdash;covering the metal manufacturing industry. What we propose is not to go away from the Constitution but, under a provision which has not been questioned up until this time, to widen that provision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition talks about the extension of a dispute beyond the boundaries of one State. The facts are that there have been many disputes in enterprises in Australia that were wholly within a State. Because of their connection with the metal trades employers and the Federal award, those disputes have been dealt with by the Federal commission&mdash;of course, always with the approval of those on the other side of the chamber. Those opposite talk about the Government being in an enormous hurry to get this legislation through the chamber. This is a response from a ramming through by the Kennett Government of those sorts of provisions that will take away wages and conditions from workers that they fought and argued for in the Arbitration Commission, given to them by the umpire and as requested by the Opposition over the whole 31 years of government by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite talk about our proposition as though we are forcing something on somebody. I guess the legislation would take away the right to dictatorially put conditions on workers as the Kennett Government has done. We are saying to workers that we will provide the opportunity for them to come across to a Federal award. If they wish to do that, they will; if they do not, they will stay with the State position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the colonies as they were before Federation, all of the provisions that covered employment&mdash;there were not a great number of them because at that time we were not very sophisticated in that area&mdash;were State provisions.

There is not any doubt that the type of people who sit across the chamber today are the same type of people who decided that Federal awards should be brought into existence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating three Bills together: the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992, the Coal Industry Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 and the International Labour Organisation (Compliance with Conventions) Bill 1992. I will separately address the three subjects.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industrial Chemicals Amendment Bill acts on the recommendations of a consultant's report on the practical business effect of the national industrial chemicals notification and assessment scheme. In 1989 a Hawke Government Act set up a scheme for the regulation of industrial chemicals. The consultants appointed by the Government to gauge the industry's response to the scheme reported that there should be less regulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three specific areas have been covered in this Bill. There is still insufficient recognition of foreign assessment of chemicals. However, Australia is still reinventing the wheel too often, and there must be an impetus to a system which will accept a proper assessment from abroad without requiring a completely new assessment for use in this country&mdash;another example of unnecessary duplication. Clause 8 of the Bill creates an amnesty period. I understand that an amendment has been put in by the Government which will set the amnesty period at two years, rather than doing so by regulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a national register of chemicals since at least 1977. However, business has sometimes failed to use the register. The Industrial Chemicals Act 1989 provided for heavy criminal sanctions for those businesses which introduced chemicals into Australia without first submitting information to the Director of Chemicals Notification and Assessment. Some companies, aware of the register, were nevertheless misinformed by their foreign suppliers about the constituents of imported chemical products, and some chemicals were overlooked. The inventory was formally closed in February 1990, making it impossible for companies to take any steps after that time to put themselves within the law. It has taken the Government another three years to get its house in order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition suggests that the Government should learn from the failure of the publicity campaign following the 1989 Act and create a kit to help businesses identify their duties under the law. There is an eligible chemical category which provides for chemicals which could have been registered on the Australian inventory but which were not. It will be merely necessary to prove that the company in question was manufacturing or importing the chemicals before the inventory closed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consultants to Worksafe Australia, working with the industry, have proposed two further areas of amendments to the 1989 Act. The first amendment relates to industrial chemicals to be used in small amounts only. Low volumes of chemicals, often imported as minor constituents of a complex chemical product, are unlikely to create a threat to health or to the broader environment. The cheaper and faster processes which are available under the Bill can make a difference between profit and loss for a product with only very limited sales opportunities or potential. Of course, if the chemical is imported in amounts that bring it into the usual volume categories, the regular provisions and sanctions of the Act will apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second area of reform recommended by the consultants to Worksafe covered a radical simplification of the process of assessment of those chemicals known as polymers of low concern. These polymers are those synthetic polymers with characteristics that satisfy the regulations to be made under this Bill. Typically, they will be extremely stable, non-volatile and non-susceptible to easy transfer across biological membranes. Polymers filling this bill are most unlikely to make for a threat to public health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chemical industry remains concerned at the slow progress of changes to the national chemicals industry notification assessment scheme concerning the importation of chemicals recognised by appropriate organisations overseas. The coalition shares the concerns expressed by the industry. We also call on the Government to work with industry to encourage the use of published reports prepared by the exporting country when considering whether to accept a chemical for export into this country. It is pointless and a waste of public money to prepare extensive reports for the national chemical scheme under the principal Act when there may be perfectly acceptable research from the exporting country on which Australia may make a rapid decision on import permission. It has all the earmarks of a continuing make-work program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reporting scheme requires the payment of hefty fees, making delays in the assessment process yet another cost to industry. There is a point at which the importer will say, `Why should I bother making the product or using the process if the red tape over chemical assessment makes the whole business proposition a marginal one?'. The Liberal and National parties understand that the industry, through the Australian Chemical Industry Council, is discussing the question of recognition of assessments prepared by the exporting country or another country to remove the need for doubling up of the work in this country. Let us hope that the Government gives support to those discussions so that Australia does not do what it has done so often under this Labor Government, and that is cut off its employment nose to spite its regulatory face. The coalition will not be opposing the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second Bill we are debating is the Coal Industry Legislation Amendment Bill 1992. It provides for amendments to the Coal Industry Act 1946 and the Industrial Relations Act 1988. The aim of the Bill is to transfer administrative support for the Coal Industry Tribunal from the Joint Coal Board to the Australian Industrial Registry. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) noted in his second reading speech that the Bill does not in any way alter the Tribunal's powers and functions and he has commenced a process of consultation with a view to making changes to those powers and functions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is a gutless wimp-out of yet another opportunity to reform our most major export industry in Australia. The question of whether the Joint Coal Board&mdash;which includes the Coal Industry Tribunal&mdash;should continue to exist was examined by the Industry Commission, which recommended that the Coal Board be disbanded and any necessary ongoing functions be allocated to other bodies. This view was rejected by the Government, not because it did not believe it was well overdue but because the militant trade union movement would not have a bar of it. At one time, Senator Cook was responsible for resources. He would know the intransigence of those union people in what should be the modern updating of this industry. Everyone in the industry knows, and has known for two decades, that the Coal Industry Tribunal is an anachronism. Successive governments have regrettably shied away from abolishing it. I am not entirely sheeting the blame home to those opposite because it goes back 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In February 1987, the Coal Association produced a comprehensive 72-page document entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A case for change</EMPHASIS> relating to the Coal Industry Tribunal. The thrust of the submission was to return the industry to mainstream industrial relations as an essential requirement for the future health and viability of our most important export industry. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Cook. Historically, the Coal Industry Tribunal&mdash;it is worth going back to show what an anachronism it is&mdash;was established in 1946 by the then Minister for Post-War Reconstruction. I would have thought&mdash;I am sure Senator Cook will agree&mdash;that we are past those days. The Tribunal arose out of anarchy in the coalmines when Australia was going through its most troubled time in history, the Second World War. The Joint Coal Board and the Coal Industry Tribunal were supposed to solve the problems of the coal industry in New South Wales. It did not work then, as evidenced by the Chifley Government bringing troops into the mines. It has never worked, yet successive governments have not addressed the problem, and neither has this Government, although it has moved in the right direction to some degree. For that reason, we will not be opposing the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned earlier, coal is our largest single export, with over $7 billion worth of coal going to 30 different countries around the world. We mine about 160 million tonnes of coal and export around 120 million tonnes per year. Despite the best efforts of the Whitlam Government and the mentor of the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating), Mr Connor, to stop the growth of that industry, it has become Australia's leading exporter. Without this industry, Australia would be in diabolical trouble. Australia is in bad enough trouble as it is, but it would be entirely down the gurgler without this industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is important&mdash;I have said this on a number of occasions&mdash;to keep the whole thing in perspective. Australia is not the only producer and exporter of coal in the world. If we read the popular press and listen to some of the idiotic remarks made by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories, Mrs Kelly, or Senator Coulter, we would think it was. While it is our major export industry, it pales into insignificance compared with countries such as the United States and China. Whereas we export some 80 per cent of our production, those countries consume most of their coal domestically. Our production of around 160 million tonnes becomes insignificant compared with the one billion tonnes produced in both China and the United States. Over the next few years China plans to increase its production from one billion to 1.4 billion tonnes simply to meet its own anticipated demand for energy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all right for people in Australia to talk about carbon levels and all those sorts of things in the enjoyment of their own armchairs where they can flick a switch and the electricity comes on, but it is very different to be in a place such as China where people walk around with hurricane lamps. Those people would quite properly like to be able to flick a switch and have the same comforts that these armchair extreme environmentalists have in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These statistics are not meant to downplay the importance of the coal industry in Australia&mdash;far from it. They are meant to highlight some of the nonsense, as I mentioned earlier, spoken by people such as Minister Kelly and Senator Coulter. Every time a silly remark is made about carbon taxes and so on, it leads to nervous customers not just in the power and cement industry but also in the world's steel industries. Our very poor record in industrial relations has led to diversification. Every time a stupid remark is made by these people just to attract a few minority lunatic groups in our society, it is to the detriment of our most important export industry and thus to every person in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last month we saw the biggest balance of payments deficit for three years&mdash;$1.8 billion&mdash;and our gross foreign debt was in excess of $200 billion. Without our coal exports of $7 billion a year to the world's steel, power, cement and chemical industries, Australia would be in the hands of the receivers; yet we have irresponsible people&mdash;people who should know better&mdash;in this Parliament making remarks which are to the detriment of their own country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Executive Director of the Australian Coal Association, Meredith Hellicar, has warned that despite productivity increases of 70 per cent between 1980 and 1990, labour cost increases have outstripped productivity improvements. That is worth dwelling on because that in itself shows the failure of the centralised industrial system in this country. We cannot go on having labour cost increases in excess of productivity. It is inevitable if that occurs that we will see more and more mines shutting down and more and more countries supplying the coal that currently comes from Australia. Over that 10-year period productivity increased by 70 per cent, with labour increases greater. So much for the award restructuring, the accord and micro-economic reform!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who argue that a reduction in the value of the dollar by 15 per cent will benefit the industry are ignoring two vital factors: firstly, the capital equipment, most of which is imported, will cost more; and, secondly, with reduced demand on overseas markets&mdash;that currently is the position&mdash;Australian coal suppliers will be very hard pressed to maintain last year's prices in the coming negotiations. I know that everyone would like to encourage them not only to maintain their old prices but also to increase them. We have to be realistic and very cautious because it is important that nothing we say here should in any way affect their negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is appalling that because of the constraints of time caused by the Labor Government, which is incapable of organising its own business properly and which has brought Australia to the brink of ruin, we are limited in engaging in a full scale debate on our single most important export industry. The Opposition is of the opinion that yet again the Government has wimped out in addressing the functions of the Joint Coal Board and the Coal Industry Tribunal. However, as I mentioned earlier, as it is a step in the right direction, the coalition will not oppose the Bill. As has been indicated in the coalition's Fightback package, the Joint Coal Board will be abandoned on the coalition being elected to government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I refer to the International Labour Organisation (Compliance with Conventions) Bill 1992. The Bill seeks to amend the Migration Act 1958 and the Navigation Act 1912. With regard to the Migration Act, the Bill makes inconsequential amendments to provisions relating to the production of identity documents and mustering of crew, the production of identity documents by persons on board resource installations, and production of identity documents by persons on board sea installations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past, with regard to foreign crews coming to Australia, the system has been that the Customs official would go aboard the ship and the skipper or the master would have all the documents. Now the individual will hold the documents and there will be a line-up so that&mdash;I presume for our benefit&mdash;the Customs official can see that the documents line up with the crew member when the ship arrives and that the same documents line up when he leaves. So we have no opposition to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the Navigation Act, the Bill seeks to make amendments to provisions for adequate storage of water and food, adequate catering facilities and regulations to give effect to the Medical Examination (Seafarers) Convention. We have no concerns with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have indicated, the amendments appear to the coalition to be of an administrative nature, given the current agenda of the Government to implement ILO conventions on industrial relations. But we also believe that this should be approached with a degree of caution. We will not oppose the Bill. But we stress as strongly as we can our total disapproval of the Government's agenda of using overseas conventions&mdash;in this case the ILO convention&mdash;to interfere with the free choice of employers and employees to decide how the terms and conditions of their employment are to be governed. It is our view that the external affairs powers were to be used entirely for that reason, not for any internal domestic matters. That matter will be the subject of debate on the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill (No. 2). <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are considering three cognate Bills&mdash;the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992, the Coal Industry Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 and the International Labour Organisation (Compliance with Conventions) Bill 1992&mdash;all of which are essentially administrative in nature and do little to change any thrust or philosophy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Amendment Bill has been in gestation for some time, which has given the Australian Democrats the opportunity to speak with vested interest on behalf of people who represent paint industries and users of chemicals. We have been able to receive their representations and to consider the effect that such a Bill would have on the industry. We have also been able to speak with those people who express concern about the way that we use chemicals within our country, how we dispose of them and how they impinge on our industrial activities, social activities and normal daily business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A growing concern in our community is that chemicals should be used in a responsible manner and that we should not have unnecessary chemicals free in the environment affecting things which they should not affect. We have had time to look at this Bill in light of the concerns that are expressed by a growing number of people. We are satisfied that what is proposed does not add any danger to the amount of chemical effect that is not intended. It seems that a great deal of commonsense applies in this Bill. It proposes to remove some of the undue bureaucracy which is attached to assessing whether chemicals will be a danger to people other than the direct users. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support Senator Parer's suggestion that it is commonsense to accept the research documentation which is provided from overseas rather than to repeat, in an unproductive manner, the doubling up of research on the same chemical which happens in Australia. I also agree with Senator Parer that it seems common sense and would be a good idea to create a kit to help companies identify their obligations under the law. It seems that far too often we add obligations without considering cross-referencing and the relevance that these new obligations might have to existing ones. Senator Parer's suggestions are good, but are not being delivered at the moment, although the proposition does remove some of the previously cumbersome bureaucratese. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this Bill first saw the light of day, we were concerned that an open-ended amnesty, which I think was intended to be transitional, might apply. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee shared that concern. I am pleased to see that the Government has taken that matter into account and addressed it so that it will not deliver an open-ended amnesty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the Coal Industry Legislation Amendment Bill. Senator Parer identified that essentially it embraces an eminently desirable administrative change. But then Senator Parer spent some minutes&mdash;and I will not attempt to use the same amount of time&mdash;addressing the coal industry in its wider perspective. He gave some statistics of which I am sure those who are interested in the Australian industry would be well aware. He said that coal is a major component of Australia's export earnings; that it is the significant industry in that area; and that, even considering that fact, it is still far overwhelmed by the size of the industry in China and the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Parer then took a couple of cheap passing shots at people who had expressed concern at the way in which the use of coal affects the common environment that we share with the rest of the world. I was slighted by Senator Parer's disparagement of people who express concern about the profligate way we use energy. People who express such concern&mdash;and Senator Parer in his insult singled out such people as Senator Coulter and the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories, Mrs Kelly&mdash;were described by Senator Parer as passing stupid remarks. I challenge the suggestion that they are stupid. I suggest that those who express concern about our profligate use of energy are very wise and that their wisdom will be vindicated by the passage of history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The stupid ones are those who do not recognise that coal is a finite resource. It is by definition `finite'&mdash;we cannot create it. What is there will eventually be used. What is there is being used, I would suggest, at an unsustainable pace. Of course, by definition we cannot sustain the use of something that is finite. But to reduce its use, to consider carefully how best to gain the utmost productivity out of each kilogram, is a much wiser way of using that resource than use that is cavalier and pays no regard to the fact that eventually we will run out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A carbon tax has been suggested, but its immediate effect would be to increase the price. The effect of increasing a price is that people will seek to squeeze whatever possible productivity they can out of the resource and that users are keener to exploit a particular resource to its fullest, rather than to allow inefficiencies to creep into its usage. It has been said that any suggestion that we should slow down our use of this resource will affect our export industries. The suggestion may be accurate, but it is a subjective consideration to label such concerns as stupid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that there are many other effects on the bargaining process of our export industries&mdash;not the least of which are the exchange rate, remarks made about the state of our economy and the status of the Government. If we were to ignore all these concerns and quiver in our boots rather than to make any comments about them, then we need not bother coming into this Parliament. This Parliament is a forum at which we should exchange ideas, and we should not be intimidated by the suggestion that we may have an effect on some other industry around Australia. With all that out of the way, the opportunity to oppose this Bill is not there. We agree with what it is proposing to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish quickly to address the International Labour Organisation (Compliance with Conventions) Bill. Of course, this is a perfectly reasonable proposition. The Democrats agree with the Bill whose contents are welcome. It is logical that the identity of foreign crews should be in the hands of individuals rather than that we should adopt the paternalistic idea that the master of the ship should say who the particular individuals are. We should readily comply with the sections in the Navigation Act as to the provision of sufficient water, food and catering within a ship, and we should be anxious about such matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I challenge the comment by Senator Parer that we should be careful in using overseas conventions&mdash;which, in his words, `interfere with the employees' and the employers' free choice'. I remind Senator Parer that the International Labour Organisation is a tripartite organisation. It certainly does not exclude employers, government or labour from the opportunity to participate in its proceedings. In fact, the ILO deserves greater respect than to be written off as just another international show. It is a forum in which all interested parties and individuals are able to be represented. It is wrong to suggest that the ILO interferes with employers' and employees' opportunities to indulge in free choice. </PARA>

Those who are interested in this matter may have taken note of an incident which occurred some months ago when a crew of an international vessel arrived in Hobart. I would only describe the situation of those seafarers as destitute. I was unable to visit the vessel myself and make my own assessment, but I think the photograph on the front page of a newspaper of the crew and the description of the conditions explained the position quite clearly. Crew members had insufficient clothing and food. Certainly their living conditions could not possibly be described as adequate; they were living on a seagoing slum.</PARA></TALK.START>

The seafarers themselves were under an obligation to pay any travel fees that they incurred when the vessel went from one port to another. Such travel fees exceeded the measly wages that they were paid, so these poor souls were enslaved to the ship. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;As the previous two speakers have said, we are debating cognately&mdash;to use the affectation of the Senate&mdash;three Bills: the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992, the Coal Industry Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 and the International Labour Organisation (Compliance with Conventions) Bill 1992.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been said by the previous two speakers, Senator Parer representing the coalition and Senator Bell representing the Australian Democrats, both the coalition and the Democrats support the Bills that the Government has brought forward.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since these Bills are industrial relations Bills, perhaps it should not go unremarked that on a day on which we have had some degree of controversy in this chamber on that subject, we follow it up immediately by all of us jointly supporting legislation on industrial relations in these three areas. That is at least some indication that there is an element of cooperation about basic provisions in this field, although that does not go to the areas of philosophical difference between the major parties on industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the Opposition and the Democrats support the Government on this legislation, it does not require me to say very much at all about the arguments brought forward in debate. This has been an opportunity, as sometimes occurs in this chamber, for the contributors to the debate to use the subject heading of the Bill to talk more widely about their views in that field than about the substance of the Bill. I am not critical of that. It happens on both sides of the chamber, and it happened again today. While it is interesting to hear those views, nothing was put that ought to dissuade this chamber from giving the Bills passage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will foreshadow now that when the Industrial Chemicals Bill and the International Labour Organisation Bill reach the committee stage, I will move to each of those an amendment. That amendment has been referred to by the speakers who have preceded me. It is known and anticipated, and I expect it will be unanimously accepted and carried. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I therefore now turn to a couple of the remarks that have been made. I will start in the middle and out of order, just to make it a little more interesting than otherwise would be the case. I acknowledge that Senator Parer, as an old coal man&mdash;and I am sure he would not mind me sourcing his interests to the industry in which he spent so much of his time&mdash;has had some remarks to make about the coal industry, its importance as the leading export commodity for Australia and Australia's standing as the largest exporter in the world of coal although, of course, not the largest producer of coal. I note his comments about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation that we are enacting is to complement legislation passed by the Fahey Government in New South Wales to manage the Joint Coal Board. There are a lot of things that Senator Parer said with which I have considerable sympathy. They relate to the future of the Coal Industry Tribunal. It is a question, as are many others in this country, where we might agree on where we ought to go but we do disagree on how we should get there, what method of consultation we should use and how we manage change, but I note for the record those remarks. I do not want at this stage to get involved in the argument about the environmental impact of the coal industry. I do not think it is relevant to this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of the Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Bill, one of the comments that was made by Senator Parer, and echoed to some extent by Senator Bell, was the responsibility of Government, upon enacting these changes, to promote them to industries so that industries are aware of their obligations under the law. While it is true that, in any court, ignorance of the law is not a defence, it is a fair point to make that when a government changes the law, it does have a responsibility to make it clear to those who would be affected by that change what the changes are and how their obligations have altered consequently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised that Worksafe Australia, the national occupational health and safety authority, the body responsible under our Government for the propagation of this information, is currently preparing a strategy to promote the new scheme and to ensure that industry is well informed about it. It has prepared a comprehensive handbook which explains to industry what it needs to do to comply with the scheme. I mention that as a point of information because I do think the point both speakers have made is a virtuous one in this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn in conclusion to the third Bill, the International Labour Organisation (Compliance with Conventions) Bill. The purpose of this Bill was explained in the second reading speech. We are, by this legislation, bringing Australian maritime law, by and large, into compliance with international labour standards. The changes are not major&mdash;they are minor changes&mdash;but they correct, if you like, the body of law in Australia so that we conform to the international standard that the ILO has recommended to governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ILO is an agency of the United Nations. It is to labour law what the World Health Organisation is to health standards in the world. It recommends, in the field of labour regulation, what acceptable minimum standards should be. It is for the various governments to decide to accept those recommendations. Australia has a reputation in the world as a country that supports the United Nations and wants the United Nations to be an effective pacifying influence in the world, and to enhance the degree of civilisation and respect for civilised standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for those reasons that we cleave to a recognition of the standards that the United Nations agencies recommend, right across the board, in health and other areas. In this case, the International Labour Organisation recommends for labour law. I might say the process of adopting these conventions has been exhaustive. The conventions themselves are given life by an exhaustive process within the agencies of the ILO itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Bell rightly said, this is a tripartite body. It is a body made up of delegates from all countries that are affiliated with it, which is most in the world, and those delegates are split into three groups: workers' representatives, government representatives and employer representatives. The conventions that the ILO recommends have been endorsed by a combined session of all of the countries represented in that tripartite way. So it represents, if I can put it in these terms, the comprehensive view of all of the interest groups who are involved in industrial relations, be they workers, employers or governments, meeting together from all the countries that are affiliated with the United Nations. Therefore, they carry a particular force. They are not partisan; they are not one group's view as opposed to another group's view; they are the adopted view of all and they carry a particular force. Because we recognise the role of the United Nations, it seems appropriate for us as a country to ensure that we do not fall below those minimum standards. This law that we are enacting now will ensure, in the case of the maritime industry, that that is not the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I say the changes are minor, the pleasing feature of them is that it enables us to conform with the conventions and adopt them. It also provides that there will be regular reviews between the Commonwealth Government and each of the State governments under these conventions in a way in which the States and the Commonwealth can work together in the interests of Australia in international forums of the ILO and in monitoring the effect of those changes. It is for those reasons that I support these Bills and accept the remarks and support of the other speakers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another Bill that is in the wings which will come on for debate later today. It is a Bill of much greater controversy. It is a Bill which relates to changing an existing provision in the Industrial Relations Act which will enable workers under State awards, where those State awards have been frozen and the access to independent arbitration abolished, to then opt for a fast track method of re-establishing their awards as Federal awards rather than State awards. The legislation applies, of course, in the State of Victoria, but it is national legislation which will apply where access to independent arbitration has been abolished by a State government. The head of power in the Constitution under which it will operate is the existing head of power that it operates under now, which is the arbitration power. But that is a debate for another time; that other time will be soon, but it is not now. I commend these Bills, with my foreshadowed amendments, to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA>Let me make six very brief points in relation to the amendment. This is an amendment to clause 8 of the Bill. Clause 8 adds division 4 to the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act 1989, an amnesty for eligible chemicals&mdash;`eligible chemicals' being as defined. The amendment substitutes a new proposed section 20B for that originally proposed. The originally proposed section 20B provided for the amnesty period for eligible chemicals to be prescribed by regulation. But the proposed new section, which is the point of this amendment, provides for a fixed two-year amnesty period. So we would prescribe the amnesty period in legislation rather than by regulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The change reflects agreement within the Government, which has consulted with the industry and with unions. The industry organisations support it, as does the ACTU. The fixed period provides additional certainty and will be supported by a promotion strategy, as I said in my earlier remarks.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It may be that Senator Parer was not in the chamber&mdash;I think in fact he was absent&mdash;when I made a remark about this in reply to the second reading debate. The point I made was that, while of course it is true that ignorance of the law is not a defence in a court of law&mdash;people are supposed to know the law&mdash;the question Senator Parer had raised in his remarks, supported by Senator Bell in his remarks, is that nonetheless when the law is changed there is some sort of obligation, particularly when the change may go unnoticed, on the Government or its agencies to promote the change to those who are affected so they are aware of the change and can comply.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take that as the sense of Senator Parer's question: what are we doing about this? A strategy is being developed by Worksafe Australia, which has also prepared a comprehensive booklet of explanation which it will provide to industry.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should also fairly be said that organisations like the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the peak employer body, which has been involved in talks with the Government about these changes and which supports the amendment I have just moved&mdash;as does Senator Parer&mdash;provide as a service to their members information of this character. While all employers are not members of that body, I would certainly recommend to them that they should join. It is an efficient organisation representing their interests; it will keep them informed on these matters and it will be to their advantage. In any case, the Government will maintain its own publicity program and it will work with the organisation in order to see that all those affected are reached. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Hill moving a motion relating to the conduct of business, namely a motion to postpone Government Business order of the day No. 4 (Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992) till the Government has tabled an explanatory memorandum relating to the Government amendments to be moved to the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Acting Deputy President, you know as a result of earlier debate today the unsatisfactory process that the Government is adopting in relation to the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992. This is legislation upon which the Government is seeking to force today's second reading debate without the proper process being observed. Not only are we being put at a disadvantage by not being permitted the usual courtesy of taking this matter to our party room for decision&mdash;this is the first time in recent history, certainly in the 11 years that I have been here, of which I am aware that a government has acted in such a discourteous way&mdash;but also we are being asked to go on to the second reading of this Bill without an explanatory memorandum being available as to the content of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said in an earlier debate, serious constitutional questions are involved in this debate.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is an integral part of the legislative process. It is unheard of that the Government would seek to require the second reading debate to take place without that explanatory memorandum being on the table&mdash;in other words, without the Senate having the advantage of the Government's advisers' assessment as to the content of the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the explanatory memorandum is particularly important in relation to this Bill because of the constitutional consequences. We are unsure, from reading the amendments that have been given to us but I do not think yet publicly circulated&mdash;that is astonishing in itself&mdash;as to the constitutional basis for the Government's amendment. There is a question as to whether the Government, for example, is relying upon the external affairs power. This legislation seems to move away from the constitutional head that deals with interstate disputes, but we are not told in the documentation before us at the moment on which head it is relying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is important information that should be before the Senate before the commencement of this debate&mdash;not some time later in the day, tomorrow or following a committee hearing. That is an irrelevant consideration. Therefore, I seek to suspend standing orders in order to move a motion that debate be adjourned until the Government observes the proper process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened to the Australian Democrats' spokesman in this area in the earlier debate today. Whilst I was particularly disappointed that the Australian Democrats were not prepared to agree to an adjournment of the second reading that would allow our party room processes to take place, I understood the Democrats' spokesman to nevertheless say that they were of the view that the explanatory memorandum should be available before debate took place on the second reading of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Democrats said that, they are, with respect, stating the correct and proper position. I hope that they will stand by that position and, in responding in this debate, agree that it would be wrong to commence this second reading debate without that explanatory memorandum being available. It is bad enough to expect us to debate an issue when we do not have an opportunity for a proper party room decision upon a piece of legislation. I think it is recognised that the only way that we could do that would be by calling all of our House of Representatives members to Canberra at enormous public cost, which no-one would wish to see expended at the moment in the parlous state of the Australian economy. Be that as it may, that is a debate that we had this morning and the Democrats joined with the Government, as they often do, and they did not see the importance of that issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I trust they will now see the importance of this issue: that before a government expects this chamber to commence the debate on the second reading of legislation the explanatory memorandum is put before the chamber since that, in turn, becomes part of the debate. It may be argued by us in the second reading that the explanatory memorandum is incorrect. That, in turn, becomes important in the subsequent interpretation of legislation that gets passed. I am disappointed that the Government is behaving in the way that it is today and I hope this time the Australian Democrats will stand up for what is right and proper. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is yet another foray by the Opposition to try to delay this chamber dealing with the merit of the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992. We can have every technical obstacle thrown up and dealt with, but this chamber knows full well that the procedures in a second reading debate are not about debating the amendments that there might be but about debating the principle of the legislation and, when we complete that debate, whether the principle is agreed or not agreed; and if it is agreed we then complete that debate and go to the detail of how that principle is expressed. At that time, the explanatory memorandum is appropriate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we now have this technical opposition raised by the Opposition which would occasion a delay of a couple of hours to the Government in introducing this Bill, at which time honourable senators in this chamber could debate merit and principle and decide the issue one way or another in a clean and open way rather than through a technical opposition. I think it is desirable that we get to the debating of merit as soon as we possibly can. I also think it is worth while to consider to what extent we are able to accommodate the Opposition so that we do not get derailed in this debate on merit on technical procedural matters. Therefore, I am of a mind to accept the proposal put by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I do, I want to say one other thing. There is a disinformation element to all the things that get said in this debate. The disinformation element consists of this smokescreen about constitutionality; what head of constitutional power the Government is relying on. In this legislation, there is no doubt that there is only one head of constitutional power upon which we are relying&mdash;the head of constitutional power that this Parliament has always relied on since Federation&mdash;and that is the constitutional provisions enabling us to make laws to prevent and settle industrial disputes that go beyond the borders of more than one State; the arbitration power, as it is colloquially called. That is the only head of constitutional power upon which we are relying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a debate, because the Government has foreshadowed its intention, about relying on the external affairs power to enact minimum labour standards in Australia taken from the conventions of the ILO, the United Nations agency. But we are not bringing that on now. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on Monday in Perth, when dealing with the Heads of Government, decided that there would be a further consultative process which I would chair concerning that approach. So we are not proceeding with those matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we are proceeding with the announced intention of the Government to legislate to enable the existing right of State organisations to refer State awards to the Commonwealth in an appropriate way, if they choose&mdash;and `if they choose' is an important element here. That right exists under the Constitution now. It has not, to my recollection, been challenged as a right, but if it has, it has surely been upheld because successive governments have made laws on this basis. I do not think there is any doubt about the constitutionality of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are proposing to do is expand this right, as I said in an earlier debate, to cases where a State government has abolished the independent access to arbitration in a State. Of course, the Victorian Government has abolished the right of organisations to seek arbitration of a grievance or dispute and settle the dispute. But it will be a national law applying around Australia and will be triggered where a State government has abolished that right in the State. It will enable people affected by those changes in laws to have a choice of what system they want&mdash;the Opposition's or ours. We accept the motion. </PARA>

The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the confidentiality of information supplied to bodies investigating and evaluating the quality of medical services and to provide immunity from civil action for members of investigating bodies. Quality assurance refers to the process of monitoring the improvement of the quality of medical services provided. The main purpose of this Bill is to encourage efficient quality assurance activities by prohibiting the disclosure of information gained as a result of, and the protection from civil liability of people who in good faith engage in, these activities. In other words, it provides statutory confidentiality.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned last night, the coalition supports this Bill. However, there are problems with it. Once I have outlined these problems, I am sure that the Government will seriously consider them. All health bodies that have been contacted support the basic principles of the Bill. But obviously there has been inadequate consultation; otherwise we would not have the problem that has become apparent. For example, the Australian Medical Association was notified of the Bill on 20 October. It was told three days later that the Bill would need to be finalised by 26 or 27 October. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, the Medical Protection Society and the Australian Association of Surgeons were all put in a similar position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quality assurance has been a feature of the medical system almost from time immemorial. It has been formalised in recent times because of the necessity for and recognition of public accountability for the activities that occur in the public hospital system, particularly the teaching hospitals. The Australian Hospitals Association, which represents the public hospitals of Australia, has forwarded a letter which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe that section 106N will have unintended and unwelcome consequences.</PARA>
<PARA>The coalition agrees with this. Clause 106N permits the Minister to authorise the disclosure of quality assurance information for the purposes of law enforcement or a royal commission where that information relates to a serious offence, defined as punishable by imprisonment for more than one year. The coalition acknowledges the intention of this clause but believes that its presence or application would seriously undermine quality assurance activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quality assurance largely relies on the voluntary disclosure of clinical information by doctors. There can be frank disclosure and discussion only where both the committee members and the attending practitioner are assured of the confidentiality of the proceedings. It is regarded more as an educational than a punitive activity in which practitioners are able freely to discuss their actions with peers. There are many other avenues for pursuing sanctions against a doctor&mdash;for example, the hospital credentialling and professional disciplinary tribunals or criminal or civil actions. These forums all have rights of access to normal medical records for pursuing these investigations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give honourable senators an example of what can happen in a clinical practice. A doctor, knowing that clinical notes can be subpoenaed by a court of law and revealed, obviously would not put anything in those clinical notes that may be construed as being of a defamatory nature. A specific example, for the benefit of the departmental officers present, is that if a doctor thinks that a patient is malingering, the doctor does not write that on the notes because those notes may appear in a court of law and the doctor would then have to defend that situation. So the doctor writes something else&mdash;two queries, for example, because that means to the doctor that the patient is malingering. The same thing will occur with quality assurance if clause 106N proceeds. In other words, because clause 106N allows retrospective disclosure and the discretionary power of the Minister, it will not achieve the very laudable objectives that are hoped to be achieved. There will be dissimulation, if you like, by the doctor going before the QAC so that this will not be apparent to any Minister or health insurance commission body investigating it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is being proposed has been enacted in New Zealand. It is interesting to discover that what has occurred there is the very thing that I have pointed out. Experience in New Zealand has shown that, after the first occasion when this power was used, the whole process collapsed as individuals perceived the threat to themselves and declined to participate. That will be the unintended consequence of proceeding with clause 106N as it exists today. The Government has to decide whether it wants something that will work or something that appears to work on the surface. It can easily be got around. Dr Cass, the executive director of the quality assurance network and obviously somebody very experienced in this field, has written to me and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not believe that this discretion can be retained and be effective and not lead to the quality assurance process being ineffective. If the quality assurance process becomes ineffective, then of course the ministerial discretion is also useless. No-one will say anything real if an individual can be identified. This is the problem with quality assurance activities right now without statutory immunity.</PARA>
<PARA>Clause 106N states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If it appears to the Minister that information that became known after the commencement of this Part solely as a result of a declared quality assurance activity relates to conduct, whether the conduct took place before or after that commencement&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is the retrospectivity aspect&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that may have been a serious offence against a law (whether written or unwritten) in force in any State or Territory, the Minister may, by signed writing, authorise the information to be disclosed in a way stated in the instrument of authority for the purposes of law enforcement, a Royal Commission or any other prescribed purpose.</PARA>
<PARA>It is a catch-22 situation. Do honourable senators really think that a doctor will go along to a quality assurance committee, knowing that anything he or she says at that committee can be used against him or her in a criminal or civil action, and volunteer information in the interests of the outcome of the quality assurance committee? Apparently, that is not clearly followed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, put yourself in this situation. In the interests of improving the clinical care of patients, doctors go along to a quality assurance committee and are asked `How did this occur? What are the circumstances in which this incident occurred?' This goes on every day in hospitals where various clinical meetings occur. If the outcome is not what was expected, the clinician goes before his peer group and justifies the action that was taken. If this becomes subject to civil or criminal action, there will not be disclosure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no doubt that the Minister, the Government and the Department are trying to achieve the right objective&mdash;that is, to provide confidentiality. However, if clause 106N is retained in the legislation, that will not be the outcome they achieve. The answer is to modify clause 106N, and submissions have been received on that from the bodies I mentioned previously, including the Medical Protection Society, the Australian Association of Surgeons and the Quality Assurance Network. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The objectives are straightforward, as I mentioned previously. The health care professionals are encouraged, under the protection of the legislation, to discuss openly and fully the care they provide to particular patients, even admitting deficiencies that can be recognised with the wisdom of hindsight. In this way, it is hoped that the quality assurance process can help improve the quality of care, which cannot ever be completely science-based but must always have elements of subjectivity as an art. To this day, medicine is an art as well as a science. Into it comes the objectivity and the input of the individual practitioner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the ministerial discretion remaining in clause 106N, if doctors are treated in the way patients expect to be treated by being fully informed of all the implications of the courses of action to be undertaken&mdash;including treatment, with possible failures, or statutory immunity, with its possible retrospective removal&mdash;how many are likely to participate in quality assurance processes for which statutory immunity has been provided? Would you, Mr Acting Deputy President? You would not put yourself in that position. If, through fear that that circumstance could arise, doctors or any other health care professionals decline to participate&mdash;and they cannot be forced to participate in quality assurance programs&mdash;we are where we will be, and that is nowhere. </PARA>

At present, if there is any suspicion that a misjudgment might have occurred, it would be natural, under the circumstances of this Bill, for people to close ranks and protect others.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The objectives of the Bill are correct. As I said, the coalition supports the objectives of the Bill, but in the committee stage it will move to eliminate the ministerial discretion and modify clause 106N. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Medicare Agreements Bill 1992 has not yet been agreed to by the States. I do not see how it can be called the Medicare Agreements Bill because the States of New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania have not yet agreed to it. So to begin with, the name of the Bill is totally incorrect. If it were called an agreement that the Government intends to force on the States, we could debate a properly named Bill, but at the moment there has been no agreement and therefore I do not believe that we should be debating it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tomorrow the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs will be considering this Bill. It will have before it all the State Ministers who want to come and the private hospitals. The Committee asked the Australian Hospitals Association, which represents the public hospitals, to come, but, whilst it has put in a submission, it will be unable to come on that day. The Committee has also asked consumer organisations to appear, and it has received about 16 submissions. We asked that the second reading debate be postponed until the Senate Committee sat. As I said, there has been no agreement; to debate a Bill upon which no agreement has been reached is ludicrous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basic principles of this Bill have not been agreed upon by Victoria, New South Wales, Tasmania or Western Australia. We all remember that Mr Keith Wilson, the Labor Minister for Health in Western Australia, decided that he was no longer able to support this Government's health policy. He said that he would rather resign, and he put it very succinctly. Upon his resignation, Mr Wilson appealed for the health debate to be depoliticised in the interests of Australia&mdash;not in the interests of the Labor Party, but in the interests of Australia. He lashed the Federal Government and its ideology in a hard hitting speech which criticised both the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Health (Mr Howe). He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no concern for Canberra because it has no concern for WA and under successive governments we have always had a bad deal.</PARA>

<PARA>Is Senator Tate listening? Does it sound familiar?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Government has been more prepared to cater for the middle class socialists on good incomes, who see it as their right to access public hospitals for free.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet they know people on low incomes, including elderly pensioners, must wait for prolonged periods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The middle class socialists know they need never wait because they can afford to procure hospital care in the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not wish to answer for a final outcome that does not make provision for the place of private health insurance and  believe I must leave it to someone else who will feel easier about completing the task.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what Mr Wilson said before he resigned. As the Labor Minister for Health in Western Australia, Mr Wilson was not prepared to oversee a system that had no place in it for private insurance. He is not on his own: the Minister for Health in New South Wales, Mr Ron Phillips, the Minister for Health in Victoria, Marie Tehan, and the Minister for Health in Tasmania all say the same thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has to acknowledge that the public health system cannot cope on its own to look after the needs of Australians and give access to all Australians, no matter what their income is. Let me explain the ideology of this Government. It said, `We believe everyone should have free access to hospitals. It does not matter whether you are a millionaire or not; everyone should have access to the public hospital system'. It then realised that money was going to blow out and that it could not cope, that in our present public hospital system we cannot cope with the enormous number of people who would access public hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had problems as soon as the Labor Government came into power. By 1987 the waiting lists throughout Australia were so long that the Prime Minister of the time, Mr Hawke, said in his election speech that he would allocate $25m in order to overcome the long hospital queues. In 1988-89, the Budget said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second major initiative is an expanded program of hospital funding involving the expenditure of $3,000 million, and an additional $1,100 million in the next five years over and above previous arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This will be devoted to providing more public hospital beds, shortening hospital queues.</PARA>
<PARA>In the 1988-89 Budget, $3,000m was also allocated to do the same thing. The $25m which was allocated in 1987 was eaten up. After the $3,000m had been allocated in 1988-89, hospital queues were still going up. They went up by 47 per cent in Western Australia alone. In this year's Budget, another $50m was allocated for 1992-93, and an additional $20.9m for 1993-94, so that hospitals could put in place better procedures for managing waiting lists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1987 we have had you throwing more money around to try stop your hospital queues. None of it has succeeded because you are very successfully making things so impossible for people to continue their private health insurance that they are giving it up and going into the public hospital system.

It was never going to be increased to more than one per cent, but now it is 1.25 per cent and it will soon be 1.4 per cent.

What has happened to the $25m? What has happened to the $3,000m? What is happening to this additional $50m? The Government has put aside $3m just for public relation services to see how it can cope with the waiting lists. None of the other schemes have worked.

I agree with Senator Walters that Senator Tate is a very intelligent man, because quite some time ago he acknowledged that he had private health insurance. There is nothing secret about that. I am not trying to pry into his private life; he acknowledged that and I think he is very sensible in doing so. I would hate to think that a member of my family was one of the 60 people who have died in recent times because of not being able to get access to hospital care. </PARA>

All the States want to do is come to an agreement whereby their concerns are resolved. Why will the Government not allow those concerns to be resolved? Why is it ramming this thing through when there is no pressure to do so and there is no need to sign it until 30 June 1993? It is of great concern to us. We cannot deny that there is still a need to resolve the Commonwealth and State roles and responsibilities. The States are very keen to work with the Commonwealth in a climate of cooperation in seeking to negotiate the Medicare agreement. Unfortunately, the Commonwealth approach has had elements of coercion for the States, although the States have indicated a genuine willingness to work cooperatively with the Commonwealth as equal partners. </PARA>

One of the Labor Ministers has reinforced that view: it was such a high concern for him that he actually resigned his portfolio. It is a very tragic situation when the Government not only will not listen to us and the Liberal State Ministers but also will not listen to its own Labor State Ministers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On this occasion, I wish to take some of the Senate's time to draw attention to some problems relating to sales tax registration, and the confusion that will arise as a result of the new, so-called streamlined, sales tax which is to operate from 1 January. Senators may recall that, on 26 November, I raised some problems with the sales tax registrations and exemption certificates, particularly with regard to the start-up date of the new, streamlined sales tax. I now raise a further, related issue of unclear classifications within the system as it relates particularly to the automotive spare parts industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that these sorts of problems typify the difficulties of many other industries. Perhaps the points that I am making will become a lot clearer if I draw attention to some particular problems in that industry. When is an accessory a good or material? Let me give an example. We have a business with a service station and body works combined, and it quotes for a repair on a customer's vehicle which has been damaged in its front suspension and other parts. The front suspension parts would be replaced and would, under the new law, be taxed at the lower rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also in the quote could be repairs for the replacement of the driving lights which, in addition to the suspension, were damaged in the accident&mdash;which would not be surprising. The lights were fitted to the vehicle when new and, as such, are part of the original car. This now means that what is classified as an accessory, in the accepted sense of the word, now becomes a replacement part. Should it therefore be taxed under the new scale, or under the old? On page 2 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Streamlined sales tax and how it affects you</EMPHASIS>, under the heading `What is a wholesale sale?', example No. 4 reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sales of goods or materials to a repairer who uses those goods in repair work.</PARA>
<PARA>At first reading, this would appear to mean that the product can be used to replace the damaged or worn parts of the job in question. But, if people read it again, it could mean if new tools also were supplied to be used on the job. Does this really mean that tools are sold, but not as wholesale sales&mdash;particularly if the vehicle is not a luxury vehicle?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give a few more examples. When does a repair cease being a repair and become maintenance&mdash;for example, when an oil filter is replaced during an engine rebuild? Is a stop additive with antifreeze a repair or a service? Is such a simple thing as replacing a faulty grease nipple a repair, but if it substitutes for a plastic bung inserted during manufacture not a repair? If a damaged quartz halogen globe is replaced by one of stronger wattage than the original, is it a repair or is it maintenance? When is an accessory a hard spare? They are just some of the difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me go now to the problem of page 2 of this document about streamlined sales tax. In that section, we read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The following examples are types of sales which are NOT wholesale sales under the new law.</PARA>
<PARA>So the problem is one of whether these sales are retail or wholesale. This is the difficulty that one runs into. No. 4 in the list reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sales of Goods or Materials to a repairer or panel beater who uses those goods in repair work.</PARA>
<PARA>We then go to the explanatory note. The current sales tax law makes all goods and materials taxable in this area at 20 per cent, subject to a few exemptions regarding primary and mining conditions, and the tax can be charged at the normal place of selling&mdash;that is, at the second last point of sale. The new law means that, as it is not a wholesale sale, it must be a retail sale, which means that sales tax is charged at the wholesaler's cost price or buying-in price, and not at the retailer's buying-in price. This would occur in a whole lot of cases. I now put to the Senate seven different situations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, millions of dollars of sales tax revenue could be lost to the Government as the tax would be collected at an earlier stage, that is, prior to the wholesaler's freight into store costs. I have raised this issue previously with the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, all computers would have program alterations and invoice books would be reprinted to handle retail sales without sales tax being identified on the same invoice as the normal wholesaler's invoice. If the amount of sales tax collected was shown, it would mean another column would be required on an invoice to identify the 20 per cent tax on the wholesaler's buying-in price, as it obviously would be less than the required amount on the selling price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, there would be great resistance by wholesalers to identify the amount of sales tax involved. The competitor in the same trade, for example, would be able to calculate from the amount of tax involved how much the wholesaler had paid for his goods and how much profit margin he had on the goods at the time of sale. Fourthly, there is the difficulty for a wholesaler in identifying whether a product should be charged at the wholesaler's buying-in price plus 20 per cent or whether the normal method of taxing should be used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fifthly, there is the difficulty for retailers when identifying products on their shelves of knowing which tier of sales tax has been charged, for example, if there is a service station with an auto parts and accessory shop attached. Sixthly, there is the impossibility of policing such a situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, there is the impossibility of determining when an accessory&mdash;which is going to be taxed at the reseller's buy-in price from the new ruling&mdash;is not an accessory but a repair, and I have given those examples. These particular classes of taxpayer are not accountants; they are manual workers all around Australia and they are going to have great difficulty with this so-called new streamlined sales tax. The interesting point is that a number of taxpayers have contacted their local sales tax divisions and cannot get answers to the sorts of queries that I have raised, yet the system is going to operate from 1 January. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government has inflicted upon the taxpayers of this country an insidious and unworkable sales tax. It is a sales tax first mooted as the simplification package, and I note the word `simplification' is no longer used. In fact, all the literature from the Australian Taxation Office is now calling these sorts of changes the streamlined sales tax. Considering the sorts of issues that I have just discussed, a lot of businesses are going to be in trouble with this so-called new streamlined sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's inadequacies with regard to this legislation are going to cost Australian taxpayers dearly in terms of the taxes. Also, when they become subject to audit there are going to be all sorts of problems. Consider the simple example that I have just given of a service station which has a repair shop attached to it. How will the everyday taxpayer know he can claim an exemption if the Taxation Office does not advertise and is not able to give him specific advice? Who will pay for this? Obviously, in the end it will be the Australian taxpayer. Not only will further advertising be required, but that advertising should be taking place now through a direct mail-out to the 56,000 retailers and 135,000 sales tax registrants who have already been advised of a 1 January start up and who are not yet aware whether they can use an exemption declaration or whether they can continue using exemption certificates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe this whole sales tax fiasco which has been created by this Government is a sterling case for the introduction of the coalition's goods and services tax. Along with the removal of the sales tax and all those other taxes that the John Hewson coalition has mentioned, the GST will place the burden of tax where it belongs and will reduce administrative problems and burdens and eliminate confusion. I ask Senator Button to address the issues, particularly in relation to all those poor people in the automotive trades who are going to be subject to such difficulty in interpreting whether they are wholesale or retail sales. Can Senator Button help?</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Gareth,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 24 September 1992, you incorporated into the Hansard of Senate Estimates Committee B a letter you wrote to me concerning population policy and human rights, with specific reference to China.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I then offered to provide a detailed response and you expressed the view that it would be particularly helpful if my response, also, was to be incorporated into Hansard at a future date, and supporting documentation were to be tabled and made available.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, I am forwarding this letter to you together with documentation. The former I will seek to have incorporated into today's Senate Hansard, and the latter I will table.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You will recall that for a number of years I have raised, and sought to have answered by you and your Department, serious questions relating to Australia's commitment to human rights and its bizarre support, tangible or moral, for population control programs which, to the impartial observer, inherently violate these rights.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As far back as October 1987, when I questioned an AIDAB statement that the "United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) had let a $500,000 project related to its program in China to the Demography Department of the Australian National University", your Department stated that it was "confident that none of the UNFPA activities with which Australia is involved would in any way assist the implementation of coercive population policies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subsequent exchanges have made it clear that such an expression of confidence was never grounded in reality.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is regrettable that you and your Department have remained firmly pegged to assertions such as this. This is despite the fact that UNFPA has</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*coordinated international support&mdash;and applause&mdash;for China's "successful, yet brutal population control program;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*assisted IUD production for eventual use in enforcing compulsory IUD policies in China;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*supported, at the height of coercion in 1983, the awarding of the UN Population Award to the head of China's Family Planning Commission;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*enthusiastically embraced a program it has described as "totally voluntary", a pathetic claim which, to your credit, you have finally rejected in your letter to me of 7 September 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indeed, your September 1992 letter, although repeating some claims contradicted by up-to-date evidence I have provided, does indicate a willingness of behalf of yourself and AIDAB to come to terms with at least some of the issues I have been raising over a period of five years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The process has been excruciatingly slow.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In October 1988, AIDAB told Senate Estimates Committee B that it "is satisfied that UNFPA operates entirely within the frameworks that are acceptable to the government where it is working." In December of the same year, I referred in the Senate to evidence of violations of human rights and urged the government to "have a good look at this question." Senator Cook responded on the Government's behalf that he thought that "it was for individual countries to decide what they should do about their own family planning programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In September 1989, in response to a question from me, you told the Senate that "the population control program that is conducted in China&mdash;although it has been the subject of allegations made by Senator Harradine and his ilk over the years&mdash;has never been one about which I have seen evidence to justify the allegations that are being made about coercive abortion, involuntary sterilisation and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AIDAB meanwhile had been writing to concerned members of the public claiming that "the Chinese Government itself has stated that coercive population activities are illegal in China", <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">despite the fact that it was forced to admit in September 1989 that it had produced written evidence of the documented evidence of coercion in China which I had provided.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indeed, it has taken some time for yourself and the Department to come to terms with the issue of coercion. In September 1989, an AIDAB officer told Senate Estimates Committee B that the appropriateness of means used to implement a population control program is "a matter for political and foreign policy judgement" and that "AIDAB is not in a position to comment on these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When I presented AIDAB with a case&mdash;commended by UNFPA&mdash;involving punishment for their villages if Indonesian women refused to have inserted an intrauterine device, AIDAB claimed that its officers would hold "a range of views", and admitted that "there is no consolidated AIDAB view" on whether this case involved coercion or not.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a written response to me, AIDAB indicated that Australia interprets `coercion' in the context of population programs to mean "the use or threat of force". In Estimates, an AIDAB officer added that "it seems to me that that is not really a question which a development assistance agency, as such, is qualified to interpret." You later expressed concern that this response was incomplete, adding that "coercion can take many forms other than the physical exercise of force." Another AIDAB official added that "AIDAB recognises that there can be occasions when financial or other threats can have a coercive effect", <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">but she confirmed the case by case approach</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the light of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs Defence and Trade's recent rejection of this concept of "cultural relativism, and its strong endorsement of the universal notion of human rights, it is to be hoped that AIDAB has now jettisoned this case by case procedure. [A Review of Australia's Efforts to Promote and Protect Human Rights, JCFADT, December 1992, p.5]</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1990, AIDAB's Appraisals, Evaluation, and Sectoral Studies Branch issued a brief on Population claiming that "population and family planning programs do work, adding that "without them there would be closer to 200 million more people in China and India today." On its own admission, AIDAB had a limited understanding at the time of the methods being used in China to enforce population control. Of course, the proponents of population control have rarely looked beyond the "if it works, endorse it" mentality.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This rare and candid admission of the effectiveness of coercion contradicts the more recent diversionary statements of such people as UNFPA's Executive-Director Nafis Sadik, who stated at the National Press Club in Canberra in August this year that actual or moral coercion is "unsuccessful from a practical point of view" and that "there is no such thing as `population control' ".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In February 1990, you wrote to me claiming that "no link has been established between UNFPA and coercive population activities in China, adding that "for many years the Chinese Government has consistently asserted that it is firmly opposed to coercive population activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have always wondered, in lighter moments, whether your Government responded to critics of the Tiananmen Square massacre in June 1989 by informing them that "the Chinese Government has asserted that nothing happened.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Population policy base</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In February 1990 you provided me with a copy of Australia's Policy Base for Population-Related Aid Activities. This statement included "a recognition of the right of the individuals to choose the number of children they have", but then denied this right by adding the nullifying rider of "the need to balance this right against the interest of society in maintaining population growth within manageable levels". The statement noted that Australia would avoid support for "programs using coercive element, but added the curious statement declaring Australia's "recognition of the right of individual governments to determine their own policies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was disturbed to discover that the new Policy on Support for Population Activities you issued in November 1990 deleted in the Policy Base all reference to the rights of couples to make the responsible decision as to family size. Replacing it was a "recognition that the number of children individuals choose to have now . . . is a legitimate concern for society as a whole", and a statement that the new policy is based on "the avoidance of support for coercive contraception programs while recognising the right of individual governments to determine their own policies in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most Australians would be astonished to learn, as indeed I was, that the Australian government does not support a universal, inherent right of individuals to determine family size free from government dictates. Many observers of population control organisations would be aware, of course, that the protestations of "reproductive freedom and choices" have been mere public relations slogans.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This new Policy also stated that "the goal of Australia's population policy is to support the development of effective population strategies and programs aimed at urgently slowing and eventually reversing population growth . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Chinese provincial regulations</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In September 1990 I raised at Senate Estimates the Shanghai birth control regulations which came into effect on 1 August 1990, and asked you whether you would characterise a violation of workers' rights as a fine on work units if they exceed their quota of births or a fine on the individual worker. You responded that "if there is any question of punitive sanctions being applied, that is not something that we would regard as an appropriate way of applying those policies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After raising questions at this time on the possible use of Australian-funded ultrasound machines in enforcing compulsory IUD use in China, you asked me for evidence on possible violations of human rights in China's population control program. I pointed out that I provided such evidence to AIDAB at Estimates Committee hearings in 1989. AIDAB will also recall that I provided it in October 1990, upon request, with copies of documents detailing human rights abuses associated with China's population control program. The documents included a translation of current birth control regulations in Sichuan province.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In October 1990, AIDAB responded to a question I had asked in Estimates regarding the new Shanghai birth control regulations by providing me with limited information on new birth control regulations in Henan province. The response indicated that the Government would "consider raising the issue with the Chinese authorities if there was evidence that the Henan regulations were being enforced in a coercive and punitive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No doubt AIDAB has since discovered that Article 24 of these new regulations for Henan state that "a woman of childbearing age who has had one child must use an IUD. If a couple of childbearing age have had two or more children, either the husband or the wife must be sterilised. . . . In case a woman becomes pregnant without permission under the state plan, remedial measures must be taken to terminate the pregnancy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In November 1990 I asked you in the Senate why I had been supplied with information on Henan when I had specifically asked about the new regulations in Shanghai where Australian-funded ultrasound machines were being sent for use by the State Family Planning Commission. You indicated that you were "as puzzled as Senator Harradine is", and promised a "considered review" of the Shanghai program. You added that you "certainly do not think that [family planning programs] should be conducted on a coercive basis and in a way that interferes with other rights of the people in question." You indicated that you "propose[d] writing to Senator Harradine in some detail reviewing this material when I and my Department and AIDAB are in a position to formulate a full and considered response which is what he has now sought for a long time and what I think is owing to him.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 12 November 1990 I welcomed the promised analysis and added that "it is quite obvious that the Department has not had the material on which to make a proper assessment as to whether these [ultrasound] machines will be used for coercive purposes." I noted that "the sort of pressure that is being placed on the women, in particular, in China is something which we should not be associated with. I feel it is high time that the sorts of statements that have been emanating from the Minister&mdash;presumably written by AIDAB&mdash;have to be closely examined because they do not stand up to the light of day.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 29 November 1990 I referred to a US Senate motion on Tibet which condemned the "coercive population policies, including the use of forced abortion and forced sterilisation, and I asked you whether you were "aware of evidence from Tibet that these brutal policies are being inflicted by the PRC on women in that country." You responded that you were "concerned that Senator Harradine should have a properly considered reply to these matters, with as much data as we can compile" and that this response will be provided "as soon as possible".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In December 1990 you wrote to me providing the response by AIDAB to the evidence of coercion in China which I had supplied. The letter made the surprising claim that "the most authoritative available statement on the present nature of China's population policies" is an April 1990 statement of the Minister-in-Charge of the State Family Planning Commission of China which states that "in no case is coercion allowed as a means of implementing family planning policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The letter stated that "it is our clear understanding that there is no policy of forced abortion or sterilisation in China, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">including in Tibet</EMPHASIS>" [emphasis added], and added that "there is no evidence of which we are aware that IUDs are imposed on women by forceful means". This, despite the fact that documentation I had provided actually detailed such evidence. You conceded that "the imposition of any fines of a magnitude causing genuine hardship, while perhaps not in the same category as physical coercion, does constitute unacceptable coercion and as such could not be supported by the Australian Government." You also indicated that you would make these views known to PRC officials, and would write to the Executive Director of UNFPA advising her of the Australian Government's position, and "urging her to exert her organisation's influence to encourage the termination of such unacceptable practices.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In December 1990 I congratulated you in the Senate on finally acknowledging that the imposition of fines by PRC officials for so-called unauthorised pregnancies constituted "unacceptable coercion." However, I called the response "shallow in the face of overwhelming evidence to what are widely held and profound concerns for the human rights of families, and particularly of the poor and powerless women who bear the brunt of state-sponsored population control violence." I said that to conclude that "there is no evidence that lUDs are imposed upon women by forceful means" indicated that the documented material provided by me "has not been studied" by AIDAB.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I doubted whether "the victims of such oppression will find comfort" in your promise to ask Dr Sadik, Executive-Director of UNFPA to exert her organisation's influence to encourage the termination of such unacceptable practices. I pointed out that Dr Sadik had told a Washington audience in 1989 that the Chinese Government was running a totally voluntary program. I said that "little attention has been paid to this subject for many years, and it is understandable that AIDAB finds itself surrounded by the alluring and sanitised pronouncements of foreign governments, and the shallow responses of organisations&mdash;international and local&mdash;with vested interests in population control." I urged AIDAB to "once again examine the material I have provided" and suggested that Dr John S Aird's 1990 book on Coercive Birth Control in China "should be priority reading.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In May 1991, AIDAB tabled an undated letter in Estimates to me in response to my comments in the Senate on 20 December 1990. Regrettably, the letter stated that AIDAB had only conducted "a preliminary evaluation" of Dr Aird's detailed expose of coercion in China, and even then only "by means of a review of the relevant academic literature on the question of coercion in China's family planning program." I would have preferred that AIDAB read the book thoroughly and evaluated the facts presented therein. Not surprisingly, therefore, the letter claimed that the "prevailing view" is that "the PRCs family planning program is not based on coercion." The letter also rejected the allegation that UNFPA's support for China's population control program helps to legitimise the means used by the PRC in its family planning program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At Estimates in May 1991, AIDAB also tabled a response from Dr Sadik dated 25 March 1991 to a letter from Dr Blewett, Minister for Overseas Trade and Development. Dr Sadik stated that she is "familiar with Senator Brian Harradine's concerns with respect to the Chinese Government's population policies", but that "as you know, the Government has assured us that the policy is a voluntary one.. with a great number of exceptions to the one child policy." Dr Sadik indicated that she would be in China during the first half of April and "certainly will bring up the concerns which you have raised with the highest authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I later noted in the Senate that to the best of my knowledge, "Dr Sadik has . . . never come out and criticised the coercive elements of the Chinese population control program." I pointed out that when Dr Sadik actually visited the PRC in April 1991 she was quoted on 8 April by the Xinhua General Overseas News Service as saying that "China should feel very proud of its achievements in effectively controlling the growth of its population.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I also questioned AlDAB's enthusiasm for population control in Vietnam given that a Reuters report had reported a government decree that "for those who have too many children the organs of direct management will mete out appropriate punitive measures.." You responded that you "share [my] distaste for anything in-the nature of coercion associated with these population programs in China, Vietnam or anywhere else." You added that "we will further pursue some of those issues in relation to China in the course of the human rights delegation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Human Rights Delegation to China</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In October 1991 I raised in the Senate the issue of the advice regarding PRC population policy and practice provided to the Australian Human Rights Delegation prior to its visit to China in September 1991. I noted that the advice was provided not by the Human Rights Branch of Foreign Affairs, but by AIDAB "which has a vested interest in this particular area." I noted that preparation of the advice was contracted out to a "vigorous protagonist of UNFPA and of population control programs". In response, you claimed that it was "physically impossible" for the Human Rights Branch "to do directly and personally the kind of detailed research that this and related issues demand" and that AIDAB itself does not have "the kind of in-house resources available to undertake this research in the necessary detail.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In December 1991, I noted in the Senate that the report of the Human Rights Delegation to China claimed that it was assured that abortion is never mandatory in Sichuan province, and I asked why the delegation was not informed prior to going to China of the actual Sichuan province regulations which state that abortion is compulsory in certain circumstances. I cited specific regulations, and asked who was responsible for the delegation being "so poorly briefed in respect of these gross violations of human rights in China." You responded that you will seek further information.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 10 December you tabled your response in the Senate. You dismissed suggestions that the delegation was not fully briefed prior to visiting China, and claimed that advice you had received on the interpretation of Sichuan Province Family Planning Regulations rejected that they necessarily imply compulsory abortion and sterilisation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 27 December 1991 Dr Sadik of UNFPA wrote to AIDAB regarding UNFPA assistance to China. She made the ludicrous claim that "coercion has occurred when poorly trained grassroots family planning workers, some only marginally literate, relied on slogans and quotas that they seldom fully understood." Regrettably, AIDAB claimed in a letter in July this year that it was "satisfied" with this pitiful response from UNFPA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In December 1991, AIDAB published Dr Hull's paper entitled `Recent Population Policy in China'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In March 1992, I moved in the Senate that the report of the Australian Human Rights Delegation to China be referred to a Senate committee to examine why it was not briefed properly on China's population control program prior to departure, and why it failed to make reference to provisions in Sichuan which legally entrench violations of human rights. The move failed 34-31. The Government spokesperson~ Senator Maguire, used the odd excuse that the Government would reject the motion because the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, of which he is chairman, already had too much work to do.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Muzzling the critics</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In March 1992, I was surprised to receive a letter from new Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, John Kerin, in which he wrote that he was "concerned to be informed that the extent of [my] involvement, through both Questions on Notice and Estimates Committee hearings, is demanding an extraordinary amount of time and energy from a wide range of AIDAB staff', suggesting that "there is a limit to the resources it should invest to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Naturally, fundamental issues of human rights must be relentlessly pursued irrespective of attempts to muzzle or brand people who raise such concerns. Mr Kerin's letter is particularly surprising in light of his Ministerial Policy Paper issued in November this year. In this document, entitled `Changing Aid for a Changing World', one reads that "the Minister has asked AIDAB to seek maximum community involvement to review development issues in the area of population. . . " [emphasis added]. It would be a great tragedy if attempts were made by idealogues to censor out certain views&mdash;and documented evidence&mdash;from this review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In March 1992 you wrote to me reaffirming your confidence in the advice provided to the delegation by Dr Hull, and asserted that Dr Hull's report for AIDAB was "a balanced and objective study." You also rejected a suggestion that AIDAB should publish a response to Dr Hull's report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In May 1992 I referred in the Senate to 1990 census figures for China "which show that for every 100 boys under two years of age there were only 89 girls", and asked you to "concede that the missing female millions were victims of the PRCs one child per family population control program". I also asked "why and on whose advice AIDAB currently has a delegation in China for the purposes of increasing Australian aid, directly or though UNFPA, for that barbaric program." You responded "that it is very much Senator Harradine's judgement that the Chinese population program is barbaric. Other judgements differ, including the judgements of the human rights delegation..</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At this stage, I tabled a fully-documented, detailed response to Dr Hull by China scholar Dr John S Aird entitled `Foreign Assistance to Coercive Family Planning in China'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In June 1992 you tabled in the Senate an AIDAB response to my question regarding an Australian family planning mission to China. The response alleged, without proof, that "clearly, if UNFPA programs were withdrawn or if Australia decided not to assist, the situation of the Chinese people would not be any better than it is", and added that "we will not be deterred from considering such assistance by the one-sided arguments of Senator Harradine.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Naturally, the gratuitous "one-sided arguments" comment required no response from me, reflecting, as it did, on the professionalism of the AIDAB officer who prepared your brief.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In August 1992, Reuters reported that family planning officials in China were urging "greater vigilance in enforcing strict population control policies", and cited comments by State Family Planning Commission Director Peng Peiyun that China "could not afford the slightest bit of relaxation or optimism" in its population control efforts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Admitting Coercion</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 7 September 1992 you wrote to me detailing your and AIDAB's response to Dr Aird's report tabled in the Senate on 27 May.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After five years, you and your Department finally conceded that China operates a "compulsory family planning policy [which] has held down the number of children to fewer than most couples want." You noted that it is "important to acknowledge that the required nature of the birth limitation policy which the Chinese government has adopted to tackle the population problem has many deleterious consequences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your letter noted that "most commentators agree that if the state's requirement to limit and plan births to specified levels were lifted, many couples would not restrict themselves to one or two children as currently required." You also acknowledged that "the introduction of the [one-child] policy . . . also has resulted in significant increases in the ratio of abortions to live births in China. Abortion is the only method by which women, once pregnant, can prevent births inconsistent with policies or contracts and remain within the terms of the law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This, of course, contradicts the assertions which UNFPA and Chinese officials have been making for many years, and which have been merely repeated by AIDAB and which were repeated in the report of the Human Rights Delegation which visited China in 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your letter noted that the focus of the program is on "meeting birth targets" which results in an emphasis on `low-cost, poor quality IUDs and sterilisations&mdash;which are controlled by service providers rather than by users themselves." Your letter noted the role of UNFPA in "supporting the production and expanded use of high-quality, modern IUDs in China." Indeed, it is most important that UNFPA's continuing contribution to the control exercised by "service providers" be exposed, although I rather suspect that this is not the interpretation you intended.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The letter referred to the new Administrative Procedural Law purportedly "intended to give citizens some recourse in law against abuses by officials." This, of course, is the latest diversionary line being adopted by UNFPA, and by Dr Hull in his paper. The evidence cited by Dr Hull, in fact, reasonably leads to the opposite conclusion that the new APL is designed not to curb the powers of family planning cadres, but to strengthen them and make sure that the rules are enforced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nevertheless, I welcome AIDAB's and your conversion from the stance that there is no evidence of coercive practices condoned by the Chinese authorities in its population control program, to now admitting that the program is inherently coercive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Had I accepted the original responses, or even bowed to pressure from people such as Mr Kerin, none of this would have become open to public scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Constructive Involvement?</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The evidence of human rights violations continues to lead me to the view that there can not be constructive involvement with regimes pursuing population control where such involvement will be interpreted and used, both domestically and internationally, as endorsement of the regime's population control policies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As Dr Aird has written:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">"Improving the quality of services, even in family planning programs, is certainly, possible and may be beneficial to some people in China, but the advantages of doing that must be weighed against the disadvantages that result from lending support to a coercive program and thereby helping to perpetuate its inhumanities. . . .</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The choice is between the unrealistic hope of `helping in a very small way' by supporting the Chinese family planning program on the one hand and, on the other, sending a strong message to the top political leadership by refusing cooperation until coercion is effectively terminated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The victims of population control mania&mdash;who are almost invariably poor and powerless women&mdash;deserve to have the world hear the truth. As we have discovered over these past five years, strong vested interests have impeded this search for truth which must, of necessity, be ongoing.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. It is important, and I believe it would be instructive for AIDAB and other agencies, including the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, to study this document and the response I have made. If Australia continues with its policies, then it is my view that we should hang our heads in shame. When democracy ultimately comes to the people of China they will remember the suffering in that area which has been condoned by Australia and its aid agencies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter I want to raise on this Human Rights Day is also, I believe, a serious reflection on the treatment of the human rights of individuals by Australia. This Senate has prided itself on its responsibility and its role to uphold the rights of individuals. I am proud to have been amongst those senators who vigorously opposed the legislation the Government rushed through the Parliament, in May of this year, to prevent certain Cambodian refugees and boat people from approaching the Federal Court to obtain release from detention pending the outcome of their refugee status claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had an opportunity to look at the High Court decision of Tuesday, 8 December, which ruled invalid that part of the legislation which was passed by this Parliament in May. I add that that legislation was passed against my wishes and against the wishes of a number of other honourable senators. I will quote some sections from that judgment which I believe the Government will find most interesting and which will have quite dramatic ramifications for the Government. On page 16, their honours said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In particular, it has not been suggested on behalf of the Minister or the Commonwealth that any of the plaintiffs was arrested pursuant to the old s.38 . . . or the subsequent s.92 . . . of the Act or that any order of detention of any of the plaintiffs in custody was ever made under either of those sections. The result is that the continued detention of each plaintiff in custody after the destruction of the boat on which he or she arrived in Australia was unlawful.</PARA>
<PARA>The High Court justices said that those people had been kept in detention unlawfully&mdash;some of them for over two years. Prior to that comment, on page 13, their honours had said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nor, in the absence of legislative provision to the contrary, does an alien within the country lack standing or capacity to invoke the intervention of a domestic court of competent jurisdiction if he or she is unlawfully detained.</PARA>
<PARA>The following comment is something that the Government should consider:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the unlawful detention is by a person who is an officer of the Commonwealth, the status of that person as such an officer will of itself neither confer immunity from proceedings against him or her personally in the ordinary courts of the land nor provide an answer to an application for <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">habeas corpus</EMPHASIS> in any court of competent jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA>If I were the president of the union responsible for the industrial interests of those Commonwealth officers who were instructed to hold those Cambodian boat people in detention and who are now exposed to court action, I would certainly be asking the Government to take the necessary steps to settle the matter with honour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Cambodian boat people have been denied their fundamental human rights by the Government. The Court has said so. They have been incarcerated unlawfully for over two years. The Court has said so. The Court has now said that those people have standing to approach courts for remedies and that the officers who have detained them are personally liable. That raises very serious questions for the Government to properly address. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the opportunity today to refer to three matters, and I shall do so briefly. The first arises from a question I asked the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) on 3 December. He replied and incorporated his answer in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> on 8 December, which meant I had not seen it when I asked the question and could not take note of it at the time. It related to the question of a calculation of superannuation guarantee payment on the termination of employment of components of holiday pay, long service leave and some sick leave. In answering, the Minister indicated that superannuation guarantee is paid on those items and so they would be in the normal course of employment. But the significance of my question was in the words `upon the termination of employment' and that part of the question has not been answered or dealt with in the answer which the Minister has incorporated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The significance of the words `upon the termination of employment' is that if an employer has somebody who leaves on Friday he pays these additional amounts upon termination. I see no reason why they should attract superannuation guarantee. It seems to me that that is something that would be paid on a person's wage, on his holiday wage&mdash;while he is away from work on holidays&mdash;or when he is sick. But to pay it on those amounts which have accrued at the time of termination means that the employer is paying twice. If someone leaves work on Friday, and another person starts on Monday, the employer is liable to pay the superannuation guarantee levy from the Monday. I would like Senator Button to take the matter back to Treasury and ask it to focus upon the phrase `upon the termination of employment' in answering the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part of the question asked how much additional revenue would be raised if the interim ruling required an employer to pay on those items which are calculated as part of the termination pay. It indicates further that the question was not understood when Senator Button said, `I am advised that there will be no additional revenue as a result of the ruling'. That clearly is not the case; there is additional revenue as a consequence if the ruling of the Treasury is interpreted in the way that it seems to be, in regard to the words `upon the termination of employment'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week we heard, I think through an announcement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), that all primary school children would be learning an Asian language by the year 2000. I do not argue with that as an approach. I ask the Prime Minister what he is going to do about those who are graduating in 1992 with Asian languages&mdash;who are fluent in the language and are competent to go to work and use the language&mdash;who cannot get a job anywhere. I could give a number of examples, but in particular I know of a student in Canberra who has an economics degree, an Asian studies degree and a major&mdash;perhaps honours&mdash;in Mandarin. He is fluent in Mandarin and he has applied everywhere for a job which would use this language. He is not the only one I know of with Chinese. I know of people with Japanese language skills who would want to use them in the area of trade in the places they are talking about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In one newspaper referred to, Mr Goss said that the fact that few prominent Australian businessmen and women speak any Asian languages is unfortunate and places major constraints on the development of trade and investment opportunities. Dr Lawrence referred to this as being important to improve cultural and trading links with Asia. She said that she believed that it is absolutely essential, if Australia is to be serious about its future with Asia. That phrase might have been from Mr Goss. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are students here and now in whom this country has invested thousands of dollars in learning languages and who are now fluent who cannot&mdash;in 1992, at the end of this academic year&mdash;get jobs. I know one who is employed parking cars. Of course, that job ought to be available to somebody who does not speak fluent Mandarin and whose skill would be parking cars. But the job is being filled at present by a young man who has fluent Mandarin, who cannot get into the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, AIDAB or any of the places in Canberra or anywhere else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To come out and say that by the year 2000 everybody will speak an Asian language is commendable but what about jobs for those people? What is really being done to provide jobs or opportunities for people who already have these skills and are not able to use them? It seems to me that the announcement last week was pretty meaningless. It was designed to make the Government look as though it was doing something rather than actually doing something, because we know that at the present time there are people who are highly qualified who are not able to use their skills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come to the third matter, which is again to do with people with skills. I was intrigued by the answer that the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) gave earlier this week to a question asked by Senator Sherry. The question was clearly designed to enable the Minister to make a ministerial statement on the Disability Services Act. Senator Bolkus said that the achievements of the Government in this area had met `all the needs' of people with disability. I wrote down his words. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to tell him that that is not the case and I want to refer specifically to the group in Canberra called Chartwell Crafts. All honourable senators present would be aware of the work done by these young artists because their tapestries are hanging in a number of places in this building and in other places. For some reason, it has been determined that the Disability Services Act definition does not apply to them. Last year they were given some money but they have been told constantly that the Disability Services Act does not apply to them because the art they are pursuing is not work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Madam Acting Deputy President, I wonder what would happen if you or I or any other senator told the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, the Australian Ballet or the Australian Opera, bodies that are heavily funded by taxpayers in this country, that what they are doing is not work. Yet these young artists are told that, under the Disability Services Act, what they do is not work. They will be assisted to get jobs. I ask: where are the jobs that these young people with disabilities may be able to do? It has been suggested that some of them may be able to do photocopying or they may be able to get a job detailing a car. They might be able to do those jobs if they were able to get them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder what is the real thrust of the Disability Services Act. One of the documents, a summary of amendments to the Disability Services Act, said that it would allow the Minister to fund on a case by case basis. That does not seem to be happening in relation to these young artists. They have been taught their skill all through their time at school, at the Woden School, at Woden Valley High School and at Dickson College. They are now in this group that has been set up, called Chartwell Crafts, where they do tapestries on commission, but they need some assistance in addition to that to enable it to continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thanks to their parents, it looks as though they will be able to keep it going until about February of 1993. Then they are doomed to going home and having nothing more to do with their day than to watch the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Midday Show</EMPHASIS>. Not one of them has been given the slightest opportunity to obtain a job anywhere else. As artists, as they are at the present time, their confidence is as high as one could possibly expect it to be. They have self-esteem. They are much better integrated into society. But, because of the interpretation of the Disability Services Act, they will be sent home from Chartwell Crafts, and watching television will be about the best that they can hope for to fill in their days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we talk about getting people with disabilities into the community and into employment, I believe that it is time we had a serious look at the actual skills that these young people have. A great deal of time and effort has been invested in training them for the skills that they have. They are artists. All of them have been in classes previously where it has been attempted to teach art in this way to many more students, but these are the ones who have actually gone on and developed their skills, not only in tapestry but in drawing and other things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder what sort of a society it is we live in when we say, `You are a person with a disability; therefore you will not be supported to pursue your skill as an artist. You can go and do photocopying or car detailing or weed a garden'. Why do we fund other arts groups&mdash;orchestras, ballets and operas? We fund them because they are a valuable addition to our society. But for some reason art is not included as work for people with a disability and so they do not qualify for any assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The irony of all of this is that there are a couple of groups in Canberra, including from DEET, which have sent people for work experience to Chartwell Crafts, because of the value of what is being done there and because of what they can learn by spending up to six weeks with the students at Chartwell Crafts. DEET see it as a valuable part of our society. I think ACT TAFE has also been involved with them. But the Disability Services Act administrators will not be shifted. I say to Senator Bolkus that all of the needs have not been met. I invite him to have a look at this particular area, and to have some regard for the skills that artists have in this area, just as we do with able-bodied people. </PARA>

I attempted to raise this matter the other day when Senator Collins, the Minister representing the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly), failed to provide an answer to a series of questions on this matter, which I had lodged with the Minister back in August.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In September, the Minister wrote to me saying that she still could not provide an answer. That was roughly within the 30 days in which she should have provided an answer. The Minister only just provided me with an answer the other day. I found that answer unsatisfactory in its contents and there was no explanation as to why it had come so late. I have spoken many times in the Senate of my opposition to this mining project at Shoalwater Bay. I have spoken quite vigorously in defence of the proposition that Shoalwater Bay should become a World Heritage area. It has absolutely magnificent wilderness qualities. The value of that whole area&mdash;roughly 1,000 square kilometres&mdash;has been extolled by CSIRO scientists as an ecological laboratory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some 30 per cent of Australia's species occur in that area. It lies at the intersection between the tropical area and the more temperate parts of Australia. It runs from a coastal region, which involves the waters contiguous to the Great Barrier Reef, right back through mangrove swamps, tropical rainforest areas and mountains. It runs about 30 kilometres inland. It has very unusual, diverse landscapes and dune systems, and, of course, the species which accompany them. It has pristine and reliable water sources which are absolutely essential to the well-being of the people of Rosslyn Bay and various other local communities. The irreversible destruction that would be caused by the mining of the dunes and the impossibility of restoring the dunes to their original condition is something which should cause a great deal of concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The short term nature of the proposed mining project, compared with the long term benefits of eco-tourism, the fishing industry&mdash;which is very concerned about damage to the dunes&mdash;and the preserving of the water supply are all issues that are of very high priority. There is a very high likelihood of the project not being viable economically. The former Bureau of Mineral Resources has stated that there is a 98 per cent probability that the project would show zero, or less, rate of return. </PARA>

Finally, on the environmental aspects, there is widespread opposition by local and national environmental groups to the project. The local shire council has come out quite strongly against it. I think many honourable senators would have seen Peter Garrett's program about this on Channel 7 a week or so back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to raise other issues in relation to Pivot Projects Pty Ltd, Pivot NL and the Pivot Group Ltd and the one individual involved in these projects, Mr Peter Laurance. Mr Peter Laurance, one of the directors of Pivot Projects Pty Ltd, has been recommended for investigation by the royal commissioners into the Tricontinental affair. According to a report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> of 24 September 1992, Tricontinental lost $55m on its loans to Mr Peter Laurance's company Pivot Group Ltd. According to a report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 18 November 1992, Victorian taxpayers footed the bill for more than $80m in debts incurred by companies owned by Mr Peter Laurance and his family. It just so happens that Mr Peter Laurance is the chairman of the Queensland Tourist and Travel Corporation. He and his family are the sole shareholders of Q-West Company, which is mainly an investment and management consultancy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Transaction report No. 16 of the report of the Tricontinental commissioners records the investigation relating to a portion of Tricontinental shares in Windsor Resources NL, a company whose main activities were gold production and mineral exploration. The portion of Tricontinental's shares in question were held on a profit share arrangement on behalf of Mr Laurance of Q-West. The report refers to the secretary of Q-West informing Mr Ian Johns of Tricontinental on 18 June 1987 that its fee for the provision of investment and property advice was $86,000. It further records that Mr Laurance had returned the cheque for $72,000 and requested that a cheque be made payable to a company by the name of Portsaid Investments Ltd. I have been unable to trace this company through the Australian Securities Commission database and I therefore presume that this company is based offshore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report records that due to time constraints the Commission was unable to fully investigate an investment banking facility relating to Windsor. However, it did state that further matters to be investigated are whether any information relating to Windsor not generally available in the market was provided to Mr Laurance of Q-West and the terms of any arrangement between Tricontinental and Mr Laurance to share profit on the sale of Windsor shares. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commission concludes by recommending that the Australian Securities Commission should investigate whether there was any fraud in respect of these transactions. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission finds that the various dealings outlined in this transaction report have an air of contrivance about them which warrants further investigation by the Australian Securities Commission. The amounts involved, and the possibly fraudulent nature of the activities, are sufficient to justify such a course, which the Commission recommends.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the light of that recommendation, the Commission believes it would be inappropriate for it to express any tentative conclusions on the issues involved.</PARA>
<PARA>The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 20 November 1992 ran a story that the Australian Securities Commission is currently examining the business deal involving Mr Peter Laurance and his company Q-West. The question therefore must be asked: is it appropriate for the Commonwealth to be entering into a contract with an individual who is being investigated by the Australian Securities Commission?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the Pivot Mining NL company. This is one of the companies involved in the sandmining project at Shoalwater Bay. According to the 1992 annual report of the company, Pivot Mining has entered into irrevocable contractual obligations to purchase interests in sandmining areas at Shoalwater Bay. The annual return of the company states that the company's principal activity during the year ending 30 June 1991 was that of enhancing and developing mining interests. Prior to that, the principal activity of the company was that of hiring marine recording equipment. Another question must be asked: what does this indicate about the experience and expertise of this company in carrying out mining activities particularly in such an environmentally sensitive area as Shoalwater Bay?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issued capital of this company on 30 June 1991 was a mere $1. This was increased to $5, subsequent to the date of the accounts attached to the 1991 annual returns. Although the accounts reflected efficiency of working capital, they have been drawn up on the basis that the company is a going concern. This is based on the potential of the lease agreements for mining in Shoalwater Bay. As I have mentioned, the former Bureau of Mineral Resources has indicated that there is a 98 per cent probability that the project will show a zero or less rate of return. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These matters raise serious concerns over insurance and about the ability of the companies concerned to raise sufficient capital to provide comprehensive insurance for the project. One could refer here to the shocking state in which the Magnetic Keys development on Magnetic Island has been left as a consequence of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority not carrying through its deed of agreement in relation to $20m worth of insurance on that development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1991 financial statements of Pivot Projects Pty Ltd reveal that the company involved a massive loss of over $22.5m, and this raises further very serious questions about the financial viability of the companies and the appropriateness of the Government's involvement. That is the point that I want to come back to. The accounts of Pivot Group Ltd, the holding company of Pivot Projects Pty Ltd, for the year ending 30 June 1991, reveal that notice has been received of proceedings in the Federal Court against Pivot Projects Pty Ltd and other related parties, claiming damages under section 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974. Section 52 provides:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A corporation shall not, in trade or commerce . . . engage in conduct that is misleading or deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive.</PARA>
<PARA>So questions must be asked about the appropriateness of the Commonwealth engaging in an agreement with companies and individuals that have not proved in the past to be financially responsible. One might rather cynically note that, Tricontinental having lost over $80m with respect to Mr Peter Laurance's companies, Mr Peter Laurance is now head of the Tourist Corporation in Queensland, trying through his advertising, which has been much criticised in recent days, to inveigle other Victorians to go up to Queensland and spend even more money there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leaving that aside, the ability of this company to carry out these activities is very much in question. Of course, I am particularly interested because, having asked questions about this matter back in August, the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) found that she could not reply in September and we still have no explanation as to why the Federal Government, a Federal Labor Government, has not provided an explanation as to the delay. It certainly smells of an implication of the Federal Government in a deal with the Queensland Labor Government to protect the interests of Mr Peter Laurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One needs to be very concerned that an area of such prime importance from an environmental point of view is likely to be despoiled as a consequence of activities by a company that has such a shocking record and which, on all the evidence, is not capable of carrying out the mining operation and is not likely to make any profit for itself or for Australia. It is very important that these matters be put on the record and that the Federal Government rethink its attitude with respect to the leases in this important area. </PARA>

It was in relation to an alleged bribe of a Cabinet Minister in the Queensland Government and I made a plea that the reportage of the material tabled be done by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> in Queensland. It was interesting to note that that did not occur. The only note in the metropolitan press was by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Telegraph</EMPHASIS> on 6 December where it stated:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>Prior to tabling that material, legal advice was sought from a number of sources which contradicted the statement of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS>. The report, however, was carried by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gold Coast Bulletin</EMPHASIS>. It was also carried by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunshine Coast Daily</EMPHASIS> but no further reports occurred.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I made a plea on that occasion for the media to investigate the material that was tabled.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Tuesday, 8 December, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> at least ran a report entitled, `Media blocks reform, journalist tells EARC'. It stated:</PARA>

<PARA>Mr Dickie was a journalist with the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> and, if anybody should be aware of the circumstances surrounding these matters, it is he.

There is a continuing smell of corruption in Queensland that cannot be covered up. Further material has come to my attention which I will be presenting at a future date. I believe that this is of fundamental importance to the continuing development and reforms that must occur as a result of the Fitzgerald inquiry because there are matters being covered up. There are rumours, as yet unsubstantiated, of corruption within Queensland. I believe that this saga will continue.

Because of her general physical debility, it is unlikely that she will be fit for surgery and it is anticipated that at that time she will be told, `Sorry, it is too late.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Reid referred earlier in this matters of public interest debate to comments by the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) earlier this week with regard to the disability field. I would also like to correct a very obvious misstatement, whether deliberate or not, by the Minister representing the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Tuesday, 8 December, Senator Sherry asked Senator Bolkus a question relating to proposals to increase the disability support pension. Senator Sherry went on to ask:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Has the Minister seen other proposals to support the disabled? Are those proposals feasible and will the Government implement them?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Bolkus engaged in quite a lengthy answer which really did not get to the point. However, when he started to refer to the coalition's policies in this area, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For instance, the Fightback package proposes a number of measures, the main one of which is a fortnightly allowance of some $45 for the severely disabled&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>At that point, Senator Bolkus was interrupted by various interjections and when he came back to the record he went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I really need to go to the point that Dr Hewson in recent weeks told a number of disabled people in Adelaide at a conference of ACROD that he would extend the $45 allowance to cover all DSP pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA>That quote is patently wrong. Senator Bolkus then indicated that he had had some advice&mdash;I hope it was not from the Department of Community Services, which should have been better advised&mdash;by means of which he drew out figures from the initial Fightback costings of $57m. Senator Bolkus's guesstimate&mdash;and I can only call it a guesstimate&mdash;was that the changes would, in effect, cost some $200m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, Senator Bolkus must have been drawing a wild and fanciful story, because I am sure that departmental officers were present at the ACROD conference in Adelaide, which was very well attended. I need to put on the record exactly what Dr Hewson said. Let me quote from the transcript of his speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I don't want to raise unrealistic hopes about what Government action can achieve and I certainly don't want to make exaggerated promises about what the coalition will do. But I can point to Fightback's significant benefits for people with disabilities, both as a target group and as members of the wider community. The most important direct benefit in Fightback&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>here he is referring to that disability audience that he is talking to&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe is an entirely new allowance of $45 a fortnight to be paid to people with severe disabilities. I am aware that there has been some confusion about whether this would apply to all people with 70 per cent disability or only those who are also receiving the disability pension. So let me clear that up here and now. All people with 70 per cent disability will receive that allowance irrespective of whether they are receiving the pension. So not just the pensioners but everybody with a 70 per cent disability.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Bolkus made no attempt in his answer, or in his obvious guesstimates of finances, to draw on the statement of fact by Dr Hewson relating to the provision of these facilities&mdash;very importantly, to people who have a 70 per cent disability. In that respect, Senator Bolkus totally drew on false information and misled the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Territories Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 makes minor technical amendments to the Christmas Island Act 1958 and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act 1955. This legislation has been requested by the Western Australian Government in the context of the Western Australian Government's decision to move forward with its own legislation. The Indian Ocean Territories (Administration of Laws) Bill was introduced into the Western Australian Parliament on 11 November 1992, passed through the Legislative Assembly on 26 November, and the Western Australian upper House, without amendment, on 2 December 1992.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two amendments are not controversial, with one amendment relating to the technical manner of application of Western Australian laws. That is, the Christmas Island Act and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act currently provide that the provisions of the law of Western Australia are in force in each Territory `so far as they are capable of applying to the Territory'. This is logically prior to the modification of applied laws by ordinances, which causes Western Australia concern regarding the applicability of these ordinances. The Bill removes the reference in both the Christmas Island Act and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act to the applicability of Western Australian law. This will remove any doubt. Provisions incapable of application will still not have any real effect, but will be described as part of the law in force in the Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other amendment concerns the exercise of judicial and related powers that are applied to laws by Territory or State courts and court officers. Western Australia has sought a range of amendments of these provisions to refer to court officers rather than judicial officers, as currently applies. This will enable officers to be able to deal more comprehensively and consistently with the full range of courts and tribunals of the State. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators will recall that earlier this year this Parliament passed the Territories Law Reform Bill 1992, an important piece of constitutional legislation. Essentially, it replaced a Singaporean based regime with a Western Australian based body of law. Some 700 pieces of Western Australian Acts of Parliament were transferred in their administration to these Indian Ocean islands as a result of this legislation. These Western Australian laws are subject to modification by ordinance under the Christmas Island Act and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act. We have already seen a number of pieces of legislation which have been repealed or their operations suspended, or modification of the legislation for application on the islands. I have noted with interest the comments made by the Western Australian member for Kingsley, Mrs Cheryl Edwardes, who is the shadow Minister in this area, regarding the Indian Ocean Territories becoming part of the Western Australian State electorate. She says of Christmas and Cocos (Keeling) Islands:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . could become part of our electorate at some time in the future. That has already been recommended, although it has not been taken up in this legislation. However, I am sure that within the next of couple of years that series of islands could become part of Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>In the long term, this is a very valid point. My main concern at present is that, given that the laws of Western Australia now apply to Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands, the residents of these islands have no representation in the Parliament of Western Australia where the bulk of their laws will now be made. These islands are, coincidentally, part of my own electorate and they are also part of the electorate of Senator Collins for voting purposes at Federal elections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A very formal community of interest, particularly in the provision of education and health services, has been built up with Western Australia. The community of interest of many of the families is now, as Mr Acting Deputy President would be aware, with communities in Perth and with those in Port Hedland. Looking to the future, the application of Western Australian law will inevitably lead to the incorporation of those islands into the State of Western Australia. I am certainly looking at initiating discussions on behalf of the Federal Opposition with the respective representative bodies on both of those islands to ensure that constitutional progress can be made in that regard in the long term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to comment on the operation of the Christmas Island casino. The member for Kingsley made further comments about the operation of casinos in Western Australia. The applicability of this legislation applies very much to that casino. In her speech, Mrs Edwardes said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Commonwealth Government must bring the infrastructure of the islands up to mainland standards. The establishment of the casino complex may mean that the Island achieves financial independence from Australia. The casino is expected to bring around 40,000 people to the islands mainly from Indonesia. It is important that this Bill be passed to ensure that the Christmas Island casino will provide the same level of operation and service that is provided by the Burswood Casino. From a Western Australian point of view any competitor to the Burswood Casino should be operated under the same conditions.</PARA>
<PARA>The operation of a casino on Christmas Island is intended to be effected at some stage in this financial year. In the recent Estimates and Appropriations debates, I was able to ascertain from the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) and her officers that that particular program has been slowed because of problems with the construction details and the construction program. However, it is important that laws and the applicability of these laws are in place to ensure that if and when that casino is up and running&mdash;and hopefully the target date of March 1993 will be achieved&mdash;we ensure that there is a comparability and an appropriate checking of those operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have also noted in recent days the appointment of a new administrator, Mr John Read, to Cocos (Keeling) Islands. The appointment by the Minister for the Arts and Territories (Ms Fatin) is nothing less than a job for the boys. Mr Read is a former Cabinet Secretary to the Western Australia Inc. Premier, Brian Burke. He received $15,000 from the discredited Labor leader's account in 1989, and after he was not re-elected to the Western Australian Parliament in that year, he was also given a special State development job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very interesting to note that Mr Read has held party political positions in branches in Western Australia associated with the Minister for Arts and Territories, and there have been associations in the various preselections that date back to 1982. It had been widely rumoured in Western Australia that Mr Read was in line for preselection for a safe Labor upper House seat, but obviously in some deal that has been done in Western Australia as part of the numbers game that was changed and he was given the job of Administrator, Cocos (Keeling) Islands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this regard, I have placed questions on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> to both the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the senior portfolio Minister, Mrs Kelly. I hope they will be answered in the next week or so to ensure that we have a full documentation of all the issues surrounding Mr Read's appointment that should be properly available to this Senate before he assumes the position of Administrator for the Islands. I will continue to question this appointment as there are serious questions surrounding an appointment to such an important position that will have particular relevance to this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was pleased to note that last week there was an election for a new shire council on Christmas Island and a number of new councillors have taken office. It will be important that under the Territories law reform legislation the new council exercises a proper and full consultative role in implementing all of the legislation and any changes necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the Opposition supports this legislation, it is concerned that such a small piece of legislation could have been dealt with through the correct process of the Territories Law Reform Act. If the Department had consulted with the relevant authorities in Western Australia, instead of rushing the original legislation through Parliament&mdash;honourable senators will recall that that took place last June&mdash;with virtually no consultation with the island communities or the Western Australian Government, this piece of legislation would not have been necessary. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will keep my remarks to a minimum to see whether we can deal with the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill before 2 o'clock. Very briefly, this proposal is a result of a backflip by the Government. In 1990 new proposals by the Government were brought into force. The Opposition did not oppose the Bill and, indeed, what occurred on that occasion was that the number of people who were to be eligible for the EMDG scheme was limited.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give honourable senators some statistics. In the grant year of 1990-91, Austrade processed 2,002 claims for grants under the EMDG scheme, with a value of $143m. This compared with 3,035 claims with a value of $179.6m in the 1989-90 grant year. The decline in numbers was attributed to the change in the scheme which came into effect on 1 July 1990, so that in 1991-92 a total of 2,401 claims were processed, with a total value of $127.4m. In other words, the scheme was to be limited because, as a result of a report by Professor Helen Hughes, it was found that there was no particular causal link between exports and the scheme itself. However, in desperation, the Labor Party, looking for some sort of initiative to try to make up the volume of exports that it might be able to try to claim some credit for&mdash;panic measures, one could call them&mdash;has made a complete reversal of policy and let back into the scheme those people that its amendments and its policy excluded in 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is yet another back flip by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), a turnaround, a reversal of policy&mdash;any of those emotional terms could be used. It is a clear example of the desperation politics of a Labor Government that has given us one million unemployed, an international debt of $162 billion, and no policies to deal with that problem. The Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) was the first one to admit in the chamber that there were no policies. We had a whole debate on it here yesterday. Again we see that the Labor Party has no policy at all to deal with the economic decline in Australia. On the other hand, the Fightback package will allow $1.7 billion in taxes which are presently imposed upon exports to be abolished. That will effectively make us more competitive and allow us to have the chance to export in a far more meaningful way than the manner which the Government proposes by this back flip on its policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Business Council of Australia and the Industry Commission have said that the implementation of the policies advocated by the coalition&mdash;to abolish, along with other taxes, payroll tax, wholesale sales tax and the fuel excise&mdash;could boost gross domestic product by a figure of at least 15 per cent, or some $60 billion, and that would go a long way towards meeting the monthly repayments on the huge debt that the Government has allowed to be built up. The Fightback initiatives, particularly those aimed at accelerating micro-economic reform, will benefit exporters to a far greater extent than any back flip on the EMDG scheme. In this context, we have a government with no policies trying to turn around and reintroduce a failed policy. What we need is an election and the Fightback  policy  to  give  Australia  a chance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I refer to today's terrible unemployment statistics and, in particular, to the fact that between October and November a further 78,400 Australians lost their jobs. In light of these awful figures, I ask the Minister again, as I have almost every day for the last few weeks, whether the Government is going to do something about this continuing list of jobless, this jobs collapse. When are we going to see something from this Government that can be directed to the tragedy that its policies have created?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So far as the last part of the question is concerned and the allegation that this Government's policies have created these levels of unemployment, we have to make similar criticisms of other governments around the world which have exactly the same levels of unemployment&mdash;particularly the model that those opposite always use, the Thatcher type model in England, which has produced extraordinary levels of unemployment and a huge deficit.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are not disappointing to those opposite, of course. They always get excited when unemployment figures go up because they hope they can benefit from them. During November full time employment fell by 15,700 and part time employment fell by 62,000. The figures are showing, however, a great deal of volatility and they are jumping around almost as much as coalition policies have been jumping around. The decline in employment was concentrated in New South Wales. In Victoria and Western Australia, employment actually rose: for example, in Western Australia the unemployment figure was reduced by one per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have difficulty in believing it in respect of any of these figures State by State, but these are the ABS figures. However, the unemployment rate moved around substantially driven by changes in the labour force participation rate: for example, the unemployment rate fell in New South Wales and rose in Victoria despite the rise in employment in that State.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will see a sustained improvement in employment with further consolidation of recovery in economic activity. The September quarter national account showed GDP growth at 2.1 per cent over the year. Job market indicators suggest that we can expect an improvement in employment. For example, CES job vacancies rose in the September quarter to their highest level in two years; the ANZ employment advertisement index for November shows a modest and continuing pick up; and the DEET skilled vacancy index shows a continuing rise in recent months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Budget measures will create further jobs, assist the recovery and ensure employment growth in the longer term. With last year's November statement, One Nation, and the youth employment measures, this Government has allocated $2.7 billion of expenditure to infrastructure and labour market programs in 1992-93&mdash;all of which Dr Hewson, the leader of those opposite, says he would walk away from. We do not know what he will say next week, but that is what he was saying previously, just as he tried in this place to abort the recovery by talking down the importance of lowering interest rates in 1991.</PARA>

I know that an awful Christmas is ahead for almost another 80,000 as demonstrated by these figures. But the Minister seems to be saying to the Senate that the Government is still not going to offer anything new&mdash;no new policies at all, no change of direction; in fact, nothing but more of the same, and that is those Government policies which have been demonstrated to have failed, and which are continuing to fail.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I have already said in the answer to the first part of the question, there are no changes of policy which can produce instant results in respect of employment. The employment situation will improve as we get a recovery in the Australian economy. Senator Hill talks about my recognising the tragedy. Yesterday Dr Hewson discovered that the recession was deeper than he thought. After a year of peddling Fightback around the community, stuffing it up drainpipes and things like that, he suddenly found the recession was worse than he thought. Or did he find something else was worse than he thought&mdash;the judgment on Opposition policies as being much worse than he thought when he announced Fightback. The only alternative offered here is some relief on payroll tax and that, for reasons which I have outlined before, is not a viable option.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government will plump for fairness and independence when there are disputes between employers and workers. It will have reference to an independent umpire, such as the Industrial Relations Commission, to make determinations rather than a situation in which individual employers and workers are required to strike individual work contracts, with employees being called into the office of the employers, as the policy of the Opposition requires, in order to reach an agreement, and to be confronted by unscrupulous employers with the choice, `Take these terms or be dismissed'&mdash;the contract or the sack.</PARA>

For example, 100,000 new jobs were created in manufacturing industry up to 1990, and that reversed a trend which had been going on for a very long time.

This is a chapter VII UN Charter enforcement operation which the Security Council has unanimously authorised. While it does break quite new ground by committing the United Nations to enforcement action to secure humanitarian relief, not too many people&mdash;with the possible exception of Dr Kissinger, whose remarks I noticed this morning&mdash;would think that it is a bad precedent to be set, at least for extreme situations like the one prevailing in Somalia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The immediate objective of this operation is the alleviation of the horrendous suffering that has been created by famine and civil and political chaos in the country and the disarming of factions and other freelance bandits as far as possible. Both of these objectives should be capable of achievement within a relatively short time frame of two or three months, but we cannot get a conclusive opinion about that at this stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The US expects to deploy up to 28,000 of its troops to Somalia by early January. A number of other countries, including France, Canada and Zimbabwe, have also offered specific contributions at this stage. As to Australia's contribution, I was asked by the US Ambassador earlier this week whether we would consider, first, contributing to this enforcement operation and, secondly, making an additional contribution to the existing UN peacekeeping operation in Somalia known as UNOSOM. The Government is considering various options in this respect, and decisions will be taken shortly. I am not in a position, however, to indicate right now what our reaction will be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia remains committed to participating in UNOSOM, at least to the present extent already committed through the 30-member movement control unit of whom 11 are already deployed, seven of them in-country. UNOSOM is a peacekeeping operation which will need to replace the shorter term enforcement operation once that shorter term operation has completed its tasks. We hope that the enforcement action and then the expanded UNOSOM will be able to quickly create the conditions conducive to the formation of a stable government in Somalia. The task ahead for UNOSOM is to support national reconciliation in Somalia and to prevent a return to chaos and lawlessness once the enforcement operation is completed.</PARA>

All information on patients will be held by the doctors or the service providers as is the present case. If doctors wish to participate, they may, but it is purely voluntary; there is no mandatory or compulsory element in this whatsoever.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a lot of interjection of `Hear, hear' from the other side of the chamber, but just let me make a first point in relation to those interjections. On a seasonally adjusted basis at the present time, there are 123,200 young people looking for full time work; the unadjusted number is a bit lower than that. This level of youth unemployment is considerably better than the 158,100 full time unemployed 15- to 19-year-olds we inherited from the Liberal Government when we came to office; it is a considerably better figure. So in respect of the `Hear, hears', let me say that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services, Mr Baldwin, recently launched the training and employment offer for young long term unemployed people. He did that on 16 November. It is only a month since that was done and, of course, any success of that program would not be reflected in the figures to which Senator Sowada refers. This offer is one of the many initiatives arising from the youth summit held in July. I must say, as I have said before in answering questions on these figures, these initiatives are not magic wands; they will take time to take effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the reason for the 22 per cent fall in full time youth unemployment which has occurred, of course, is related very much to education and labour market policies generally.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have an open mind on questions of possible financial cuts and I am prepared to accept advice from almost anyone. The Opposition has advised me that $70m is capable of being cut from the Austrade budget. That is what it says in Fightback, but I have had a look at that and I do not believe that any such cuts are remotely warranted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An extensive program of restructuring and revitalisation of Austrade has occurred since the McKinsey report. It has meant that the organisation is more efficient and more productive than it has ever been, with a particularly effective emphasis now in place on promoting trade in the Asia-Pacific region, and that is very widely recognised by Australian exporters. The Commission has boosted its efforts in the Asia-Pacific area so that 50 per cent of its overseas resources are now concentrated in Asia, and a number of Austrade offices have recently been opened in the region in countries quite fundamental to our trading future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proportion of Austrade's operating budget spent on administration will be less than 20 per cent in 1992-93. If the Austrade budget were to be cut by the amount the Opposition suggests, it would mean a cut of more than 50 per cent in operating funds, and a major cutback in export promotion at a time when it is universally agreed by all Australian businesses that an increase in export promotion is vital to this country's future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is at least one person who agrees completely with what I have been saying; someone who knows that this kind of cut cannot be made, who has been going around overseas telling Australian exporters that it will not be made, even with a change of Government; someone who has been talking behind his Leader's back in this respect. I am referring, of course, to Mr Peacock, the Opposition trade spokesman, who said that that $70m cut will not be implemented. I think it is a fair question to ask whether this will be an area where Dr Hewson will come clean in his jellyback review next week, or will he continue to dissimulate about this and other indefensible and unachievable cuts still being on the table.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to aid, the story is a similar one. Under this Government's policy, the aid budget this year is $1.4 billion which is equivalent to 0.36 per cent of gross national product. In contrast, the Opposition has said that it is possible to&mdash;and that it will&mdash;slash $209m from the aid budget, reducing it to 0.3 per cent of GNP in 1992-93 and 0.28 per cent in 1993-94. That would take Australia to the bottom third of the OECD ranking of aid donor countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Hill is going around telling the aid and NGO lobbies that it is all perfectly achievable because most of that reduction will come out of the DIFF money that goes to support commercial enterprise. I am able to say, again, on reliable information I have received, that Mr Peacock is going around at the same time telling Australian exporters, `Don't worry, DIFF won't be cut'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a classic example of utter dissimulation on the part of the Opposition.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, on the point of order: since I am the one who yesterday sought a ruling on whether `monstrous untruth' was unparliamentary, I think it is appropriate that I should suggest to you that there is no inconsistency whatsoever in treating `monstrous untruth' one way and `demonstrable untruth' in another way. A `demonstrable untruth' is an untruth that may have been uttered in ignorance in a situation of what the truth was, and it can be demonstrated to be untruthful, but that is not the same as saying that someone has said a lie. A lie is where there is an intention to tell an untruth. When a person uses a word like `monstrous', what he or she is implying is that it is a dirty, big, fat untruth that is being uttered; it is something that is deliberate; it is something that is in fact, for all practical purposes, a lie.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier this week, Senator Archer asked a question about charges for the stevedoring of containers in Australia compared with New Zealand, using data from a report by the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics and the New Zealand Ministry of Transport called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Monitoring of Trans-Tasman Shipping</EMPHASIS>. This report was released in May this year, but it clearly states that its data reflects a joint survey conducted in mid-1991. This was at least six months before all Australian ports were restructured through enterprise employment agreements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since then, the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority has confirmed that the Australian reform program has fostered intense competition between stevedores. This resulted in reductions in Australian container handling charges on the trans-Tasman trade from $278 to $294 quoted in that report down to $190 to $210 per container depending on commercial negotiations. This decline also is confirmed by the Chairman of the Australian Shipping Users Group, Mr Mark Reyner, in an article in the October 1992 edition of the Business Council bulletin magazine where current Australian container handling rates are quoted as between $180 and $200 per standard container.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not aware of any comprehensive, formal evaluation of the New Zealand process across all ports. However, the results arising from the Australian reform process, including the doubling of productivity, the halving of labour numbers and crane rates equivalent to comparable international ports, equate with anecdotal claims from New Zealand. There is no problem acknowledging that the previous Labour Government in New Zealand did a good job in reforming their waterfront. However, Australia has done just as well. It is a pity that critics continue to rely on outdated comparisons with New Zealand made before the Australian reforms were fully effective to try to discredit the achievements of the Australian stevedoring reform.</PARA>

<PARA>Every time I ask questions about the Prime Minister's piggery companies breaching the law, all I get is personal abuse. I am  never given a substantive answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> asked questions which were not given a substantive answer by the Prime Minister. Yet here we have a situation where the Government is pretending that a serious problem does not exist. It does exist and it simply will not go away. That problem goes to the heart of the integrity of the Prime Minister of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister's companies which he half owns, and on which he has a nominee as a director, have filed dodgy, shonky returns with the Australian Securities Commission which the ASC is forcing them to correct. The corrections that have been filed at the demand of the ASC have clearly shown that these returns were required to be corrected. They were false and misleading, and that is why they are being corrected by the companies themselves at the demand of the ASC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have only seen a few of these corrections so far, and many more are still required to be filed, but they reveal the incredible device by which the Prime Minister's investment of $430,000 for his half interest magically turned into $4.2m worth of shareholder's equity within six weeks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating has denied on television that he has made that paper fortune. He said that one had to be able to read a balance sheet to understand. I have news for Mr Keating: people who know very well how to read a balance sheet confirm exactly this problem. If Mr Keating has not made this paper fortune, he has to deny the accounts; he has to demonstrate that the accounts are shonky. The accounts filed and available to us this week confirm the point made in the Euphron accounts that he has converted a $430,000 investment into $4.2m. Mr Keating cannot get away with saying both that the accounts are correct and that he did not turn the investment into $4.2m. One of those things has to be wrong. The big question is: are the accounts wrong? That is for Mr Keating to tell us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have my own views about the accounts but, as they have not been audited&mdash;in breach of the law&mdash;one can have whatever sort of view one might like to have about them. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> is one of the few newspapers in Australia with the courage to print the facts about this piggery group. The rest of the Press Gallery, with one or two honourable exceptions, have been terrorised by this Prime Minister. They have been personally rung up and abused; their editors have been rung up at home and insulted if they have dared to print anything about this prime ministerial investment in these companies which have an extraordinary capacity to breach the corporations law.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I share Senator Baume's concerns about the matters he raised, but I have some other concerns that relate to the general investment scheme. Whilst Senator Evans is in the chamber, it might be appropriate to deal with them at this point. Senator Evans gave me an answer which was definitely in good faith. I previously provided him with copies of the documents which were tabled and with an explanation of those documents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may have slipped Senator Evans's attention, because he was not present at the hearing yesterday morning of the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs, but the head of the Quarantine Division of AQIS, Mr John Landos, indicated to the Committee that when he visited Copenhagen in September 1990 he had a meeting with both our Ambassador and the Austrade officer in Copenhagen. At that point in time, those two gentlemen indicated to Mr Landos numerous details about the proposed joint venture, including the value of the proposed joint venture; the target market; the fact that there was an intention to import genetic material; and other details about the proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is obvious that it was not just a single event. It was not just a case of Mr Hansen from the Federation of Danish Industries returning to Denmark from Australia in November 1990 and saying everything had been fixed up, because two months before his return Mr Landos was in Copenhagen and received numerous details from the Ambassador and the Austrade officer that related to the proposal&mdash;details which, it transpired, in the course of time turned out to be correct. There is very clear evidence that there was a course of dealings with Austrade, possibly with our embassy and with the Federation of Danish Industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is very important, because it has been suggested by AQIS officials that there was never an application to import genetic material. It was suggested earlier on by AQIS officials&mdash;I know Senator Evans is not responsible for AQIS&mdash;that there had been no contact between AQIS and the Danes on this proposal between April 1990 and April 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It subsequently transpired, when we examined all the documents, that contact did occur, as evidenced by newspaper reports, Austrade reports and faxes that went backwards and forwards. It goes right to the heart of whether the evidence which the Estimates Committee was presented with on 17 September and 21 October is correct. It also relates to who is doing the dealing with the Danes. If the Danes are saying that they have made an application to import genetic material and live pigs, but it has not been dealt with by AQIS, it could be that somebody at Austrade had given some sort of assurances. That is just one possibility. Whatever it is, I want to draw to Senator Evans's attention that there is a course of dealing which I do not think he was aware of and which has been evidenced by documents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Austrade officials were involved in this project as early as 2 May 1990 when they attended a meeting arranged by Mr Girdlestone from AQIS. An Austrade officer, I understand, was present and maybe somebody from DFAT as well. Clearly, there has been a course of dealings. It does need investigation, and that is why I have asked Senator Evans today to table all the information on their files about that. This goes right to the heart of who is running Austrade, how the investment decisions are being made, how our quarantine system is being run for the benefit of the primary industries in this country and what involvement there was with people involved with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent the Senator Hill moving a motion to provide for the consideration of a matter, namely a motion to provide for discussion of a matter of public importance concerning the refusal of the Government to implement policies to address the results of its economic mismanagement.</PARA>
<PARA>I understand that the Australian Democrats have agreed that we should be permitted to debate this issue for one hour, so presumably this suspension motion will be carried. Moving this procedural motion gives me the opportunity to express personally how terrible today's figures are. We got the first sign today from this Government of any admission of recognition of the extent of the tragedy. In fact, I thought for a moment that Senator Button was going to attempt to answer this question seriously. Instead of doing so, of course, he tried rather to take cheap political points. </PARA>

Under this Government's economic management, pursuant to its economic model, we now find in this country unemployment at the highest level since the Great Depression, 11.4 per cent. It is a deplorable figure, a figure about which this Government should be ashamed. Day after day we have said to this Government, `What are you going to do about this tragedy? How are you going to change your policies? What hope are you going to offer Australia for the future?' On no occasion has this Government been prepared to answer that question.

The urgency, of course, is that the latest tragic figure was released only a few hours ago. That is why it is a matter of public importance and a matter of urgency that should be debated in this chamber today. We now have 11.4 per cent unemployment. What is in some ways even worse is that in the last month a further 78,000 Australians have lost their jobs. Unemployment has actually increased. Those employed number 78,000 fewer than a month ago. If any figure ever demonstrated urgency, it must be that. It is a deplorable situation.</PARA></TALK.START>

Moving to Wollongong, which Senator Baume knows very well, the rate is 44.4 per cent.

More than half the young people looking for work cannot get work. If ever there were a demonstration of failure of government and government policies, it has to be these tragic figures.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Happy Christmas! Labor's gift to Australia for Christmas 1992 is record unemployment and absolutely no plan to get that record number of Australians back in a job. The Smith Family has said that this Christmas will be its most demanding on record. The Wesley Mission is calling this `the recession Christmas' and `the worst Christmas for Australian families in 60 years'. The New South Wales Labor Leader, Bob Carr, was dead right when he told the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . record unemployment under the Federal Labor Government would make this Christmas the bleakest in Australia since the Great Depression.</PARA>
<PARA>A Labor leader in New South Wales said that. In the new year another 200,000 school leavers will join the ranks of the victims of Keating's recession; 200,000 school leavers will be either on the dole or locked out of universities and TAFE. So there will be even less hope for the one million already on the dole queue, thanks to this Government, thanks to Senator Cook and Mr Keating. According to the ABS, there are now 979,900 Australians out of work, looking for work but unable to find it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real extent of the unemployment crisis is much greater than that. According to Access Economics, 900,000 supposedly full time workers are working less than five days a week; 200,000 part time workers are looking for full time work; 300,000 part time workers want to work longer hours; and 250,000 people have simply given up looking for work altogether. In effect, there are another 1.7 million Australians who are now unemployed or underemployed who do not show up in the official figures. The real picture is more like 2.6 million Australians who are either officially unemployed or underemployed or have given up looking for work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's unemployment rate is now a record 11.4 per cent&mdash;a total of 979,900 without work&mdash;a new post-Depression high or, should I say, a new low for this Government. It is an absolute rock bottom low in the management of this country. In November alone 78,400 people lost their jobs. Almost 80,000 people in one month lost their jobs&mdash;and Mr Keating told us that the recession had finished a long time ago. Every single day in Australia another 2,600 Australians are giving up looking for a job; that is 78,000 people in November. They lose any hope of ever finding work and they resign themselves to the worst Christmas they have ever had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only a year ago we thought the unemployment rate was bad. We thought it was disastrous at 10.5 per cent&mdash;894,000 people without a job&mdash;but in the last 12 months, since Mr Keating became Prime Minister, another 85,700 have become permanently unemployed. That is out of a total full time work force of 5,844,000. Almost six million in full time work, almost one million without any form of work. The real tragedy is that of those figures, 33 per cent of our youth are unemployed, simply unable to get jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real tragedy is that from this Government we have no plan, no policies, no vision, only rhetoric and more of the same that has gone on. It has no proposal. It will not even talk about any policy. It had this thing called One Nation, but that is now absolutely dead in the water; it has been officially killed off. In the Budget there were some programs which the Government said would be the centrepiece of our employment package. Only yesterday, Senator McMullan and Senator Tate admitted that the local capital works program, that was supposed to create 13,000 new jobs, created no new jobs at all. All it did was stop people who would have been thrown onto the unemployment queues from being thrown onto those queues. It kept them in a job and it did nothing to create new jobs for the one million of our fellow Australians who are without work. </PARA>

<PARA>He was talking about Federal Labor: no policy, an economic vacuum and in no shape to govern for the next three years. By contrast, the Liberal and National parties do have a plan to do something about unemployment. What we have to do in Australia is sell more overseas. We have to export more. If we can export more&mdash;sell more overseas&mdash;we will create more jobs in Australia because we will have to produce more of our manufactured goods, our mineral wealth and our agricultural expertise, and if we are producing more we create real jobs to get that production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How do we create additional exports in this big, bad, difficult world of international trade? We make our own exports cheaper. We do that in Australia by removing taxes from them. We propose in our policies to take $20 billion of taxes from business and exports in Australia. That is what Australia needs to get business moving, to create more competition with our exports and to sell more. In that way we will create real jobs that last, not like this Government, which throws money at them and when the money is stopped being thrown the jobs themselves stop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the most comprehensive policies ever released by any political party in Australia, unlike Mr Keating, the man whose hypocrisy in dealing with the economy is simply quite breathtaking. He told us, `We won't let there be a recession'. Then he said, `This is the recession we had to have'. Then he told us a few months ago that the recession had ended.

That is the tragedy and the sadness of this: those 700,000 kids who will look down the street and see their friends getting presents at this Christmas time and going on holiday, and they will not get a thing.

I am not going to be diverted into points of order, nor am I going to be gagged, as I was before, from presenting a viewpoint to this chamber. My point is that there are two issues that mark whether we are merely concerned, or concerned enough to do something about it. They are, in terms of major economic settings, vitally important to an understanding by ordinary Australians of this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first is that the Opposition's program for dealing with unemployment is to remove $6.4 billion from public expenditure. At a time when the OECD is urging its economies to invest in stimulating growth, the Opposition's proposal is to reduce growth by cutting public expenditure by $6.4 billion. The German economy is reflating itself. The Japanese economy is doing the same. Bill Clinton is promising that recipe for the United States. It is only here in Australia than an opposition is proposing to de-stimulate the economy and drive it into further recession by cutting public expenditure by that amount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one looks at where the Opposition wishes to cut, the story is more horrendous. If one looks at unemployment benefits as a mark of compassion and concern for the unemployed, the Opposition is proposing to terminate dole payments to unemployed persons after nine months. That is hardly a mark of compassion or concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through the One Nation statement we have committed a huge amount of public expenditure to getting the infrastructure of Australia into a better working order and to support private sector development based on the stimulus of the economy through public sector investment which adds to the assets of the economy at the same time. There are a number of indicators which show that that is beginning to have some effect. Let me go to some of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have gone now through four quarters of sustained positive GDP growth. Company pre-tax profits rose by 26 per cent in the October quarter, 67 per cent above the recession low. Retail sales increased by 2 per cent in the month of October 1992. The November skilled vacancy survey is up 13 per cent on November 1991. There are 13 per cent more vacancies for jobs now than there were this time last year. The CES unfilled vacancies are up by 24 per cent over the quarter, the highest since June 1990. The CES job placements are up by 119,000 over the quarter, of which 27 per cent are long term unemployed, the highest since September 1990. As well as that, the Australian Bureau of Statistics job vacancies indicator was up by 10.9 per cent in mid-May 1992. The ANZ Bank job vacancies survey was up by 0.6 per cent in November, 6.7 per cent over a year ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The level of overtime being worked in the economy is improving. Housing finance in owner occupied housing was up by 23.3 per cent in August 1991. Dwelling improvements have increased by 5.5 per cent. The number of people receiving Jobstart allowance and Newstart allowance fell by over 6,600 in October and November. In a reversal of the trend over the last couple of years, three of the last four months have shown falls. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I go to those statistics so that there can be an indication of the trends in the economy. The trends in the economy are for positive improvement. That may mean that the Opposition wishes to puncture that trend, but if we look at these latest figures today we see that the biggest effect is in New South Wales. Indeed, my colleague Kim Beazley said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The national results are largely due to developments in New South Wales. In that State employment fell by 58,700 (three-quarters of the national decline) . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The unemployment level for the country was dragged down by the performance of the New South Wales economy. South of the border from New South Wales, in Victoria, we see Jeff Kennett mugging the populace of Victoria and creating industrial turmoil, which is hardly something that will bring forth economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts are that we are stimulating the economy. That is the internationally recognised way for getting growth and employment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The figures that came out several hours ago showing 11.4 per cent unemployment are, of course, absolutely shocking, but I would have to agree with the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) that there is no point in us standing in here simply wringing our hands. Something needs to be done about it. As we have already seen from both the Government and the Opposition, there is little hope on the horizon that that figure will improve substantially, irrespective of who wins the next election. I think both sides have said that in the short to medium term there is not a great deal of hope in either of their patterns. Indeed, in recent days in Victoria we have seen Mr Kennett, the new Premier of Victoria, firing large numbers of people&mdash;in fact substantially increasing the unemployment there&mdash;and being praised for doing so by the Opposition as part of the process of getting the economy going.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Linked with unemployment, we have the other problems in the economy. As has just been pointed out, we are running up very large foreign debts. We have over $160 billion worth of foreign debt. But the patterns of change which have been implemented by the Government and which would be furthered by the Opposition are substantially similar. This is the point that I have made previously. The Government has been reducing tariffs progressively and substantially; the Opposition has been complaining consistently that tariffs have not been reduced fast enough, and stating that it would pull them away even more quickly. Dr Hewson has argued with the car industry that a zero tariff policy would actually aid the car industry. The car industry is telling him very loudly and very clearly that that policy is likely to wipe that industry out altogether. So in relation to tariff reduction there is little to choose between the Government and the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to tax concessions, the figures are already in: the Labor Government's period in office has resulted in a massive redistribution of wealth upwards from the less well off to the more wealthy. That has been done as a deliberate policy in the hope that the wealthy will invest in productive investment. We have seen that that has not happened. We have seen that money flow off into speculation, particularly property speculation&mdash;we have seen it go overseas&mdash;and the wealth of this country has been frittered away. Real wages of ordinary workers have seen the lowest increase&mdash;in fact, in real terms have seen a substantial decline&mdash;during the period of the Labor Government, but despite that the Liberal Opposition and its friends in big industry want to see wages further reduced. There is no evidence that further reductions in wages would lead to a turnaround in the economy, to an improvement in employment or indeed to a reduction in our foreign indebtedness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent days the argument has been made that the wealthy need to become more wealthy because that would provide money for investment. In the last 12 months we have seen that, while those on ordinary wages have become worse off, executive salaries have gone up by some 17 per cent. The wealth that has already been channelled in that direction has not gone into productive investment; it has gone to increase the salaries of the already wealthy and not back into the businesses of which they are the controllers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, this has come about through a policy of deregulation&mdash;deregulation of banking and deregulation of foreign exchange. There is nothing whatsoever in the Opposition's policy, in its Fightback program, which would turn that around. Indeed, Dr Hewson is on record specifically in relation to unemployment as saying that he would actually remove from the Reserve Bank the criterion that it has to take into account, namely, a concern for the employment in this country, and would leave the Reserve Bank only with a criterion of controlling interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent years we have all seen what happens to a country when that instrument is used as the instrument to try to prevent imports coming in. We have seen that the wealthy are the recipients of interest; that high interest rates in fact help them; and that they are then able to go out and buy more imports. In fact, increasing interest rates has not led to a reduction in imports. It is a very blunt and ineffective&mdash;in many respects a counterproductive&mdash;tool to be used. Yet that is the only tool that Dr Hewson would leave in the hands of the Reserve Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So one would expect that under a coalition government one would not see a turnaround in these high levels of unemployment and the high and growing levels of foreign indebtedness. I think most people now are recognising&mdash;the Minister made this point earlier&mdash;that interventionist policies are now the order of the day. We need to intervene strongly in the economy. We need governments which are no longer beholden to some abstract economic ideology but are beholden to the people who elect them, are beholden to Australians, and intervene strongly in the economy to turn it around. The only program which has been put before the Australian people which would intervene, and intervene successfully, to do this is the Democrats' <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Getting to Work</EMPHASIS> document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We recognise that with the large and growing foreign debt we need to increase government expenditure. But that cannot be had at the expense of the deficit increasing the foreign indebtedness. The only way that we can do that is to generate the revenues in this country, and the only way we can do that is to impose a jobs levy, as contained in our Getting to Work document. It is a program in which those who are well off and those who still have jobs help those who are without jobs. Those who are looked on with envy&mdash;according to Senator Macdonald a few moments ago, because they have jobs and because they are already well off&mdash;need to help the less well off by providing through a jobs levy the funding which would provide the employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to agree with Senator Macdonald that we will not solve the unemployment problem by simply throwing money at creating jobs which disappear when the money dries up.

As you know, Mr Acting Deputy President, the situation is far worse than that. If one adds to the people who are looking for work but who cannot find it those who are underemployed and those who have given up looking for a job out of absolute desperation&mdash;they have tried for so long that they have given up&mdash;and who are no longer included in these statistics, the situation is even worse. If we add to that the people who have a job but who are looking over their shoulder wondering whether they are going to be the next unemployed under Labor, the situation is even more depressing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said before, and it bears repeating, that in one sense it really does not matter what the unemployment rate is because those who are unemployed are 100 per cent unemployed. That is true at a personal level for someone who is unemployed. But for the nation's unemployment rate to go to where it has today is an absolute disgrace. In my State of South Australia, the situation is even worse than the national average. Western Australia scores in a sense the `best' unemployment rate at 10.3 per cent. What a disgrace for us to be saying that a State has the `best' unemployment rate at 10.3 per cent per cent. It is unbelievable! New South Wales follows with 11.1 per cent unemployment; Queensland, 11.3 per cent; Tasmania, 11.4 per cent; Victoria, 12.1 per cent; and then my State, 12.2 per cent, having shifted up from 11.4 per cent. It is an absolute and utter disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the job participation rate has fallen; people are no longer looking for work. So the percentages should be worse. If the people who have stopped looking for work were still looking for it, the percentages would be worse. As Senator Macdonald pointed out, 700,000 children this year will have a Christmas where neither of their parents&mdash;or their parent, if it is a sole parent household&mdash;has a job. It is not a very happy situation for people to be in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government acknowledges this situation. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook), who normally comes in here in a bombastic and argumentative way, came in and spoke much more softly today and said that this is not an occasion for hand wringing. That is true. But it is an occasion for the Government to start being honest with Australia and to admit what its policies will be at the next election&mdash;or to admit that it has none and that it has simply run out of ideas as to what to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The very best that the Minister could come up with were some indicators. He says to the nearly one million unemployed&mdash;or the well over one million unemployed if the underemployed and those who are no longer looking for work are included&mdash;`Don't worry, look at some of these economic indicators, they are getting better; so in the end employment will get better'. But we have been told month after month after month that recovery is on the way. Clearly, in the unemployment area, recovery is not on the way. It does not matter therefore that retail sales have gone up, that growth has been going up or that more people are working overtime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cook might reflect on the fact that if more people are working overtime there might be fewer new jobs. In a situation where we have over one million unemployed or underemployed, the best that Government members can come up with is to scratch their heads and say, `Well, retail sales and building improvements are going up and there are more vacancies than there were before'. That is the best they can offer. It is simply not good enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nation wants to hear of a plan from the Government to get Australia back on track and to get employment going. One might say that the Government has had 10 years in which to do that&mdash;and of course it has. It might bear repeating in this chamber what Mr Keating, the Prime Minister, said on 25 October this year in a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS> program. He said that unemployment is our biggest single problem. He is quite right in that respect; it is probably one of the few points on which he is right. He went on to say:</PARA>

<PARA>What a great job he has done. It is something about which I would have thought he would not be proud. But I am at a loss to imagine why, as recently as October this year, he would be prepared to admit the heavy hand that he has had in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast, as Senator Macdonald said, the coalition does have a plan. Day after day honourable senators opposite pick something that they think is wrong with the plan or they choose to misinterpret it. Some people have said that Government members tell straight out lies about the plan. For example, it is an untruth to say, as Senator Tate did on one occasion, that the coalition would make private health insurance mandatory. I believe that Senator Tate, if he did not know then, now knows that that is untrue. We hope that that sort of thing is not repeated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cook did a similar thing today when he said, `You people will tip everybody off whatever benefit they might get for being employed after nine months'. That is true, but it is not the whole truth. One can deceive by telling a half truth. It is an absolute disgrace that the best those opposite can offer is a misinterpretation of what we are offering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a plan to get taxes off the back of business&mdash;and that is how jobs are generated. As Senator Macdonald said, $20 billion worth of taxes that are currently put on the business community will be taken off it. They will be spread over the whole community. But that will mean that the price of the goods and services produced by the business community will come down. Obviously goods and services will become more competitive, but if the price comes down we will add a GST. The important thing to remember is that the price of those goods and services will be reduced without those $20 billion worth of tax on them. That means that we will be more competitive. We will be able to sell more goods overseas. If prices are more competitive, we will be able to export more. That is a very thin thumbnail sketch of a very extensive and well thought out program that we refer to as Fightback&mdash;but we have that plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable senators opposite have noted, with the recession being as deep as it is, that plan might now need some finetuning. Things have become far worse under this Government than even we imagined they would. But at least we have the brains to do something about it and to amend our plan. We want to see a plan from these people opposite to improve the situation in this nation and to do something about the unemployment problem. We do not want them to just keep promising more of the same and pointing to some half-baked economic indicators that say `It will all be all right, Jake' when we know that it will not be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, you would know that over the last fortnight there has been question after question to this Government about its plan to do something about unemployment, manufacturing or whatever. It simply does not have one. That is why, when we finally go to the polls, this Government will be tipped out of office and the people on this side will be in government. We have a plan to get Australia going again, to take the taxes off the business community and to make it more competitive and thereby create more real jobs. We will not just shuffle wealth around, as the Australian Democrats suggest. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

I find absolutely no joy at all in the labour force figures that were published today for the month of November 1992. As was pointed out earlier in this debate, using the seasonally adjusted figures, there has been a slight rise in the unemployment rate from 11.3 per cent in October to 11.4 per cent in November. I draw the attention of honourable senators to the trend figures that were published today, because they are very interesting indeed. They actually smooth out the month to month variations in the data that is calculated and published by the Bureau of Statistics. The trend figures show that there was no increase in unemployment between October and November; the unemployment rate was in fact constant at 11.2 per cent both in October and in November. I find that to be a high figure, but I do point out that there was no increase in the trend estimate between the two months.</PARA></TALK.START>

When we look at the trend estimates of unemployment between November last year and November this year, we see that the biggest increase in the trend unemployment rate was in New South Wales. Clearly, the trend in that State is the worst of all in terms of jobless in Australia. Something is clearly wrong in that economy.</PARA></TALK.START>

I do not know what has actually been going on in New South Wales, but maybe it has been slashing jobs in the public sector.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is undeniable that the figures today show that the biggest single trend upwards in unemployment over the last 12 months has been in New South Wales. As I pointed out, the retail sales figures published this week by the Bureau of Statistics show, apparently, four consecutive negative months of growth in New South Wales. But at the same time, the national figures are strongly positive; the national retail sales figures are up. In the year to October this year, the retail sales figures showed 4 per cent annual growth, which is well ahead of the figure in New South Wales and well ahead of the inflation figure in Australia. The consumer price index has recorded 0.8 per cent growth over the last 12 months, so we could say that there has been 3 per cent real growth in retail sales in Australia in the last 12 months, but that certainly is not the case in New South Wales. </PARA>

There was the November 1991 job statement&mdash;and what a misnomer that was! Unemployment kept going up and that failed. Then there was One Nation, which was a ploy brought in by the Prime Minister just before what he thought was to be the last election. He thought he was going to have a June poll, so he brought in One Nation in February. He thought how marvellously he was going to do, but then he did not have his election and the whole thing has fallen apart as the recent Estimates have shown. Then we had the 1992 Budget, and the Government has been fiddling with that and changing it recently because it has failed as well. </PARA>

We have record unemployment, record bankruptcies, a skyrocketing debt which now stands at $2 billion, and a current account deficit last month of a staggering $1.8 billion. Usually in most months the Government says, `Boy! It only went up $1 billion this month. That was a good month!' How long will it be before it starts to come down?</PARA>

Nominal interest rates have come down, but real interest rates certainly have not and  are still one of the highest. The micro-economic reform trumpeted by this Government is moving at snail's pace. The Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook, spoke in this chamber about the marvellous new changes in that rate. But before he got some of the public service involved, out in the private sector where it really counts only 3 per cent of the work force were covered. This is micro-economic reform at the end of the reform agenda that was supposed to dominate the Labor Government's fourth term. It is just a joke; it is not going anywhere at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently in the Additional Estimates we were looking at how the current policies of the Government show no hope of Australia getting out of this recession. Central to the Government's policy was the statement in the Budget about a capital works program. The sum of $345m was to be spent on that and it was supposed to create 13,000 jobs. It will not come remotely close to doing so. We talked about the example of Byron Bay where the Government spent $400,000 on footpaths but did not create one extra job. Right throughout the north coast councils revealed that they were not particularly targeting new employment and it was not creating new jobs at all. There has been a great failure by the Government in this program to put controls on what was happening, and it showed in the end that it was not creating new jobs.

We need better roads and railways to get the economic infrastructure in this country right, but because of poor planning by this Government this will not happen at all. </PARA>

We have done the calculations very carefully and these policies will create real, long term, sustainable jobs between now and the end of the decade&mdash;two million jobs, in fact. Our industrial relations reform will ensure that the current snail's pace will disappear and the antiquated rules that we currently work under in industrial relations will not stand in the way of people obtaining work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our tax changes will give people more incentive to work and the sweeping micro-economic reforms that we are proposing will take the shackles off business. Education and training policies will make sure that people have the education and skills they need to get work. Fightback stands in stark contrast to the policies of this Government, particularly the failed One Nation policies. Unemployment continues to rise in this economy and we are in an economic nosedive. Fightback is needed to create new jobs and bring us back from the brink of disaster which Mr Keating and this Labor Government have created. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the issue of unemployment on a matter introduced by Senator Hill. Unfortunately, this is a very politicised debate. It really has not been in any way an analysis of the reasons why Australia finds itself with such a high unemployment rate. There has been no comparison with the situation in many of the countries of the world which now face slower growth, such as Japan, Germany and the United States, and no examination of the impact on us. Only Asia has not been in the position that we find ourselves in. The Opposition tends to ignore the world scene that we face. Naturally enough, the Opposition is concerned with scoring political points. We know in the last 48 hours that it is fairly desperate to take the attention away from the problems it has with the somersaulting that is occurring hourly in the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, has said that the figures which have been referred to are tragic and disappointing. I certainly agree with that and my colleagues have made that clear. However, the Australian people facing this world slowdown know that Australia's rate of growth is still superior to a whole range of other economies that we can be reasonably compared with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia's present pre-election phase the Australian people also have to decide on and make a real analysis between the position this Government takes&mdash;which is a stimulatory one all the time&mdash;and the coalition's big bang, cut and burn policies. Senator Vanstone talked about the coalition's plan, but it is not really a plan. It is a policy of confrontation. I appreciate that individual senators from the other side have said that they are concerned when they are accused of being cynical about unemployment, but the objective position is that the coalition would use unemployment to reduce the standard of living of wage and salary earners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is very clear when one examines the coalition's industrial relations policy. It is designed to use the unemployment that exists to reduce the standard of living of wage and salary earners. The first part of that is manifest in the Opposition's attack on the unions. After all, the unions are the only weapon that wage and salary earners use. There is a very concerted attack on trade unions which are used by working men and women to achieve rates of pay. It is unfortunate that the coalition needs to use the despair of unemployed people in order to implement its industrial relations policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Premier Kennett in Victoria has shown just what a national coalition government would do. Senator Tierney talked about creating two million jobs, but one can see where two million jobs would come from. On the one hand we have Premier Kennett destroying jobs and the public infrastructure and reducing the standards of living of Victorians, and on the other hand, as my colleague Senator Maguire has said, we have a particular crisis or malaise in New South Wales which suffered from the assertiveness of Premier Greiner. But just as the national coalition is now facing a crisis, in New South Wales&mdash;because of the Premier Greiner's failure as a result of which he was effectively dumped&mdash;the present malaise is presided over by his replacement, Premier Fahey. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New South Wales is in that situation because it has a similar policy of reducing the public sector, reducing infrastructure and attempting to lower people's working conditions as a way of solving things. That is inhibiting the national Government's program which aims to increase the value of our human capital. We have developed the TAFE system, just to pick out one of the One Nation initiatives that is currently moving ahead to skill our work force. These measures are enabling import replacement and are successfully improving export opportunities for the manufacturing sector. To some extent, there is a reticence on behalf of the coalition in the State governments because they do not understand; they understand only cut, cut, cut. They understand only reducing the standards of ordinary people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's basic strategy, which is implicit in everything it does, is to discipline the work force, to further destroy the ability of people to spend money and to have confidence in the economy at this time of recession. We have a conflict because of the optimism of the Federal Government&mdash;based on the skilling of the work force and the structural adjustment that has taken place throughout industry in this country&mdash;the negative policies followed by Liberal State governments and, of course, the carping criticism of the coalition opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition policies in Victoria are particularly dangerous precedents to look at. What a coalition government would do to arrest unemployment is based on trying to hurt those people who are weakest in society with individual contracts. This is what the unemployed have to face when the coalition says it will create two million jobs. The two million jobs would be created in an atmosphere where ordinary people&mdash;for example women, people of ethnic backgrounds whose English is not perfect and youth&mdash;would have to fight with the unemployed in a system where people have been denied reasonable access to the fairness which they have under the award system. They will no longer have that blanket of security to ensure that they cannot be exploited as individuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Opposition says that there are certain safeguards, it forgets the fact that the decent employers&mdash;and there are so many of them&mdash;will be disadvantaged when the employer down the street undermines the system because there is no award. They will very quickly face having to reduce the standards for their people. The significance of this is that it is all very depressing. It depresses the economy. The people in such a coalition government&mdash;which is the alternative to this Government&mdash;would be depressing everybody. They would be depressing wages and standards for people in employment and they would be offering the unemployed no solution at all. That is the stark choice. That is what I wanted to refer to in the short time available. I had intended to detail the many programs in the One Nation statement and the Budget, but time restrictions will not allow me the extra five minutes needed, so I will leave that for another day. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>In speaking to the annual report of the Australian Horticultural Corporation, I wish to comment on some horticultural activities in Australia. Page 10 of the report notes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Members of the AHC represent about one third of the $3 billion dollar Australian horticultural industry. Horticulture is the third largest rural industry behind wool and beef, but is ahead of wheat, sheep, cotton and dairying. It is, therefore, not only a very significant rural industry, but also one of great importance and potential.</PARA>
<PARA>In Australia, as in most other countries, the diversity of the horticultural industry distinguishes it from most other agricultural industries. Hundreds of products grown in Australia are generally classified as horticultural products. But there are no hard and fast rules as to what constitutes a horticultural product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Production occurs under a wide range of climates, from tropical to cool-temperate. Obviously, production differences exist between product groups. For instance, most fruit and nuts are perennial crops with long production lead times, while many vegetable crops have short production cycles and require regular rotation to maintain yields. For some products the geographic dispersion and seasonal variation of production mean that different regions have dissimilar marketing requirements. For example, citrus growers in Queensland operate in different markets and at different times of the year from citrus growers in other States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the year, the AHC and industry participated in a review by the Industry Commission into the effectiveness of the Australian Horticultural Corporation. In noting the relatively short time during which the AHC has operated and other constraints in obtaining definitive statistics, the Commission reported that many of the activities in which the AHC is engaged have the potential to be beneficial to Australian horticulture and are consistent with improving its international competitiveness. The report further noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the volumes of some products such as applies, pears and grapes increased marginally during the 1980s, the production of several newer commercial crops such as macadamia nuts, avocados and mangoes increased significantly . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I was interested in that comment because at home on our property at Kingaroy we are growing avocados and mangoes. The mangoes from Far North Queensland can be harvested a lot earlier than our mangoes. We grow the Bowen special type, even though they do not come in at the same time as those from North Queensland. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Tate tasted them he would know that they are as good as the Bowen mangoes that come from the north. It is good to know that we have this wide span because it means that people can obtain these mangoes over a long period. In our local Kingaroy area there are quite a number of farms out Kumbia way which used to just grow peanuts or corn. Now, during the off-season they are growing peaches. There is even an orchard near Kingaroy that grows nashi, a fruit that is a cross between a pear and an apple.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to compliment the farmers in our area. They know the problems these days of trying to grow crops when dry land farming. People in the horticultural industry who are growing fruit must have dams. Farmers need to pump water to where it is needed and there is a cost in terms of electricity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are very fortunate at home in that we do have a dam which we can pump water from, but we cannot get enough water to cover the whole area of corn that we want to plant and the other crops. That is one of the reasons why we have diversified. Farmers trying to grow crops such as peanuts, maize and wheat have to provide the seed, the fuel, the fertiliser and the wages. The costs add up. We all know what has happened to wheat sales at present. It is a real problem to the farmers. With the costs that farmers face and with problems such as those caused by the Americans subsidising wheat through the EEP, it is no wonder that farmers have to turn to horticulture to try to get a reasonable income.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Pig Industry Policy Council has been a most effective industry organisation. The period under review has been a fairly difficult period for the pig industry. I notice that one of the prominent growers recorded a loss of $1.5m during that period. The industry is confronted with competition from imports and the importation of genetic material. The disease and quarantine issue is very important in regard to pigs, as pigs will suffer from almost any complaint known to man. The disease that has been causing most concern to the industry in the last few years is the transmissible gastroenteritis complaint. It has not been satisfactorily attended to as far as the industry is concerned. It is being held in a reasonable condition but, once the disease is installed, it cannot be totally eradicated. So it is necessary to make absolutely certain that there is no possibility of this disease getting into the country in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is the question of dumping. The pig industry has been very concerned about the attitude towards the dumping of pork in Australia by the Canadians. The Government's handling of the dumping issue is also unsatisfactory because it does not take account of the damage that can be done to an industry by the threat of dumping. It only takes a very small amount of product to come in from another country to cause a considerable lowering of price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike sheep and cattle, when pigs are ready for harvest, they have to be harvested. It is not a matter of postponing it for a week or two or a month or two, as can be done with sheep and cattle. It needs to be taken into account that the large drop in price available to Australian producers occurred more because of the threat of dumping than because of the relatively small amount of product which came in and which the Anti-Dumping Authority said did not produce material damage. It certainly did. It was a most unsatisfactory situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the year the industry was subject to various Senate inquiries&mdash;the agricultural and veterinary chemicals inquiry, the animal welfare inquiry and the dumping and countervailing inquiry. The only thing I find missing from the report, in a year when there was a lot of discussion on imports from various countries, is mention of negotiations that were going on with Denmark. There is mention made of Canada, the United Kingdom and Norway, but there is nothing on Denmark. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We understand from the communications that negotiations were dealt with during this period for the import both of live pigs and of genetic material. I was wondering whether the Council had been informed of this and, if the Council did know about it, why it did not report on it when it took so much trouble to report on other issues. I guess we will need to make further inquiries to see whether we can get that additional information. It is of relevance to the industry because of the nature of the disease question, the quarantine question and so on. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>This annual report is a comprehensive report of the FAC's operations during 1992. In the managing director's report on page 7 we are told:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Corporation is extremely conscious of its responsibilities to operate its airports in an environmentally acceptable manner. Plans are in place for all airports to review their environmental management practices during 1992/93 and to develop environmental management plans to cover all aspects of airport operation and development.</PARA>
<PARA>I hope that the FAC follows through with that eminently admirable concept and also follows through a suggestion made some 18 months or two years ago to consider planting at airports grasses that require less mowing, mowing being a great user of time, labour and energy. On page 7 we are also told:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After careful consideration of representations from staff associations, unions and others the Corporation announced that all FAC terminals would be non-smoking areas as from 1 July 1992. The response to the announcement was generally favourable.</PARA>
<PARA>I wonder why, in the light of that, the announcements that we hear over the cabin PA system in aeroplanes do not tell us that this move was made after consultations with staff associations, et cetera? Rather, they seek to blame government regulations for such a move. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This comprehensive document refers to the structure of the financial business of the FAC. On page 13 we are told:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Duty free concessions at airports represent the Corporation's largest earner, contributing one-third of its total trading revenue.</PARA>
<PARA>We are also told that aeronautical charges provided 40 per cent of the Corporation's revenue. We are given quite an amount of information about the sources of the Corporation's revenue. Under the heading `Aeronautical Charges', we are told:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the year, it was proposed to introduce from 1 January, 1993 a charge on airlines that process passengers through the Corporation's terminals, at a rate of $1.25 a passenger. It is not proposed to make any changes to the existing general or domestic landing fee rates.</PARA>
<PARA>This provides a clue as to the FAC's changed attitude. The corporation's actions in trying to operate on a commercial basis seem to move away somewhat from what I would have thought would be its charter; that is, to operate airports with safety and with consideration for the proper landing of aircraft. In my opinion, that would be a more desirable thrust for this business to be concerned with. However, here we have the FAC deciding to charge a per head rate per passenger&mdash;a sort of poll tax on airport users. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might be more appropriate to charge the airlines for their aeronautical operations, landing safety provisions and actual terminal costs. It is a most arrogant and bullying way of marketing which takes advantage of those who have no option, because passengers have no option but to catch aeroplanes at airports. It may have been more appropriate to direct attention to what it was doing; that is, providing airport facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other clue contained in this report is to be found on page 25 where, in reference to the Hobart and Cambridge airports, we are told:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A rise in passenger numbers resulted in a nominal increase in aeronautical revenues whilst the car rental business and the operation of the public car parks, upgraded with auto-pay stations, provided increased revenues.</PARA>
<PARA>That provides us with a clue that what the FAC is now directing its attention to is not operating the airports in a safe, sure and reliable manner, but rather seeking to obtain revenue wherever and in whatever manner it can be found. That is the substance of the controversial situation that we have, especially in Hobart with the inability of the FAC to come to any proper arrangement with hire car operators at that airport. In fact, it is a situation which poses a great threat to Tasmania's tourist industry. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>This 1991-92 annual report is the first report of the National Road Transport Commission which was set up by an Act of parliament that went through in the dying days of the 1991 Budget sittings. In fact, it went through on 20 December&mdash;I did not think we were here that late. The Commission was set up not to control road transport in Australia but to make  recommendations for it, especially for vehicles above 4.5 tonnes; in other words, the heavy vehicle end of the industry. The report says that the Commission is responsible for light vehicles, and it is now making recommendations but not for registration. The legislation for light vehicles, which takes in vehicles under 4 1/2 tonnes, went through only about a week ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation was proclaimed in January 1992 and the Commission was set up. This Commission is basically an independent body which reports to a council of transport Ministers from all around Australia. At times I am wary of these independent bodies set up by government, because they are generally set up in situations where they can make decisions for which the government carries no blame. However, I do not think that criticism applies to the NRTC. I believe that the Commission has been very fair in its deliberations since it has been in action, and what has come out of its deliberations has been pretty well accepted. To date the Commission has deliberated and recommended uniform charges. The Government was looking for uniform registration and charges throughout Australia, as well as conditions governing transport, speed, masses and that sort of thing. The Commission has come out with a pretty reasonable recommendation: that for an average six-axle heavy rig in Australia the charges should be around the $4,000-mark. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is well accepted in States with high registration charges but is not so well accepted by my State, which has lower registration charges. I believe that any disagreement can eventually be worked out so that we will have uniform charges and uniform traffic laws pertaining to heavy vehicles in time. I know that Western Australia is hanging out because no allowance has been made for remote areas, which will suffer from increased registration charges. Also, special vehicles have been receiving certain concessions, and that has not been addressed&mdash;at least the Western Australian Government and the Western Australian Opposition believe it has not been addressed. I believe that the concession ought to be addressed by each State individually. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New South Wales has a problem; its registration charges are going down. The New South Wales Government claims that it will not get enough road funding and therefore intends to stay with the old system. Hopefully, when these uniform registration charges are agreed to, special costs will not be added on afterwards. I believe that the New South Wales total take on registrations will not go down in the long term because vehicles that are consistently licensed in Queensland, South Australia, and even a few in Western Australia and the Northern Territory, which belong to New South Wales, will eventually re-register in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As my time is about to run out, I wish the Commission well in its future deliberations. It has some very good objectives, one of which is to raise the level of community awareness about road costs and the revenue involved. Unfortunately, it has not been charged with the responsibility to find out the total tax on the road transport industry in Australia. That is something the Government might do. It is something a Hewson government will do when elected, so that registrations will reflect total taxation of the industry, rather than just taxes on road usage and that sort of thing. </PARA>

Senator Brownhill would be interested to know that one of the things the Committee is dealing with is the encroachment of woody weeds, which we observed in Bourke. The Committee is also dealing with the overgrazing by sheep and the competition with kangaroos in the rangelands which, as you would know, Madam Acting Deputy President, is a severe problem in areas of western Queensland and the western region of New South Wales where the drought is still in existence. When Senator Brownhill and I and other members of the Committee were there earlier this year, the effect that all these particular pests are having on what was once a very successful industry&mdash;a billion dollar industry, in fact&mdash;was quite noticeable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee is involved in the biological control of weeds, such as Paterson's Curse and several species of thistles. It is also researching the redlegged earth mite. These things might not sound much but, in the overall context of keeping costs down for the woolgrowers, they are very important, as is the work the Committee is doing on footrot. Very importantly, I notice that the University of New England at Armidale has bred a flock of merinos which is resistant to sheep worms. The cost advantage of pushing that through the system in years to come will be of major benefit to our wool industry in Australia. As Senator Panizza would know, the cost of drenches is probably one of the major costs to graziers with their sheep flocks and to the developers of sheep which are resistant to worms and fly strike.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this report follows the Committee's previous report into the greenhouse effect and energy conservation, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rescue the Future</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It focuses on measures required to ensure the efforts which have been made to improve the efficiency of the electricity and gas industries are maintained, while implementing sensible measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report's major objective is to identify methods of reconciling the conflicts between economic and environmental imperatives and between Commonwealth and State priorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It also reviews the extensive changes both proposed and under way in the energy industries and draws attention to the unforseen consequences of some of these changes, particularly the repercussions of some aspects of energy industry reform for both environmental and social policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Energy industries are mostly state controlled. However, an adequate response to both the economic and environmental problems associated with the energy industries requires a national approach. The past practices of making decisions solely on the basis of regional interests have not served either state or national interests well.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's principal recommendation is that a national charter be developed for public electricity authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This charter should establish clear economic, social and environmental priorities. The report lays down ten priorities which the Committee considers should be addressed by the authorities in the next ten years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While this recommendation is specifically directed at the electricity industry, the same principles are likely to be applicable in publicly owned gas authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has recommended that in the future, governments and the authorities themselves take a broader view of their role and introduce whatever measures to reduce or control emissions which can be shown to be economic.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commonwealth government agencies should lead by example in the implementation of `no regrets' energy efficiency principles. An example of where this could be done is with regard to government buildings and public housing stock.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are a number of other significant conclusions and recommendations in this report. These include:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">. a ten year moratorium on the construction of new conventional generation plant by electricity authorities</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">. greater use of natural gas as a direct energy source and as a fuel for power generation.</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">. measures to encourage the greater application of alternative energy technologies.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are discussing, in the committee stage, the Bill introduced by Senator Walters&mdash;a Bill for an Act to regulate certain video material. I wish to understand some of the clauses a little more fully. In particular, I seek some guidance on, and wish to discuss, the application clause, which is clause 3 of the Bill. As I read it, the clause appears to concentrate on Commonwealth and Territory jurisdictions or political entities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I need to deal with a matter which I think is of importance when we are discussing a matter in the States' House, and that is the role of the States in relation to the classification of film and video material. I do so because when we met in the Senate before for the second reading debate on this particular Bill, we had not had the benefit of the meeting of the Council of Australian Governments which occurred in Perth last week. As I understand it, this Bill, because it does not in the application clause mention the States, does not, I think, take account of that important meeting, and I wonder whether Senator Walters would have wished that that be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators will be aware that at the meeting of the Heads of Government&mdash;and that is the Prime Minister, the Premiers and the Chief Ministers&mdash;a communique was issued, and if I may, I will read the relevant part, which is headed `Film and Video Classification'. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of its general concern about the level of violence in Australia, the Council considered the issue of violence on film, television and video and the value of achieving one classification system across these three forms of media.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Council noted the discussions that the Prime Minister had held with the television networks and that the networks had undertaken to draw up a draft program code that adopts the system of classification currently used for film and video. It also noted that, under the new arrangements, two new `M' classifications will replace the current wide and indiscriminate `AO' category for television with the more violent films being classified as `MA'. In relation to film and video the new `M' category will be recommended for those aged 15 and over. The new `MA' category will be restricted to those aged 15 and over unless accompanied by an adult.</PARA>
<PARA>It finishes by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Council agreed to endorse the move to two new `M' classifications and agreed to amend the relevant censorship legislation by 1 May 1993.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that it is important, because Senator Walters's Bill, of course, very properly tries to address a matter of concern to many in the Australian community, particularly parents, in relation to the M category which, I think it is universally agreed, is too broad a category. We all know that the M category could include quite unexceptionable films which just have some course language in them, ranging from that milder end way up to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Silence of the Lambs</EMPHASIS> or <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fatal Attraction</EMPHASIS>. Quite clearly, parents were confused and even those who wanted to go and see the films, whether they be children or adults, were not given sufficiently precise guidance by the M classification as to what they might expect when they sat down in the cinema or obtained the video. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that there is a universal acceptance of the need to split that category into two. I think that Senator Walters's sincerity in this matter cannot be doubted. The fact is, though, that the States, as indicated at the council of government leaders from all around Australia, believed the question of censorship and classification to be properly a Federal matter, a matter whereby traditionally classification censorship is a Federal, State and Territory matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each of the States and Territories has its own legislation dealing with these matters. Changes to the laws hitherto have come about by agreement between all the parties and it is quite clear that in Perth&mdash;and this was not available to Senator Walters when she drafted her Bill&mdash;there was unanimous agreement, as I am informed, by the Prime Minister, the Premiers and all the Chief Ministers as to a classification proposal which will have an effect on film and video that will have a flow-on and consequential effect on television programs as well. It seems all the Heads of Government certainly want more discriminating choices to be made in that M category and have put forward their endorsement of the M and MA bifurcation of that category. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also think that it is very important that the Heads of Government all agreed that that classification system should be transferred into the world of television, so that with a common classification system, once again an area of confusion can be eliminated for those who are seeking to guide particularly their children in their viewing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the elimination of the dual system is a further indication of the strength of the decisions that were taken in Perth by the Heads of Government. As I read Senator Walters's Bill&mdash;and this is not to criticise the honourable senator; perhaps she can elaborate&mdash;her legislation does not deal with that common classification matter. This was not her primary concern. I believe it is important to note that the Heads of Government decided in this way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, in relation to the split M category, the Council adopted the idea that the milder M category be recommendatory; in other words, at the milder end if parents are informed. But the stronger films and videos in the new MA category will not be available to younger children. They will be restricted to those aged 15 and over unless they are accompanied by a parent or guardian. I regard this as extremely important and a good innovation. Parents will be assisted by the law in ensuring that when their children say that they are going to see a PG or an M film in one of the big cinema complexes, they do not see a MA film. It will be an offence for a cinema proprietor to allow an unaccompanied youngster of 15 years or under to view a MA film. I believe that is important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of a parent or guardian accompanying a child into a cinema to see a MA film, the Heads of Government are saying, `It is the responsibility of the parent or guardian, and that is where the responsibility should rightly and primarily lie'. The parent or guardian who accompany the youngster into an MA film will have been forewarned and they take the responsibility. In the absence of the parent or guardian, there will be further assistance from the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this is an extremely important part of the change that has occurred. I believe it is very important that Senator Walters clarify how her Bill will work in relation to the State laws governing the classification and censorship of videos and films in their jurisdictions, particularly the enforcement&mdash;not just the classification, but the restrictive part&mdash;of the MA proposal that came out of the Heads of Government meeting. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) may know, all of the States wanted a national classification body. They did not want their own classification situation; they agreed on a national body. As the Minister would be aware, all the Attorneys-General throughout Australia met. At that stage, the then Federal Attorney-General, Mr Bowen, wanted to agree. He said that he would take back the States' desire to have a national classification body and that imported X-rated videos and films would be excluded. However, the Federal Government categorically refused to agree with the State Attorneys-General on that issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of the establishment of a national classification body has been before us for many years. I point out to Senator Tate that there is no problem at all with regard to my Bill. The States have already agreed to the establishment of a national classification body and it is that body which will look at the new classification system I am proposing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation that Senator Tate has now put before us&mdash;he said that this matter was considered at the Premiers Conference&mdash;can easily be overcome. Senator Collins's proposed amendment to the Broadcasting Bill stated what the Prime Minister wanted; that is, a common film classification system to operate across the mediums of film, video and television. The classifications will be set by the Office of Film and Literature Classification and product will bear its classification across all mediums. The classifications will be G, PG, M, MA and R. He went on to refer to broadcast for television; nothing else, just broadcast for television. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very clear that G will stay as G, PG will stay as PG, M will be divided into M and MA, and R will stay as R. There is no query at all that it will be otherwise. M, which is the milder form of the old classification M, can remain under section 5(1)(f) of my Bill which relates to `video material not recommended for viewing by persons under the age of 15 years'. The MA classification will contain material not recommended for viewing for people under the age of 18. Only a very small amendment to my Bill is needed to fit in with the Government's intention on the division of the M classification. It is not insurmountable and it is not something that cannot be done this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bearing in mind that we have only one hour, I hope the Minister will not take up, as he did a few minutes ago, 10 of his 15 minutes debating this issue.

Obviously the censor would have to make a decision on that.

There have been cases in my own State and, I think, in other States where people have got round the provision by saying, `We are not actually purchasing a sexual act'&mdash;in terms of prostitution&mdash;`by paying the money; we are actually paying for something else'.

I am raising something with her that is occurring in the Australian community. People are purchasing video cameras at a very rapid rate.

Senator Walters may think I am raising a number of matters in this Bill which are irrelevant and are a filibuster. I am sorry. For Senator Walters to complain about filibustering has to take some cheek, because over the years I have been in the Senate I have observed the honourable senator speaking for her full half hour on countless numbers of Government Bills and getting up in the committee stage debating endlessly&mdash;as is her right under Standing Orders.

In the interpretation under clause 4 the words `explicit depictions of sexual acts' have been defined in an additional way. I am looking particularly at paragraph (c).

We do not have before us the existing X classification; we have something far tighter that will have enormous ramifications. It is going to spread over to programs such as the one that I mentioned previously. That may not be the intention, but part of my problem is with the way in which this Bill is written.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is unlawful to:</PARA>

<PARA>As I understand it, because the word `or' is used, not `and/or', one could be distributing without any commercial connection. Because paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) use the word `or' and not the word `and', this could mean exactly what Senator Schacht was concerned about. One could have the distribution without any offer to sell or hire; that is, without any money involved. You would not necessarily even have to go to the extraordinary limits of charging a lot for your sausage. As I read that Bill, the point is that one could just have the distribution. Can Senator Walters make it clear to me whether or not what she said to Senator Schacht stands, when she looks at point (d) `to distribute' when there is an `or', not an `and/or'?</PARA>

Would action be taken to confiscate the material held by the person who previously distributed it? It seems to me that there is some conflict in relation to people's rights.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I was making my earlier remarks, Senator Harradine asked whether I had any further material that might be of use to the Committee from the meeting of the Council of Australian Governments, the meeting of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Premiers and the Chief Ministers. I have available&mdash;and I have provided a copy of the material to Senator Harradine&mdash;a draft document entitled `Draft classification guidelines for M and MA categories', which I understand was made available for consideration by the heads of government before the meeting in Perth. I also have available a draft ordinance for discussion purposes prepared by the Office of the ACT Parliamentary Counsel, which was also circulated to the heads of government for their deliberations before they went to Perth. I table those documents, as requested by Senator Harradine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not saying that these documents are precisely what the Heads of Government will give their assent to but, as I say, these matters were circulated to the Heads of Government and formed the basis for the unanimous communique, which I have read to honourable senators. The classifications set out in the document I have tabled deal with the categories `language', `sex', `violence' and `other'. For example, in relation to the M classification, which is recommended for mature audiences 15 years and over, the category of `other', which received the preliminary endorsement&mdash;shall we put it that way&mdash;of the Heads of Government, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Drug use may be discreetly depicted, but not in an advocatory manner. Supernatural and `horror' special effects may be depicted, but not if graphic or impactful.</PARA>
<PARA>In relation to the MA 15+ category, which is restricted to mature audiences 15 years and over unless accompanied by a parent or guardian, the `other' category is described in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Drug use may be depicted, but not in an advocatory manner. Supernatural and "horror" special effects usually warrant an `MA' classification, but not if overly graphic or impactful.</PARA>
<PARA>In any reworking of the classifications in the M category&mdash;which I think all Australians and all senators in this chamber are seeking to achieve in order to respond to proper concerns in the community&mdash;the issue of drug use is as important when considering the future of our young children as the issues of language, sex or violence. I do not criticise Senator Walters for this at all but, as I understand it, her classifications do not deal with this matter. But I find it very interesting that the Heads of Government have considered that the depiction of drug use is a matter which must be attended to by the classifying authorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that we could work in extremely well with the approach of the Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy to lowering the attractiveness of drug taking in the Australian community by ensuring here that parents know that if they say, `Yes, you can go along to an M film', drug use will certainly not be depicted in an advocatory way and that, if it is depicted at all, it will be only discreetly depicted. However, if parents sent their under 15-year-old to an MA film, they would know that drug use could be depicted, but once again not in an advocatory manner. I think this is a very interesting further development in the way in which Australian society is trying to come to terms with the very powerful influence of videos and films in the community. I commend the Heads of Government for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, it appears&mdash;and I cannot see this in Senator Walters's Bill&mdash;that the Heads of Government thought it important to look at the supernatural and horror special effects which form part of the fare of a lot of films which have, no doubt, a very strong impact on not only immature imaginations but perhaps especially immature imaginations. We have all seen horror films where the special effects are absolutely gruesome, graphic and frightening, even for adults. I remember taking a godson of mine to one of those horror films.

This is more important, perhaps, than all the law enforcement resources that we are prepared to put into that particular battle.

As Senator Tate would be well aware, the only method for the States to get this material, because of our Constitution and the fact that there is free trade between the States, is for people to apply to the ACT and get their X-rated videos from here.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992 contains a number of fairly minor amendments and a very major amendment, which was the subject of debate earlier today. The purpose of the very major amendment is to stymie the efforts of Premier Kennett in Victoria, who inherited and is attempting to rectify probably one of the worst economies this country has ever seen. This action has been described in various ways by various commentators. It was described as a `pay back Paul' action&mdash;in other words, a pay back by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to people such as John Halfpenny who assisted and supported him when he politically assassinated Mr Hawke.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, I will touch on the minor amendments. The first amendment relates to proposed new section 202. This amendment to the Act seeks to improve the current provisions permitting agreements between State and Federal unions. There is scope for Federal unions to treat as their own members of a State union and also provision for further amalgamation of unions at the Federal level. It is interesting that this Government, while talking about ILO conventions, has spent millions of dollars of taxpayers' money supporting the amalgamation of small unions and forcing them to become big unions. The threat was, `If you don't, you will no longer survive'. The ILO has subsequently found that not to be in accordance with its conventions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment to section 299 is another attempt to give the Industrial Relations Commission the power to punish people for contempt of court. This follows the loss by the Government in the High Court in the case of Nationwide News v. Wills. The court found that the Commission had the power to prevent fair criticism of its decisions or practices. The new provision is in the same terms as that used for the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. We will oppose this amendment when we come to the committee stage of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the more substantive Government amendments which appeared in the Senate chamber only today. There was no explanatory memorandum or second reading speech. This is the first time since I have been in the Parliament that we have been treated in such an arrogant way. It seems to reflect the Government's panic and agenda to rush this Bill through more for political reasons than any other reason. It is simply to satisfy the whims of the infamous Victorian Trades Hall Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are these amendments all about? They have been summed up very well by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry in its most recent review as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Government of the unions, by the unions, for the unions. If the unions want something, they get it; if they don't want something to happen then it doesn't happen".</PARA>
<PARA>When the chips are down, this Labor Government&mdash;the political arm of the trade union movement&mdash;is prepared to sacrifice productivity and employment to protect its masters, the leaders of the trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just as this Labor Government and the trade union bosses who run the show have, after 10 years, reduced Australia to almost a Third World status, approaching the white trash of Asia, so too has the pack of Labor financial vandals and the Victorian Trades Hall Council destroyed the Victorian economy. They reduced what was the financial and manufacturing centre of Australia to a basket case in a short period of 10 years. At the recent election, the people of Victoria threw those people out because Labor and the Trades Hall Council had wrecked their State. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, John Stone stated that Victoria appeared to be, quite surprisingly, the only relatively bright spot in Australia's economic future&mdash;that is, because of the reforms that were being introduced&mdash;and that Mr Keating has now moved to rub out that one relatively bright spot. He has moved to kill it off before it has even begun&mdash;the most courageous move we have seen in decades&mdash;the process of labour market deregulation which holds the principal, though of course not the only key, to becoming competitive. That is what it is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unions will not accept the democratic vote of the Victorians that they are no longer in control. The ACCI review notes that the Victorian Trades Hall Council is renowned throughout Australia for its mindless militancy and for the way it spent the last decade in stifling any attempts to improve the efficiency of Victoria's massively inefficient public sector. What the Federal arm of the unions, the Labor Government, is now doing with this legislation is helping the most backward looking union movement in Australia, and that is saying something. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government could not care less about the unemployed. We have asked question after question in the Senate this week about what this Government, which caused the unemployment and which was responsible for the biggest recession since the Depression, was doing about it. All we got from Senator Button were absolutely evasive answers, with some sort of kindergarten humour thrown in. It is not a matter to be treated so lightly. As I said, this Government could not care about the unemployed, the vacant shops or the enormous debt inherited by the Kennett Government, which, if recent reports are true, could be as high as some $3 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For years, expenditure has exceeded revenue under Labor. Labor just kept borrowing to make up the difference. How irresponsible can one be? This Government has brought in amendments to the Industrial Relations Act which, if passed by this Parliament, will, with certainty, be subject to challenge after challenge in the High Court. The lawyers will have a field day. This legislation will be challenged because it takes away the rights of the States to control their affairs. Section 51(xxv) of the Federal Constitution states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">51.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to:-</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(xxxv.)Conciliation and arbitration for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State:</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, it was always clear when this Constitution was written that the States would have certain control over their own destiny and that the Federal Government would have other controls. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Government says, `Don't worry too much about that'. I think Mr Keating himself said, `Let's not run all this democracy stuff too far'. They are not the words of a good leader; they are the words of a dictator. They are dictatorial words. The Government says, `Don't you worry about that; we will invoke the external affairs powers because of an ILO convention'. This particular piece of legislation does not relate to the external affairs powers but it does raise a lot of questions about constitutional validity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cook talks about giving workers a choice. Who does Senator Cook think he is fooling? Those people in the real world are aware of what he is saying. In the compulsory union membership closed shop the workers have the same choice as workers had in Russia and Eastern Europe before their economic systems inevitably collapsed. What Senator Cook is really saying is that by whatever means, even by the dubious use of external affairs powers, he, Prime Minister Keating and the Labor Government will protect the power of a handful of trade union bullies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cook paints an hysterical picture of employers maltreating their employees&mdash;notwithstanding the fact that 60 per cent of employees in the private sector in Victoria already work under an informal workplace program. They work under informal workplace agreements. It is the same sort of percentage throughout Australia. So the sort of untruthful hysteria we saw before the Victorian State election is now being carried over into the Federal scene. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This change in Victoria sticks in the craw of the trade unions because this is the productive sector of the Australian economy. The contractors, subcontractors and tradesmen are not only more productive but also, as a result, enjoy higher earnings. That is what the problem is. Why is it that in closed shops there is a pathological antagonism to contractors being brought on site? Anyone who has had any experience in this field will know that that is the case. Why is it that there are still signs on these closed shop sites which say `no ticket, no job'? Is that freedom? Is that the freedom that we expect in this country? The reason for it is to coerce those who do not want to pay protection money and reduce their productivity. Australians wonder why we cannot economically produce the goods that people want to buy in Australia and why it is more attractive to establish industries offshore!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said over and over again in this place that wage rates per se are not the problem in Australia. Our wages are less than half of Japanese wages. It is all to do with restrictive work practices and featherbedding forced on business in more affluent times. Those affluent times, sadly, are a thing of the past. The only way we are going to get out of the sorry mess that has been brought upon us by the actions of this Government is to work our way out of it. There is no option; there are no simple solutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As every sensible person knows, those days have long since gone. Those antediluvians in the trade unions, particularly in Victoria, either do not know what they are doing or, if they do know what they are doing, are guilty of sabotaging Australia. They have on their hands the blood of those million fellow Australians who have either lost their jobs or cannot get jobs. Why cannot those people and this Labor Government understand that by becoming more productive we will create more jobs?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an old-fashioned idea among those people. I have had discussions with them in the past and they have said to me that under no circumstances will they ever trade increases in wages for productivity increases. When I have asked them, `For goodness sake, why, in a competitive world do you take that old-fashioned view?', they say, `If we go down that route there will be fewer people employed', or, in the case of resource type industries, `It will reduce the life of the operations'. Mr Acting Deputy President, have you ever heard anything so archaic? Is it any wonder that Australia has the problems it has?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give a few examples of the hundreds of crazy work practices which have brought us to where we are and which, if allowed to continue, will destroy us. I will give only a handful of examples that have come to my notice in recent days. Firstly, a 38-hour pay week is actually a 32-hour work week. That is the common response one gets when one asks people what effect restrictive practices have on them. Secondly, painting subcontractors who go into a closed shop union site are allowed to carry only one tin of paint at a time or they are all out. </PARA>

I mentioned two examples, and I will give two other examples of what happens where there is a totally closed shop. Of course, in this respect, one of the worst industries in Australia today continues to be the building and construction industry.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tilers who have to walk over concrete laid by a union are required to wear steel-capped boots and a hard hat. Having negotiated a metre or two of laid concrete, they are free to remove the gear, which was not necessary in the first place. This has the effect of the good contractors or subcontractors refusing to go on sites to do that sort of work. We have building unions which declare a site a construction site and then collect union dues from employers for any of their employees on the site. Once they get the money, they go. It is really nothing more than the type of protection money that is more reminiscent of the mafia style operation in the United States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In answer to a dorothy dix question in this chamber the other day, Senator Cook raised an agreement offered by Copperart to its employees. He gave it as a shining example of what is already happening in Victoria. When it was pointed out to him that it was a voluntary agreement, that it was offered Australia-wide, and that the employees would be better off by around $40 a week, what happened? Senator Cook's heavy union mates in Victoria picketed the Chadstone store of Copperart and prevented staff and customers from entering that shop. That is not the way to get Australia out of its mess. It is a way to continue down the road to disaster. Is that what Senator Cook and Mr Keating mean when they say that they want to give people a choice? Some choice! The threat is: `Either do as we say, or we will destroy you'. Very regrettably, in many cases it works. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Often, I hear employers singled out for criticism. Maybe some of it is justified; I do not know. But it is very easy for people to sit in their armchairs while heavy-handed techniques are used against employers, and to then criticise employers when they give in. But in many instances, by not giving in, employers are sowing the seeds of their own destruction. They also feel very helpless in that they cannot do anything about it. I do not believe this is the sort of free, democratic society that Australia wants. Of course it is not. But it is the sort of society we will have if the unions and Labor are permitted to be above the law. That has been the major problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major concerns of the more militant unions in Australia about the coalition's Jobsback package is that it entrenches voluntary unionism. It gives people the freedom to decide whether they do or do not want to join a trade union, or any other organisation&mdash;to pick up Senator Ray's earlier interjection&mdash;whether it be lawyers, doctors or anyone else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition Fightback and Jobsback plans are about providing real jobs&mdash;jobs which have been lost because of the policies of the unelected government, the unions&mdash;and its agents here in the Labor Government. It is about giving individuals the freedom to decide whether or not they want to be in a union. It is about giving them the choice to negotiate workplace agreements with or without the union movement. I should make that very clear, because that is certainly part of the Jobsback program. It will be the choice of individuals as to whether or not they wish to have the assistance of the union movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is about increased productivity, so that more jobs are available. Without increased productivity&mdash;earlier today I mentioned the example of the coalmining industry&mdash;and while wage increases are greater than productivity, it is inevitable that we will see the continued demise of our industries. This will not happen to just the industries themselves. I know that people tend to look on these issues as being somewhat remote unless they are involved but, with the demise of industries, we get job losses&mdash;and, regrettably, those jobs get lost forever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is about improving our balance of payments so that we export more and produce more of the goods in Australia that people want to buy. It is about reducing our foreign debt, which now stands at around $9,000 for every man, woman and child. The Industry Commission pointed out in its annual report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over a million Australians are unemployed or too discouraged to look for work. The economic and social cost is enormous.</PARA>
<PARA>I see that I am about to run out of time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is difficult to know where to begin with this matter, because it has been claimed by some people that we cannot possibly be prepared to expose our position with regard to the principles that are involved in this amendment proposition. Yet, over the past year that I have had carriage of industrial relations matters on behalf of the Democrats, regular contributions to the industrial relations debate have appeared in all of our national media, from both major parties. Essentially, we have seen an exposition of the conflicting theories that have been proposed by those major parties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats have contributed to that debate. I have shared platforms in the debate with Mr Howard, I have shared platforms with Mr Laurie Ferguson and I have also contributed in media discussions, both of the type involving a couple of representatives from the other parties and also in the third-party style of media discussion where one position is given and, a few hours later, a retort is given from another position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To depict this debate as being fresh, as being a few hours old, and as requiring further detail to arrive at a conclusion, is to be dishonest, because the whole of Australia is aware that discussion is in full flight and that the positions of the major parties are well and truly being taken. A week ago, I issued a press release which set out quite clearly the position of the Democrats with regard to this aspect of the industrial relations debate. In that press release, I stated that the Democrats:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . welcomed the announcement by the Prime Minister and Senator Cook that the federal government will introduce legislation to facilitate the ability of the federal industrial relations commission to hear state cases of industrial dispute.</PARA>
<PARA>I followed that by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the first hints of the Coalition's IR program, I have consistently expressed concern that there has not been sufficient explanation of the mechanism by which minimum standards could be altered in the future. With the removal of the jurisdiction of the Victorian IRC, the only vehicle for altering basic wage rates in Victoria would be the Liberal Cabinet!</PARA>
<PARA>I have described that as a very centralised wage fixing mechanism. I also think it is a very limited and not  transparent wage fixing system. One of the advantages of our industrial relations commissions is that interested parties and those who are directly concerned present their cases in a forum which can be attended by media representatives and exposed to the public. The proceedings of the Liberal Cabinet are somewhat more restricted. My concerns in that area have not been discounted by any communications we have received subsequently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have the advantage&mdash;a dubious advantage I sometimes think&mdash;of living in the State of Tasmania which is often used as a microcosm or experimental test tube with regard to a number of practices. In the past we have been very proud of some educational initiatives which have taken place in Tasmania and have been used as models elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Tasmania in the last several months we have experienced such a program with regard to industrial relations. For the edification of listeners who are not regular subscribers to the Hobart <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS>&mdash;I suggest that might be quite a few people; but it is well read in Tasmania and it depicts the situation as it is&mdash;I will quote extensively from its editorial of 3 December this year. I apologise for the length of the quote, but it expresses the situation quite well. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Teachers, firefighters, police, prison officers and state workers under clerical awards have logic and equity on their side in their argument that they should be paid as much as their counterparts in other States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Equity and logic, however, will come at a cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority of teachers in the state schools system this week were awarded salary rises by the Tasmanian Industrial Commission to give them parity with mainland pay rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other state workers, including TAFE teachers, have signalled their intention to press for parity. They will be buoyed by the success of the teachers, and of Tasmania's nurses in 1986.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that year, the State Government, which was headed by Mr Robin Gray, joined with the nurses in a consent award to pay national standard salaries after the profession was granted substantial pay rises through the Tasmanian Industrial Commission in 1985.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nursing award is particularly ironic in the light of present events.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Concern has been expressed by the State Government that the Federal Government may devise ways of circumventing the industrial relations reforms of Tasmania and Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both Victoria and Tasmania believe that federal interference is unwarranted.</PARA>
<PARA>I presume the editorial means that the Victorian and Tasmanian governments believe that Federal interference is unwarranted. The editorial continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yet in 1986, the Tasmanian Liberal Government took the nursing salaries dispute away from the State Industrial Commission and asked for a federal ruling. It is a move which, in hindsight, it may rue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are strong arguments for providing parity with interstate wages and salaries. It takes as much effort and skill to teach in Tasmania, to police in Tasmania, and to fight fires in Tasmania, as it does in other states.</PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that such an observation is enlightening with regard to what is happening in Victoria. I apologise for referring to the metropolitan daily newspaper in Hobart, but I believe that the reporting of occurrences there can shed considerable light on what could eventuate in other States. The Tasmanian Liberal Government has decided that it will take to the Tasmanian workforce a reform agenda which is somewhat a mirror of proposals we have seen elsewhere. But, then again, we wonder whether that is the case. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury </EMPHASIS>of 8 December reports on the fruition of this policy. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Building, Construction and Maintenance Division workers have known since August their jobs would go before Christmas, and most reacted with surprising calm when the axe finally fell.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But several could not contain their indignation and made their feelings known to the management representatives.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"This is a taste of industrial relations we're going to get in the future. They're treating us like criminals.</PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that we need to look at what is happening in Tasmania, where that Department has been rendered ineffective by the State Government's actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At least the Government in Tasmania could not be accused of not having telegraphed its intentions before the State election. The Victorian Government stands accused of not having described adequately its intentions before its election. I will not purse that point; I just remark in passing that at least the Tasmanian Government gave some strong hints as to its intentions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, even though those intentions were telegraphed, we see repeated evidence of confusion which the electors have found very hard to sort out. The electors in Tasmania, who were given some indication as to the Government's policies, are still faced with confusion when it comes to their application. They are faced with this confusion because they are getting conflicting messages from both the serving Liberal Government and spokespersons for the coalition in the Federal sphere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no better example than the recent APPM dispute in Burnie. I suppose this dispute is not so recent as I first thought; it seems recent because it burns in our memories, but it happened several months ago now. I expect that most people would remember that the State Premier, Mr Ray Groom, entered the debate offering himself as a solution seeker. He was conciliatory in his approach, seeing merit in the arguments that were being presented by the unions, the workers and also the company. He offered himself as a chairperson of the dispute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, Mr John Howard suggested from afar that politicians should `butt out'. Then Dr Hewson supported the company's position and espoused the values which had been expressed by the company.

Mr Howard then met with company representatives, or at least participants in the dispute&mdash;so much for butting out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can hardly blame the Tasmanian populous for being confused about exactly where their industrial relations future lies and exactly where the policies of those people who represent the coalition will go.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may seem as though this article from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS> of Wednesday 9 December is concerned only with the precious Fightback proposal, but it also looks directly at the industrial relations aspect.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now Mr Groom, at least publicly, is strongly selling the expected benefits of the Fightback package.</PARA>

It was then a portfolio Bill which originally sought to make amendments to six Acts and make consequential technical amendments to several other Acts. Today, with these last minute amendments to directly attack the much needed industrial reforms initiated by the newly elected Kennett Liberal-National Government in Victoria, this Bill now becomes highly controversial and of major importance.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Kemp says, the Victorian Government has introduced that legislation with a mandate. It is a gross abuse of the parliamentary process to proceed with the second reading debate on these major amendments before the Opposition has been given adequate time to study, analyse and consider them. It is not possible for the Opposition to do that when only the Senate and not the House of Representatives is sitting.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It completely destroys any criticism that this Government might make of the speed with which the industrial reforms passed through the Victorian Parliament.

The communique issued at the end of Monday's Premiers Conference, now known as the Council of Australian Governments, clearly stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth confirmed that the States and Territories will be given the opportunity to examine and comment on the legislation before it was introduced.</PARA>
<PARA>Most State governments only saw this legislation when we did&mdash;early yesterday&mdash;and were given only until last night to provide comments. No-one in his right mind could regard that as an adequate and reasonable degree of consultation between the Commonwealth and the States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, the Victorian Government has had no real chance to consider the detail of the legislation. Meanwhile, the New South Wales Government has not even had the opportunity to obtain comments from its Crown Solicitor on the amendments. The New South Wales Government has formally objected to the undemocratic, unnecessary haste in having this legislation debated today. I quote from that Government's letter to Senator Cook last night:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to convey to you the New South Wales Government's concerns, not only with the general nature of the proposed amendments . . . but also with the speed at which the proposed amendments are being introduced into Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such haste severely limits both reasonable discussion of the issues involved and a full examination of the (perhaps unintended) consequences of such legislative action.</PARA>
<PARA>We know all about unintended consequences of legislation from earlier disasters that this Government has introduced. The letter goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I reiterate the New South Wales Government's strong view that the proposed legislation should not be progressed at this time to allow further reasoned debate on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA>It is typical of the arrogance of this Prime Minister, this Minister and this Federal Labor Government that they are proceeding with this legislation immediately, notwithstanding all of these objections. The new grand plan of Prime Minister Keating seeks to amend the Industrial Relations Act to encourage the Industrial Relations Commission to allow workers to move across to the Federal award system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister is ultimately seeking to alter the Act to provide access to the Federal system for workers who do not have access to a tribunal with compulsory arbitration powers; for example, the 800,000 or so Victorian workers currently paid under State awards. So we now have before us a series of fresh, highly publicised amendments to the original amending Bill which basically seek to ride roughshod over the sovereignty of States and, in particular, to subvert Victorian Premier Kennett's essential new economic reforms by providing an escape route for Victorian workers to the Federal award system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three main amendments to which the coalition is implacably opposed. The first deals with the installation of a mechanism allowing Victorian workers to move into the Federal arena and away from the Kennett legislation. The structure of this amendment to section 111 of the Industrial Relations Act presents a constitutional problem in seeking to insert a new paragraph `to facilitate access to conciliation and arbitration for the prevention and prompt settlement of industrial disputes'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not only a direct steal from section 51(35) of the Australian Constitution, but a fraudulent steal, because it conveniently&mdash;for the Government and its union masters&mdash;leaves out the key words from the Constitution, `extending beyond the limits of any one State'. This empowers the Industrial Relations Commission with an excessive degree of flexibility to which the coalition is opposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The three amendments relating to section 111 of the Industrial Relations Act, which spells out the particular powers of the Commission, are opposed outright by the coalition. The first amendment substitutes `arbitrator' for `State authority' in this subclause, which gives the bases on which the Industrial Relations Commission may dismiss a matter brought before it. One of those bases is that the matter has been dealt with by a State industrial authority. This will circumvent the role of Victoria's new Employees Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Victorian Employees Relations Commission will be made irrelevant from the Industrial Relations Commission's viewpoint because, although the Victorian Commission is an industrial authority, it is not a compulsory arbitration body. In other words, the path will be clear for the Federal Industrial Relations Commission to exercise power in relation to Victorian employees, irrespective of decisions in relation to those employees by the Victorian Employees Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second amendment to this section 111 removes, in States which have abandoned compulsory arbitration, from the Industrial Relations Commission the capacity to dismiss a matter where further proceedings are not in the public interest. Again, this is directed squarely at the new Victorian industrial relations system. In fact, it totally removes one of the major grounds on which employers can approach the Commission. The Government is placing its own political interests and the interests of union power ahead of the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third amendment fails to define what constitutes `reasonable steps' and `consultation' whereby employees can be hijacked by trade unions into the Federal system. It does not provide for it to be necessary for members of a particular union to reach agreement that they want to come under a Federal award, hence any union could override a real choice in the workplace whereby employees decided to stay out of the Federal system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final amendment to clause 6 of the Bill adds to section 308 of the Act, and is just as outrageous as the preceding ones. It compels an employer organisation to deliver notification of the resignation of any of its members&mdash;that is, any individual firms&mdash;to the Registrar of the Industrial Relations Commission and any relevant union. This blatantly provides unions with the knowledge that an employer has left the jurisdiction of the Federal system. A penalty of $500 applies if these conditions are not met within 28 days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This highlights the one-sided nature of this legislation. The amendment will maximise the opportunities for unions to rope employers back into the Federal system. The law should not give them this free kick, especially in a way which subjects employers to fines. The coalition is, therefore, absolutely opposed to the passage of this legislation. It is obvious that this Bill seeks to interfere with the free choice of Victorian workers to enter into workplace agreements free from the limitations of a centralised system of compulsory arbitration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is not only the sovereignty and jurisdiction of the Victorian Government which is threatened by this legislation. In the letter from the NSW Government to Senator Cook last night, to which I referred earlier, notwithstanding its lack of time for adequate consideration, New South Wales expressed a number of preliminary concerns about the impact of the Bill on its State&mdash;not on its supposed target, Victoria, but on New South Wales. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On any reading of the proposed changes, however, they represent an unwarranted challenge to the New South Wales Government's right to undertake effective administration of this State.</PARA>
<PARA>Among specific concerns raised by New South Wales are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Public sector chief executive service (CES) and senior executive service (SES) officers have no access to the NSW Industrial Relations Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . problems with the operation of individual CES and SES contracts are only referable to a SES grievance mediator, who has no arbitral powers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . under the proposed Federal legislation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which we are debating this evening&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">terms and conditions of employment of CES and SES officers would not be considered to be subject to compulsory arbitration or regulated by an employment agreement. Therefore, such officers could become subject to Federal award coverage. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Similarly, the Northern Territory Government has expressed concern about this legislation. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is therefore clearly within the interests of the Territory that the Commonwealth proposal be opposed as it would represent a significant loss of identity for the States and Territories. From the particular viewpoint of the Territory it would have a significant impact on the direction we might wish to take in relation to industrial relations should statehood be achieved at some later date.</PARA>
<PARA>So it can be seen that this legislation is opposed, not just by Victoria but by other States as well. The legislation is nothing more than a blatant political manoeuvre by the Prime Minister to significantly expand the Federal arbitration system. It has wide ramifications which will, therefore, be felt far beyond the immediate Victorian situation which it claims to be attempting to circumvent. I have just demonstrated how wide the concern is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation is a minefield, both for unions and for employers. If the amendments are implemented, the comfortable demarcation zone which now exists between Federal and State industrial relations systems will undoubtedly suffer fall-out. While one national system of industrial relations may suit some employers who operate as national businesses, the system would prove a nightmare for those many largely independent, but State based, operators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prime Minister Keating's recent comments that his Government's new legislation will create an opportunity for a return to industrial peace, will give recovery the best possible chance and will provide the best climate for continuing essential reform of the labour market is utter nonsense. What this legislation will do, if it is passed, is pass sentence on every Australian so that he or she is doomed to more political gamesmanship from a government that will obviously stop at nothing to remain in power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Government has no principles left with which to woo the voter. It is now totally devoid of integrity, and certainly no-one will trust it after this blatant manoeuvre which is 90 per cent political and 10 per cent industrial. These amendments represent an unprecedented extension of Federal power into State and employer responsibilities, and are an interference of the first order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation is a direct threat to the sovereignty and independence of States and, what is more, it is a threat launched by an unelected Prime Minister, heading a tired and failed government on the way out, against a newly elected Premier with a fresh mandate for reform. No wonder even Keating's mates, the few remaining Labor State Premiers, expressed reservations about this jackboot approach to the States, despite their sympathy for Labor's approach to industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At last Monday's Premiers Conference which, as I said earlier, is now called the Council of Australian Governments, the Premiers were particularly concerned about yet a further extension of the use by the Federal Government of its external affairs power under the Constitution. They are obviously not used to Prime Minister Keating's misleading statements and backflips. No wonder his media statement that the legislation would proceed immediately caused mayhem at the conference because the Premiers clearly understood that the Prime Minister had made a commitment to extended consultation through a working party which would defer the legislation until some time next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Premiers have now learnt what we in opposition have long known, and what I trust the Australian people in the lead-up to the Federal election fully understand, and that is that we cannot trust this Prime Minister. All I can say to them as individuals, as must be said to the States, is that they should be warned about the threat to their own sovereignty. It is no wonder that major employer groups have united and vowed to fight this legislation. A coalition of seven peak employer bodies, representing about 75 per cent of Victoria's 180,000 employers, has today promised court challenges and vigorous workplace action in a bid to thwart the Keating Government's attempts to circumvent the Victorian Government's reforms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Labor Government's attempts to portray itself as a saviour of workers' rights in Victoria, as a champion of employees in that State and a custodian of Victoria's economic recovery are reprehensible. The moves are grossly detrimental to the country's attempts to move forward. We are already stuck, thanks to Prime Minister Keating's Labor Government's handing to Australia over one million unemployed&mdash;and as today's figure of 11.4 per cent confirms, that number of unemployed is continuing to rise&mdash;with sluggish growth and a massive foreign debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Victorian Premier's economic and workplace reform strategies would have set the pace to drag Victorians out of their economic misery. Therefore, the steps by Labor to circumvent these proposals represent total contempt, not just for Premier Kennett and his mandate for growth, change and strength, but for all the Victorians who voted for him. No-one disputes that the previous decade of Labor government in Victoria was punished vehemently by a distressed electorate for the savage depression in which it had left all Victorians. The Victorians' wish for a fresh, unsullied government resulted in the election landslide which brought Jeff Kennett to power. His mandate is not in the least reduced by this cheap political action, first by John Halfpenny and now by the Prime Minister. Victorians do not want their Government denied manoeuvring room when dealing with their State's economic malaise. The Victorian coalition Government inherited a total economic mess, which it is attempting to set to rights. The recent posturings by the Federal Government have been set in train only to hinder and hamper that process as much as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, the recent days of industrial action in Victoria and elsewhere have been dismal failures. If Victorians believe that the Prime Minister's intervention can delay them facing the reality of their barren economy, they are seriously mistaken and completely out of touch with the disastrous nature of Labor's earlier mismanagement. If Victoria is to regain its competitive edge that Labor destroyed, create jobs and assist in the restoration of confidence and living standards, labour costs must drop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments proposed by Senator Cook seek simply to postpone these necessary reforms indefinitely. That will slow down the pace of essential economic reform. Unless labour market reforms are introduced as a matter of urgency, as Premier Kennett has sought to do, the future of this country as a serious competitor on world markets must be brought into question. Under this legislation, gone will be the steps already taken to regain that urgently needed edge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister has made a mockery of his own One Nation statement, claiming that the Government will bring back jobs and prosperity. Only this week, leading labour market expert, Professor Judy Sloan, the Director of the National Institute of Labour Studies, slated the Federal Government's industrial relations reform program as a disgrace. She has produced evidence showing that the work force has become more rather than less regulated over the past decade. She dismissed the key elements of the Labor Government's industrial reforms, saying the process of change in the Labor market was `circuitous, risky and costly'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rebutting Labor's propaganda that the labour market has become more flexible over the past decade, Professor Sloan has established that the cost of hiring labour increased from 10.3 per cent of total earnings in 1989-90 to more than 12 per cent the following year. This is a big jump in costs over a short period and does not include the cost of the superannuation guarantee charge. Professor Sloan especially attacked section 134 of the Act, under which only a certified trade union can make an enterprise agreement. With only 40 per cent of the work force unionised, the Australian people as a whole would never support this if given a direct say in the legislation. So it transpires that under this Government the system of industrial relations is flexible only as long as the powers that be agree on the terms of the flexibility. The process itself is retarding change, with only 5 per cent of the work force, or 300 agreements, having been struck under section 134. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major purpose of this legislation is to attempt to give the Labor Party some perception of political advantage by allowing it to misrepresent the industrial relations policies of the Federal Liberal and National parties by embarking on this massive, dishonest scare campaign to encourage rejection of our Jobsback policies, which are essential if we are, as I said earlier, to make this country really competitive. It is absolutely essential that that Jobsback approach be adopted and, on the other hand, that the Labor Party's attempt at political advantage not be countenanced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second purpose of the legislation, of course, is to maintain the privileged position of trade unions, and in particular union leadership, and ensure that their power is not diminished as the membership of unions declines further and further. Membership of unions is now less than 30 per cent in the private sector. On all of those grounds, it is simply not possible to support this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I join my colleagues in the views put before the Senate on a number of occasions today and say that I believe a matter of the importance of transferring in one fell swoop an enormous power over industrial relations from the sovereign States to the Commonwealth should be allowed significant debate in the Senate and significant consideration in committee. It should involve considerable consultation between the Commonwealth Government and the State governments over a significant period. It is a matter of enormous regret that with the incumbent Prime Minister (Mr Keating) this consultation and debate cannot take place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the business of politics in the 1990s, we all realise that there is an enormous imperative upon the Prime Minister to meet his own personal, grubby, short term political ends by speeding the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) through the Parliament. The more we look at what this legislation sets out to achieve, the more we come to realise that it holds within it enormous dangers for the future of Australia and for the industrial development of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that those associated with the legislation think that it is a very smart trick, that it will trip up Jeff Kennett, the Premier of Victoria, that it will stop John Halfpenny's national action, that it will stop the industrial disputes that are happening and that it will make it a little easier for the Labor Party to have some chance of winning the next Federal election. But I must say that when a Prime Minister's policy on the development of Australia, and indeed the industrial relations policy of a government, is focused not on the long term development of Australia over the next two, three, five, 10 or 50 years but on something like 10 or 12 weeks until the next election, that is when legislation deserves enormous consideration by this House of review and, of course, States House&mdash;the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation will not receive proper review. We have had a very generous agreement by the Australian Democrats to refer it to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on Monday, allowing a couple of days to give notice, I presume, to constitutional lawyers and other experts in this field to come before the Committee for a one-day hearing. That will be of assistance, but this is a matter that deserves long debate in this chamber and long consideration in committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of the debate in this chamber and all of the consultation promised by the Prime Minister was a charade. There will be no consultation; we have seen that. He promised in Perth on Monday that there would be consultation. Yet the legislation is in the chamber today and there has been no consultation. So that was another one of the Prime Minister's classic examples of saying one thing and doing the opposite. People have a term for that, but it is unparliamentary. It has been used too often in this Parliament during the week and I will not repeat it. Probably a `demonstrable untruth' is the parliamentary term to describe it under the current ruling of the President. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason why the debate here is almost sadly irrelevant is that this piece of legislation will end up in the High Court within a few months. Just as this Government's provisions to ban political broadcasting ended up in the High Court and were swept aside ignominiously by the High Court, and just as this Government's attempts to centralise corporations laws unconstitutionally were swept aside by the High Court only a couple of years ago, this Industrial Relations Bill, and these amendments we are debating tonight, will be challenged in the High Court by the States currently governed by Liberal governments. I would not be surprised to see them challenged by Labor governments, specifically the governments of Western Australia&mdash;if that is a Labor government in a couple of months time&mdash;and Queensland, which will of course be a Labor Government during the next year. We expect this law to be challenged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to spend the remaining time I have tonight suggesting to the Senate why this law is constitutionally corrupt. The short term political motives of the Prime Minister and his Industrial Relations Minister, Senator Cook, in bringing this legislation forward are disgraceful and deserve the utter contempt of the electorate and all those involved in industrial relations in any way whatsoever, be it a young Australian starting out on his or her first job, or a hardened shop steward on a factory floor. I thought John Stone put it quite well in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The terrible reality is that in Canberra today we have in The Lodge not a parliamentarian, but a dictator. With all his faults, Mr Hawke was never that.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the reality, and that is why this legislation is before us. The constitutional matters that are before us were debated at great length back in 1891 and 1897, and the years in between, when the Constitution of Australia was debated at the original constitutional conventions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter of conciliation and arbitration and whether the Federal Government should have any power at all over conciliation and arbitration were the subject of quite significant debates, mostly being a jousting match between Sir Samuel Griffith and Mr Kingston from South Australia, who was very keen to see the Federal Government have powers over industrial relations which would override the States. Over a period of six or seven years Mr Kingston actively pursed the idea of the Commonwealth having power over industrial relations matters. He was ignominiously rolled on a number of occasions and the power that the Commonwealth had in relation to industrial relations was specifically limited, as it is under section 51 (xxxv) of the Constitution, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conciliation and arbitration for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were many views put to say why the Federal Government should not have power to intervene in the industrial affairs of a State. I thought one of the more interesting quotes, going through some of them today, was when Sir Samuel Griffith looked at the ramifications of a central power having control over the industrial affairs of all the States of Australia. I thought he must have been presuming what might happen in Victoria when he considered it. On 6 April 1891, he said:</PARA>

Sir Samuel Griffith saw that if a Federal government were to impose industrial laws upon a State that hurt that State, where the State had no control over those industrial laws, and where those laws did not match the industrial conditions in those States, then industry could indeed be driven out of that State. We can imagine that happening today. It is very popular for people to say that States' rights, the notion of sovereignty in States, the notion of having decentralised decision making is no longer popular any more and that we should have decentralised decision making.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other constitutional consideration that we have before us is the reliance which we presume is upon the external affairs power&mdash;a matter which was given great debate in the constitutional debates over 100 years ago. Those who have read the constitutional debates would know that the original provision in section 51 (xxix) of the Constitution read `External affairs and treaties'. Indeed, there was great debate on whether the words `and treaties' should be included in the Constitution. The fact of the matter is that we decided to take the words `and treaties' out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation would rely on the conventions of the International Labour Organisation, the UN body on industrial relations. Again, a very distinguished founding father of Australia, the Rt Hon. G.H. Reid, on 9 September 1897, in speaking against the provision of having `and treaties' attached to the words `External affairs', said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is an expression which would be more in place in the United States Constitution, where treaties are dealt with by the President and the Senate, than in the constitution of a colony within the empire. The treaties made by her Majesty are not binding as laws on the people of the United Kingdom, and there is no penalty for disobeying them. Legislation is sometimes passed to give effect to treaties, but the treaties themselves are not laws, and indeed nations sometimes find them inconvenient, as they neglect them very seriously without involving any important legal consequences. The expression, I think, ought to be omitted. I will deal with the other suggested amendments when the time comes.</PARA>
<PARA>The point that the Rt Hon. G.H. Reid made so many years ago stands true today. I made the point in a debate in the Senate earlier this week that Australia will come to the unenviable position, or the stupid position, whereby we will not need parliaments because we will have international treaties and international organisations making all of the standards and passing all of the laws that we will be governed by. Indeed, we may as well just become part of the European Community and be governed by Brussels if we go down this stupid path. The Government has already admitted that in some respects our industrial laws do not abide by the conventions laid down by the ILO. We do not abide by them in relation to freedom of association and, as the current Minister for Industrial Relations points out, we do not abide by them in relation to the right to strike. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, my view&mdash;and it is not a particularly well-informed view&mdash;is that under section 51 there are a number of provisions giving the Federal Parliament power to make laws in relation to a number of aspects. I would argue that the external affairs power has had far too broad a reading by the High Court judges in the past 10 years and that it has been an absolute bastardisation of the intent of that power to apply it in a number of areas where it has been applied in the last 10 years, and certainly in relation to this area. The Constitution has quite explicitly said that the Federal Government has power to make laws in industrial relations by specifying, as it does, in section 51 (xxxv) of the Constitution:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conciliation and arbitration for the prevention and settlement of disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State:</PARA>
<PARA>That is a quite express power which is given to the Federal Parliament and this legislation goes well and truly beyond it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Government seeks to rely on that power, this legislation will be unconstitutional. If it seeks to hunt around for another head of power and chooses external affairs, I put it to the Senate that the Constitution, under section 51(xxxv), limits the power of the Federal Government in relation to industrial relations, and the Government cannot then seek to read another head of power more broadly to give itself that power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I predict quite confidently that this legislation will be struck down by the High Court. I plead with the Australian Democrats to consider carefully whether or not they will go along again with this Federal Government's short term political plot to pass this legislation. It is the same short term political plot that it had in respect of the political broadcast legislation and the corporations law only a couple of years ago. It went to the great expense of passing these laws and then to the further great expense of having them considered by the High Court and being ignominiously thrown out by the High Court when they were proved to be wrong, as they are clearly obviously wrong, and not based on any clear constitutional foundation. I deplore the legislation and I urge the Senate to defeat it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Having heard Senator Macdonald's remarks, I am reminded of the statement which applies to the front bench of the Labor Party: `No ticket, no front bench'. The reality, as we know, is that the trade union movement controls this Labor Party. This is demonstrated no more clearly than in the amendments to the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The union movement&mdash;the John Halfpennys, the Bill Keltys and all those people who have had the interests of the Australian workers at heart over the last 10 years, when average earnings have been cut and one million unemployed have been created&mdash;has told the Keating Government that the industrial reforms which are occurring in Victoria must be stopped. This Labor Government and the ACTU do not want any checks or balances which might interfere with their powers, their privileges and their view of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no question that these reforms threaten the current system of trade unionism in this country. If the Kennett reforms are allowed to continue, as they will, we will see the development of an industrial relations system which empowers individual workers and ends union monopolies. What was so terrible about the Victorian reforms which so horrified Mr Halfpenny, Mr Kelty, Senator Ray and all those characters who are so closely associated with union power in this country? What was so appalling about it all?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will summarise these reforms. Firstly, the Kennett reforms enable employers and their employees to negotiate enterprise agreements on an individual or collective basis. What a terrible thing it is that Australian workers want to get out and talk with their bosses and between themselves to work out a cooperative agreement to their mutual benefit! That was the first aspect of the Kennett reforms which caused such shock and horror in Trades Hall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the Kennett reforms will make union membership voluntary and a matter for individual choice. What a terrible thing it is that Australian workers can decide whether they want to join a trade union! No more will we see the signs up on the building sites, `No ticket, no start'. That means that the trade unions will have to go out and work hard to recruit members and to make sure they serve the interests of those members. But voluntary unionism is the kiss of death to the sort of unionism that Senator Ray, John Halfpenny and their mates wish to have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third thing the Kennett reforms set out to do was to make secret ballots compulsory before any industrial action such as strikes or work bans is taken. Imagine workers being given a choice as to whether they wish to go on strike. It will not be a matter of John Halfpenny saying, `Everybody out', and out they all go; John Halfpenny will have to go out and convince workers in Victoria to go on strike. There will be a secret ballot&mdash;no more union bully boys&mdash;through which the individual worker can decide whether he wants to go on strike. That is heresy as far as the trade union movement in this country is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth thing which really worried the trade union movement was that the Kennett reforms provide flexibility in the working hours of Victorian awards by allowing ordinary working time to be worked in any five consecutive days. It is a very important reform and, among other things, one which will be of great benefit to women. But this flexibility just cannot be allowed!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with these four principles is that there is one thing they do not require: the intervention of the trade union bosses&mdash;the Bill Keltys and the John Halfpennys; under the Kennett reforms they will have a far quieter life. These Kennett reforms have to be defeated at all costs, because with them Australia will not be the country that we are used to it being. It will not be a country with 11.3 per cent unemployment, one million unemployed and falling real wages; we will not have an Australia in which the power of the union bosses remains entrenched. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party is the political arm of the trade union movement. Senator Ray, a very senior member of the Labor Party, will confirm this. If Bill Kelty says `Jump', Senator Cook, Senator Ray and Mr Keating say `How high?'. And how high is the jump required with these amendments? Any constitutional law or mandate of a democratically elected government can be overturned to preserve union privileges. This is what it is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that one of the great distortions in political life in this country is the control of one of our major parties by a special interest group with very strong vested interests&mdash;the trade union movement. This has had profound effects on the workings of our democracy and the workings of our economy. A classic case which we are seeing now is that, where the interests of the ordinary workers conflict with the interests of the union bosses, the union bosses will always support the Labor Party. Their main aim is to get Keating back into office at any cost, because without Keating there will be no more power, no more privileges and no more special jobs for the union bosses. Hence, this is one of the great distortions in the political life of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Questions of the links between trade union movements and major political parties have largely been resolved in western Europe. This is a major matter for public debate in the United Kingdom because the Labour Party is seeing what a gross distortion it is to give such power to unelected union officials. As I said, the prime concern of union bosses is to entrench their government in power so as to protect their rights and their privileges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Keating-Kelty Government in effect has been running this country for almost a decade. What has this magnificent industrial relations system, which Mr Kelty and Mr Keating put together&mdash;this great accord&mdash;produced for Australia? First, it has produced falling living standards. Even Senator Button indicated in this chamber today that average real earnings had fallen during the term of this Government. This is a Labor government whose stated intention is to try to protect the living standards of ordinary Australian workers. Yet it has cut them. That is the first thing that this magnificent industrial relations system has produced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the industrial relations system has produced the inevitable consequence: miserable productivity and, hence, the prospect of further falls in living standards. The third great feature of the industrial relations system, the accord, which Senator Ray, Mr Kelty and Mr Keating have supported, is one million unemployed. Today we saw the figures that indicate that in no other period in Australian history have more Australians who wish to work not been able to find work. This is the record of the Labor industrial relations system. What a fantastic record!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is one of the most significant Bills to come before this Parliament for a long time. Firstly, it seeks to extend massively the reach of the Federal arbitration system. That is its intention, but I suggest that it has far wider implications for this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue is that the Bill is a blatant attack on the States. This Bill destroys any notion of cooperative federalism in this country. Who will cooperate with the constitutional gangster, Paul Keating? Very few States, I suggest. The third issue this Bill brings before this chamber is that it undermines the nature of our democracy. As my colleague Senator Macdonald pointed out, when questioned on the Channel 9 <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program about the Government's intention&mdash;and Senator Ray will remember this&mdash;Mr Keating said, `Let's not run too far on all this democracy stuff'. </PARA>

He will compromise any principle to stay on that front bench. I suggest to him that he does not serve his Party well, nor does he serve this country well, in the weakness he has shown over the years.

That policy, as Senator Ray can confirm, was the major issue in the State election campaign.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is some irony in the fact that this Bill seeks to further use the Industrial Relations Commission for political purposes. You may recall, Mr Acting Deputy President, that in this chamber today and yesterday Senator Cook extolled the virtues of what he described as our `independent arbitration system'. It is interesting to reflect on the attitudes that Mr Keating, Mr Kelty and Senator Cook have had over the last year and a half towards the Industrial Relations Commission in this country. Over a prolonged period they have engaged in personal invective in order to belittle this institution. As Senator Ray can confirm, they have put in place a number of Acts of parliament to alter systematically both the Commission's powers and membership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time as the Government-ACTU attack on the system of conciliation and arbitration was continuing, the Labor Party was also moving to ensure that the members of the Commission were brought more into line with the intellectual approach that the Keltys and Keatings of this world have. There was an old joke that Senator Ray may have heard. It is not a great joke, but it tells a nice story. Why is Bill Kelty so angry? Because Justice Maddern can still create a Full Bench without an ACTU officer on it. Is that not a terrible thing?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is that the Government and the ACTU have installed so many members of the Commission who have had a close association the ACTU that it is almost impossible not to have a former ACTU officer on any Full Bench. More Deputy President jobs have been created to allow for the appointment of those who may be more intellectually bound by the sort of philosophy embodied in the accord, the sort of philosophy which has led to the economic crisis that this country now faces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given their less than honourable approach to the Commission, it is a major step in hypocrisy for Senator Cook to say that the Commission is an important institution in this country. What did the President of the Commission, Mr Barry Maddern, say yesterday in his annual report? He attacked the Government for its policies towards the Commission. He felt that those sorts of policies could create the perception that the independence and integrity of the Commission were being undermined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one knows where this matter will end. In my view, this Bill will be found to be unconstitutional. It will be a great pity if the Australian Democrats continue to support Bills that come before this Parliament and are later found to be unconstitutional. Senator Powell, who is now in the chamber, will recall the very strong support that she, as the then Leader of the Australian Democrats, gave to the political advertising Bill.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are reminded, once again, that the Australian Labor Party is but the political wing of the trade union movement. Today we are seeing that political wing doing the trades unions' bidding and attempting on this occasion to extend the power of the trade union movement to override the concept of States rights, to abuse the use of the external affairs power and to make the power of the unions stretch far more tightly over non-union members than it has ever done hitherto.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This quite remarkable piece of legislation has been hastily cobbled together. We have only just received the explanatory memorandum. Indeed, we had to argue fast and furiously this morning that the Senate was entitled to see the explanatory memorandum before we commenced on the second reading debate. As I said this morning, it is a ridiculous proposition to actually speak to the second reading of a Bill when we have not seen properly all the documentation that pertains to that Bill. We might just as well stand up in the Senate and debate broad-based motions of principle. We are looking very closely at the Bill, even at the second reading stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that when we look at the supplementary explanatory memorandum, which we finally received, we find that the threat by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) early on in the piece that he would use the external affairs power of the Commonwealth Constitution to bring the State industrial relations system in Victoria within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth is attempting to be fulfilled. The coalition is quite obviously opposed to the abuse of the external affairs power in this way. Quite clearly, section 51(xxix), which gives power to the Commonwealth to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to external affairs, had an entirely different concept when it was included in the Constitution from the one to which this Government is trying to extend it today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite interesting to observe that a Minister in this Government, Senator Evans, when wearing his hat as a legal commentator of some sort or another, wrote a piece called `Australia's Constitution: time for change'. In that article, which related to this question of the external affairs power, Senator Evans wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . much will depend on how the High Court applied the test enunciated in general terms in the 1982 Koowarta case, namely that the Commonwealth is entitled to legislate on reliance on the s.51(xxix) external affairs power when the subject matter is such that failure to so act would put Australia's international standing or reputation at risk.</PARA>
<PARA>Australia's international reputation is in no way at risk. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was referring to Senator Evans's treatise concerning the Koowarta case and indeed his assessment of when the external affairs power can be invoked. Senator Evans's interpretation of the Koowarta case and when the external affairs power can be invoked was expressed in this article which he wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . when the subject matter is such that failure to so act would put Australia's international standing or reputation at risk.</PARA>
<PARA>Australia's international reputation, as a result of the Kennett reforms in Victoria, is clearly not at risk. Indeed, one could say that that legislation has enhanced the freedom of individuals to negotiate their own relationships with employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For Senator Evans to have any consistency at all, presumably he must maintain the view that somehow Australia's international relationships are at risk in this area, otherwise there would be no justification for using the external affairs power. In fairness to him, he did write that piece prior to the Tasmanian dams case; but he was obviously well aware of the fetter that was placed upon the power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interpretation of this power was, as I said, dealt with further in the dams case and expanded in Richardson and the Forestry Commission. The qualification mentioned was outlined clearly by Brennan and Dean in the dams case. They stated that the law must be in faithful pursuit of the convention or the treaty. I question whether the law that we are attempting to enact today is in faithful pursuit of the international treaties which the Government is presumably relying upon when these very treaties may guarantee voluntary unionism in the same way as has been enacted by the Kennett Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, it is coalition policy to ensure that we see an end to compulsory unionism and that we see true voluntary unionism. That means that people are just as free not to join a union as they are free to join. Quite clearly, the power which is set out in the external affairs power was certainly not meant to cover this sort of case. It can be described quite properly as an abuse of the power and no doubt will be finally determined as such by a High Court challenge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the actual content of the amendments. According to the explanatory memorandum to the Bill, the proposed new subclause 3A provides a new object for the Industrial Relations Commission&mdash;that is, to interfere in the proper jurisdiction of the States, and Victoria in particular, in the area of labour relations. Its language is contorted; it uses the double negative. It states that its amendments will guide the AIRC in exercising its discretion under the Act relating to conciliation and arbitration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, it uses the precise words out of the section of the Constitution dealing with conciliation and arbitration; but of course it leaves out the most important words which were mentioned earlier in the day by Senator Parer&mdash;that the power is to be invoked only when there is an interstate conflict. But this is of no concern to the drafters of this Bill or those who wish to ensure that union power is allowed to be extended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than guiding the Commission, the amendments place an obligation upon it to consider cases which it otherwise may agree not to consider in the public interest. The court is told specifically that it may not consider the public interest&mdash;some Act of parliament which says that. I use the word `court' in a very loose way because it is not a court. Indeed, that section of the legislation which we examined earlier and which attempts to give contempt powers equal to a court is again trying to make the Commission look as if it is a court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, the proposed new subsection 111(1A) will force the Commission to consider the relations of employers and employees in States which do not have Federal awards applying to them, are not subject to voluntary agreement arrangements, and are not subject to compulsory arbitration under State law. This means that in a State such as Victoria the necessary micro-economic reform which is currently being introduced by the Kennett Government in the labour market will be thwarted by an enactment of the Commonwealth Government. In the State which is suffering the most in the worst recession in 60 years, the Prime Minister will not allow the necessary reforms to be introduced to enable Victoria to bring itself out of recession. This is a State which has just thrown out a Labor government which penalised that State for 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We remember that John Cain called an election in such a way as to prevent the exposure of much of the corruption that finally became evident and had been going on in Victoria prior to that election and then prior to Mrs Kirner being dumped. This was a democratic election which saw much discussion and advertising concerning industrial relations. Yet this Federal Government, acting as it is as the political wing of the trade union movement, has a power lust. It is making a grab for power to try to entrench that union power before it loses government federally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is only possible, at the end of the day, because of the complicity of the Australian Democrats. I think it is important to note and, indeed, to repeat the quote that my colleague Senator Kemp used when he talked about the founder of the Democrats, Senator Chipp, imploring those people who were the inheritors of his work not to vote for such atrocious legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important to remember that what this Government is doing is turning the Commission into a contrivance by the Government to regulate the labour market for its own ends and for its own constituency&mdash;the trade union movement, which is on the decline and wishes to rope in those people who are presently outside its dictatorial powers to ensure that it is able to gather in additional money to fund its own campaigns. But, more particularly, it is so that its own trade union officials&mdash;the bully boys; the graduates of the John Halfpenny school of industrial relations&mdash;can show us once again the ugly face of the trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But well we should remember that the Commission is just that&mdash;a commission, not a court. When Chief Justice Mason dealt with the previous attempt by this Government to stop people speaking in a free way about the lacklustre performance of the Industrial Relations Commission when that legislation was struck down in Nationwide News Pty Ltd v. Wills, he had this to say, `The Commission does not have the standing and status in the public mind which the court system enjoys. It was not meant to, nor should it'. This whole attempt to elevate the sort of people whom Senator Kemp described earlier&mdash;the mates of the trade union movement&mdash;to higher and more powerful positions in the land is just not on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the Parliament should take cognisance of the views of the Chief Justice in this respect and resist attempts to invest the Industrial Relations Commission with the contempt powers of the court. More particularly, at the end of the day the Democrats should, at the very least, see the abuse of the external affairs power and the abuse of the grab and lust for power by the trade union movement through its political wing&mdash;the current Labor Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a sad and sorry day when we see this sort of legislation being rammed through the Parliament. I understand that it will take until 3 o'clock tomorrow morning for this to be done because the Government is so insistent&mdash;Mr Keating made a promise that he would force through this legislation. So we will have less debate than we ought to have and there will be less scrutiny than there ought to be. But at least we have had some breakthroughs in that we will be able to have some investigation of the Bill a little later in the week. But the speeches at the second reading stage are being curtailed and, for that reason, I will curtail my own remarks at this point. </PARA>

Earlier in the debate and earlier today, in some other debates surrounding this legislation, allegations were made that somehow or other I had some special access to this Bill and that it was for that reason that I was able to circulate today quite substantial amendments to this Bill. That is, of course, garbage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill was introduced on 15 October. I was capable, therefore, of giving instructions for the drafting of amendments which were circulated today. That was not beyond my wit. I suppose I should not find it too extraordinary that the Opposition seems to have lost the plot somewhere for the original Bill. Certainly, we have subsequently had significant amendments put forward by the Government. I just want to make it clear that my own amendments are on the basis of a Bill that was introduced back in October. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support what the Government intends doing in this Bill and particularly by way of its amendments; that is, to improve access to Federal awards for people presently under State awards in certain circumstances. Tonight, however, I will confine my remarks to my concern for women both under the new industrial laws in Victoria which have been passed and which will come into operation fully over time and under the proposed industrial relations regime of a possible Federal coalition government. As several others have said, we do not have a lot of time for the debate. I would like to make many other points but I will confine myself to my concern about the effects on women. It is for this as much as any other reason that I support the Government's move. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor McCallum, Associate Professor of Labour Law at Monash University and who was, like me, a participant in the day of action in Victoria on 10 November, has had something to say on this matter. He has made the point that he believes, as I do, that `women are the ones who will bear the brunt of the pain of the Victorian State Government's industrial relations reforms'. He has also expressed some frustration that this point has not been made strongly enough, loudly enough nor often enough in the debate which has ensued since the change of government in Victoria. That is not necessarily because nobody agrees with him and nobody is concerned about this issue; it is often difficult to have concerns relating to women gain the public voice that they deserve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is somewhat encouraging to hear from the Victorian Trades Hall Council that there has been quite a surge by women towards joining unions since the Victorian State election. I certainly welcome that. I think they will need the sort of protection that they will get from the unions. In many cases women have not been members of unions because they have not found them relevant. I myself have criticised the fact that unions have not met the challenge sufficiently over the years to attract women to membership. Of course, what the unions have not been able to do in their recruitment of women for union membership Jeff Kennett has been able to do. It is about the only thing I can think of that he has ever been able to do for women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note that the legislation in Victoria does not mention equal pay. Because equal pay provisions are included in awards and not in legislation, this fundamental aspect that must be of concern to all women is at risk. Once again, women will be placed in the position of having to fight for wage parity as part of the process of individual employment contracts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Jan Wade, the Victorian Attorney-General and Minister responsible for Women's Affairs, takes a contrary view. She says that she does not think there is any evidence that there will be adverse effects on women. She has also used the example of New Zealand, where she claims that a freer labour market:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . has been quite advantageous because women are in growth areas. They've had an opportunity to negotiate conditions that suit them.</PARA>
<PARA>I have a paper from New Zealand&mdash;a country to which I have travelled three times in the last 12 months or so&mdash;which was given by Linda Hill, from the Sociology Department of the University of Canterbury, to the Women's Studies Conference in September this year. She takes a contrary view from Mrs Wade and she is in New Zealand. At the time of this conference, the Employment Contracts Act, the New Zealand legislation, was well over a year old. The legislation had its first anniversary in May 1992. The conclusion of that paper reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ECA is affecting women disproportionately because of the larger numbers of women than of men work in scattered, industrially weak situations.</PARA>
<PARA>The paper at this point mentions that there are many male dominated, low skill, low paid occupations which are having similar problems. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the name of flexibility, the ECA is impacting most heavily on those whose hours, employment and job content are often already flexible. To lower overall labour costs, the ECA attacks the weakest sections of the labour market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The likely consequences of the labour relations changes of the ECA are not only increased individual disadvantage for women at work, not only increased negotiating disadvantage for their unions, but increasing inequality for women in NZ society as a whole. If paid work is the route to independence and social status in our capitalist and patriarchal society, then the ECA undermines the very choice, freedom and equality that its language celebrates.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a contrary view from New Zealand which perhaps I should pass on to Mrs Wade. It is important to note that the new Victorian legislation goes further than the New Zealand laws; a matter which Professor McCallum has noted. In New Zealand there is still the right to strike and workers have access to a labour court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Victoria, one in two female workers are under State awards compared with one in four male workers. The fact is that most of these State awards are in low paid occupations. There are historical reasons for this. Traditionally, Victoria has had quite an undeveloped industrial relations system. Victoria did not have an Industrial Relations Commission until 1981. Since the 1890s the tradition had been wages boards. Unions were not represented on these boards. This meant that unions with clout&mdash;such as the transport and communications unions, most of them male dominated&mdash;moved to the Federal sphere where they could strike better deals for their members. As a result, Victoria has the highest percentage of workers on Federal awards of any State. The unions that remained under the State system were those in which unskilled and low paid workers predominated&mdash;shop assistants, clerks, cleaners, waitresses, barmaids and so on. Now we are getting a picture as to why it is important for many people under these awards to be able to move into the Federal system. That is what this legislation will allow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor McCallum has also made the point that, in his view, it is the `women who will now feel the chill winds of a "free" labour market', in the same way as the New Zealand paper I have referred to points out. Many of these workers are in situations where, even should they be brave enough to do so under the new legislation, strikes are difficult to organise. Of course, they are now faced with the situation where they will be dependent on their employers' agreement for retention of award situations. The workers are in a `take it or leave it' situation or, as Peter Boyle, the President of the Australian Small Business Association, has said, beggars can't be choosers. As I say, employees are very much dependent on employer cooperation and agreement to be able to stay within awards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lack of regulation under the system in Victoria will increase the differential between men's and women's wages. This concern has been raised by the Industrial Relations Commission itself even under the Labor Party's enterprise bargaining system. In this chamber I have expressed my concerns about how women are faring and will fare under that system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the prospects under the system in Victoria are much worse. The employee relations legislation in Victoria, for instance, does not allow for sick leave to be cumulative. Many women who use that cumulative situation, not just to cover their own illnesses but to cover the care of their children or others in their family as they maintain the traditional caring role, have the right to be very concerned about that. The very punitive aspect of the Victorian legislation is of enormous concern. We could push labour costs down and down in this country, but that will not increase confidence or investment in this country, nor will it produce jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, there have been reports of increased inquiries by women for union protection in Victoria. I find that a rather encouraging situation. I personally know many women who previously felt no need at all to get `that political', as they have often said to me&mdash;meaning political enough to join a union&mdash;but who now have a quite different view. These include quite young women who, to this point, have taken for granted not only the benefits and advantages that they find in their working situation, but the general benefits and advantages that they have through the advancement of women, that advancement having been contributed to by the organised labour movement through this past century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important to say a few words here about the similarity between what is happening in Victoria and the prospects under the Federal coalition's policy. In fact, the industrial relations system that we have had in this country in many ways has performed for women. Although there is still a wage differential between men and women in this country, and although Australian women's hourly earnings are about 83 per cent of men's, we are ahead of women in many similar economies. We are ahead of the US, Canada, the UK, Belgium, Holland, Germany and New Zealand, for instance. That situation is at risk under the industrial relations system put before us, and under the one in place in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Money is not everything and, for women in particular, the issue of flexibility is important. It is true that the male dominated centralised system which has been a large part of our heritage has not performed well on that score. When Mr Howard, as industrial relations spokesperson, promotes his policy, flexibility is, and will be, a major selling point. It all sounds rather wonderful: a woman going in and negotiating flexibility with her boss. But how realistic is it really?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a question Adele Horin asked in an article last Tuesday in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>. It is an extremely valid question. Those women who work in the areas I mentioned before, particularly in Victoria under the State based award system&mdash;women in clothing, food processing and retailing&mdash;lack bargaining power at the best of times, and, as Adele Horin said in her article, these are the worst of times. Some women will do well, but the bulk of women will not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the enterprise bargaining system of the Labor Government and the ACTU has a question mark over it as well. Under the coalition, women will be dependent on being able to reach an agreement with their employers. Even if they can get agreement to stay on the award, there is no mechanism for changing the award to take account of inflation or any other processes that currently exist. Over time, the award system is bound to wither away. I take encouragement from the fact that this Government is prepared to act to assist in protecting women particularly, but all workers in positions of less influence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">About a month ago, in an address to the Home Economics Association, a Melbourne University historian, Dr Janet McCalman, spoke of the momentous changes in our cultural heritage over the past 200 years. I quote from her speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you review the rise in domestic standards during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, you find that it is chronologically determined by the advances fought for and won by the trade union movement. First the right to combine; second the right to strike; then the right to picket; the necessity for compulsory unionism, without which strike action can be suicidal. Politics is about power and the only power and bargaining weapon the poor have is the withdrawal of their labour; and if employers can quickly find alternative labour, then industrial action is useless. The right to combine and to strike has done more for our basic decencies of civilised life than the right to vote. No-one gave the poor higher wages, safer workplaces, holidays, sick leave and controlled hours out of the kindness of their heart. It has been a painstaking and painful struggle.</PARA>

I propose the repeal of sections 45D and E of the Trade Practices Act. The repeal of those provisions is ALP policy and ACTU policy. In 1978 the Trade Practices Commission itself expressed its position in relation to instituting proceedings under 45D and made the point that the Commission `would propose to limit court proceedings it might bring to cases affecting competition'. It went on to make the point that, basically, it considers this an inappropriate application within its own purview.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened with interest to Senator Bell's contribution on behalf of the Australian Democrats. He said that it is hard to know where to begin. That is quite in keeping with the Democrats, because quite often they find it hard to know when and where to finish as well. I do not find it hard to begin because the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992 deals with one of the most important issues facing Australia today, and that issue is industrial relations reform. I stress the word `reform', because that is what we need. Our current industrial relations system is holding us back from climbing out of the deepest recession we have had for 60 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot believe that at a time when we need to do everything possible to get people into work, Australian workers are unable to negotiate contracts that would enable businesses they work for to keep going and some workers are asking for improved awards and conditions under these circumstances. I want to say right from the beginning that I, like the shadow Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook), believe in the right of unions to exist and the fundamental right to strike. What I do not believe in is unions single-mindedly pushing their own barrow without regard to fellow workers or the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Things have to change. People should be allowed to negotiate with their employer if they wish. People should not be forced to join a union against their will; they should be given a choice. They should also have the choice to stay in their current award or have the union negotiate on their behalf. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know why the Government is so upset about the changes which are proposed in Jobsback. If unions are doing their job, and if people want to belong, they will stay members of the union and appoint the unions to negotiate on their behalf. Of course, if unions are not doing their job, people will resign from them. The good and effective unions will keep their members; the ineffective unions will not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is exactly what has happened across the Tasman in New Zealand. In October, I referred to a resolution by a majority of the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions against pressing for a return to compulsory unionism. Amongst those unions which voted for this cooperation was the engineers union, which is the equivalent of the Australian Metal Workers Union. An article about this titled `Union pragmatism triumphs in NZ', which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper on 12 October, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Contrary to the dire predictions of employers and unions wedded to the centralised system, the New Zealand experience has shown that workplace coverage has not suddenly been fragmented as a result of open competition for workforce representation . . . despite the new framework, unions have found it relatively easy to retain coverage&mdash;provided they work for it, that is.</PARA>
<PARA>I have also referred in this chamber to the positive effect of the industrial relations system in New Zealand. In October this year, the international food conglomerate H.J. Heinz bought Wattie Industries for $428m. Again I quote from the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's quite clear that the Heinz hierarchy reckoned that New Zealand was a better place in which to bed down all that money than Australia, particularly because it had exporting into the Asian food market in mind.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet day after day the Minister for Industrial Relations sings the praises of his industrial relations system where workers lose their jobs so their colleagues can get pay rises. This is the system where employers are forced to give workers benefits they cannot afford, where businesses close because they cannot afford to pay pay rises that are demanded by unions, and where union members strike for awards and conditions that their employers and the nation cannot afford at this time. The question is whether we want to continue with the current system which, without a doubt, has contributed to our current economic crisis. Or do we want to move ahead to a system where both workers and employers have more say in the running of their own lives?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just last week, rail workers employed by Australian National on South Australia's Eyre Peninsula had a 24-hour strike. Members of the Australian Railways Union are asking for a 10.5 per cent increase over eight months. They have rejected AN's generous offer of 4.5 per cent over 12 months, and they still have not ruled out further strike action. How can Railways Union members ask for a 10.5 per cent pay rise in the middle of the worst recession for 60 years? How can they ask for a pay rise when the average broadacre farmer who they were servicing in this area, who sends his grain to market by rail, is predicted to make a loss this year of $25,000?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to know whether these union members have considered that any increase in their union wages will be passed on in the form of higher freight costs to the people who can least afford it&mdash;the primary producers in those areas. I am astounded that rail workers could ask for a pay rise and go on strike when they know full well that the harvest has just begun on Eyre Peninsula and that farmers rely on rail for three-quarters of their transport to the grain terminals. Because of the unseasonal weather, it is even more important than ever to get grain from the silos to the terminals as quickly as possible. The last thing that our grain producers need in this current predicament is tonnes of grain getting wet and deteriorating before it gets to the terminal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that Australian National has restructured and is a vastly more efficient service than it has been in the past, but is this the best we can do? What does it say for community spirit and understanding when rail workers not only ask for pay rises our farmers can only dream of but also jeopardise their harvest by going on strike at such a crucial time? The Australian Railways Union in this area is out of touch, both with the reality of the Australian economy and with what the community wants. The centralised wage system is also out of touch with the economy and with what the community expects at a time of deep recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This brings me to the policies that have been outlined in Jobsback. I believe that this is what the community wants, but the policy is not being given a fair go. As with the GST, this Government is scaremongering about our industrial relations policy, particularly on the issue of protection for workers. Protection is a very important issue, and the coalition has thought about this seriously. Whilst we recognise the rights of workers not to join a union, we also recognise that non-union members have a right to be protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government is very fond of saying that Jobsback will return us to the dim dark ages of industrial relations. This has not happened in New Zealand, and there is no evidence to suggest that it would happen here. The reason it will not happen is simple: the policy in Jobsback protects workers. I know that the Government and the unions do not want to believe this because it does not suit them. They want to be able to say that workers will be exploited under the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the record&mdash;and so that no Labor senator with a clear conscience can state in this chamber that our policy will not protect workers&mdash;I will outline three important measures contained in the policy. Firstly, if employers and employees make a joint decision prior to the birthday of an award to stay in the current system, that is what happens. In this situation, nothing changes. I repeat: if they decide to stay jointly in the award, that is what happens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, where either the employer or the employee does not want to stay in the current system and has not reached a workplace agreement by the birthday of the award, the current award wages and legal conditions remain as a contract until such time as both parties agree to vary it. It is not true that if the employer wants to get out of the award system but the employees do not, the employer's wishes prevail. If the employees do not want to leave the award system, they cannot be forced to. There must be joint agreement or the current award remains in place. Of course, at some point in the future that award will become out-of-date and the employer and the employees will have to renegotiate. At that stage, if those employees are still members of a union, they can nominate their union to negotiate on their behalf. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, where an employer and employees choose to establish a workplace agreement, this agreement is subject to a number of statutory minimums: a minimum hourly rate; four weeks annual leave; two weeks non-cumulative sick leave; 12 weeks paid paternity leave after 12 months continuous employment; and the guarantee of public holidays. It should be stressed that these are minimum conditions. This new flexible scheme will be attractive to many people; for example, working mothers, students, of which I happen to be the father of three, people who would prefer to work nights or weekends, and the millions of people who rush around during their lunch hours trying to do the banking, the shopping, pay the bills and have something to eat all inside an hour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Jobsback is designed to ensure that no employee loses any legal employment entitlement as a result of transferring from an award to a workplace agreement except by agreement. Despite what the Government and the unions say, a worker cannot lose his or her current pay and conditions except by agreement. Workers' rights will be protected not only by these measures but also by the employee advocate. The advocate will provide free help to employees who feel they are aggrieved by workplace agreements. Unlike the current system, workers will not have to belong to a union to see the advocate. The whole point of the policies in Jobsback is that employers and workers know what is best for our businesses and our economy, a centralised system does not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When was the last time the centralised system said, `No, you can't have a pay rise because if you do your employer will have to put off another 50 workers'? When was the last time a union said, `No, we won't go for a pay rise because if we do 50 fellow union members will lose their jobs'? When was the last time a union said, `No, we won't go for a pay rise because that will put up the price of all the products we produce, and that will affect a multitude of other Australians'? At this time more than ever, Australians who are lucky enough to have jobs should not be threatening other people's livelihoods. We should be pulling together, we should be negotiating sensible outcomes, and we should be implementing the policies outlined in Jobsback. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak very briefly on the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992 because I appreciate that time has nearly ended for this discussion. Much of the debate thus far has not been related to the measure. There has been a wide-ranging debate about industrial relations this evening, and I am not going to enter into that debate. I would be happy to do so in other forums or when another motion is put before the Chair. The debate tonight is about legislation which does a number of things, and I want to deal with the amendments to that legislation which have now become the key question. The amendments provide, in effect, an opportunity for workers who have been deprived of their right to independent arbitration of their wage rates and working conditions to have that right restored under certain circumstances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that in Victoria workers will be deprived of that right when the Victorian legislation comes into effect. That is a matter of deep concern to me because over the period of my service to workers through the trade union movement and in other capacities I have always upheld the right of final recourse to an arbitrator as a means of ensuring a fair go. In the late 1950s, the 1960s and the early 1970s, there was a situation of relatively full employment. I well recall that during those times it was the pro-communist Left that was demanding that arbitration be dispensed with. The slogan was `Smash arbitration'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was on the ACTU Executive, that slogan was being pursued by the Left on that Executive. The moderates barely had the numbers. At one stage there was only one vote in it. Albert Monk was the President of the ACTU at the time and Harold Souter was the Secretary. Many will recall the demonstrations by the pro-communist Left in the streets of Melbourne and the anti-arbitration slogans on the banners. The whole thrust of its proposition was that arbitration should be smashed and that any decisions imposed&mdash;as it said&mdash;on workers by the capitalist court should not be able to be enforced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many will recall the Clarrie O'Shea case. The streets of Melbourne echoed with the demands of a number of left wing organisations that arbitration be smashed. The boot is now on the other foot. The situation at that time was very hectic for many of us in the trade union movement. Many of us saw the importance of maintaining a system of conciliation and arbitration not only because of fairness at that time to all concerned but also because we recognised the fact that, sooner or later, the situation could well change and we  might need to depend upon the decisions of an independent arbitrator. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a considerable battle being waged within the Melbourne Trades Hall Council. Mick Jordan was the Secretary of the Council. There were a number of occasions when Mick was under extreme pressure because of his stance and the stance of the bare majority on the ACTU Executive. Of course, with relatively full employment, the bargaining whip was in the hands of those union organisations. A number of those union organisations tried desperately to force the ACTU Executive to concede. When the ACTU Executive, the Melbourne Trades Hall Council and other councils, including the Tasmanian Trades and Labour Council and the New South Wales Labour Council&mdash;where Jim Kenny was the Secretary and Ralph Marsh the Assistant Secretary&mdash;refused to capitulate, what was the tactic of the pro-communist Left? The tactic was to set up shop committees, and to say that those shop committees should be able to determine matters properly provided for in awards. </PARA>

I was making the point that the streets of Melbourne echoed with the slogan `Smash arbitration' voiced by the extreme Left.

At that time the pro-communist Left was trying to undermine the central authority of the trade union movement. The ACTU and the Melbourne Trades Hall Council under Mick Jordan, the New South Wales Labor Council under Jim Kenny, my own Labor Council in Tasmania, and Bill Brown in South Australia were vigoruosly resisting the extreme Left's attempts to undermine the representative authority of the central organisations and of the unions that shop committees to be the organisations to negotiate directly with employers on matters of wages and working conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the shortage of labour in many industries, outlandish demands were made, and very often the employer had no alternative but to capitulate. So the employers and many unions whose members were affected by the strikes that occurred came to the ACTU and appealed to us to do something about it. The employers and the Federal Government came to us also in the ACTU Executive to put a stop to this nonsense. There should be proper settlement of disputes procedures and a matter should not be left to the employers and the employees through their shop committees to bargain on wages and working conditions which were award matters. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 6 May 1970 an agreement was reached between the ACTU, the national employers policy committee and the Government on the settlement of disputes procedures.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very instructive and I suggest that honourable senators look at it because it recognises the critical need for unions to represent employees for the purpose of ensuring orderly industrial progress. We won the battle at that time, and the system of conciliation and arbitration was saved. Now there is an attempt to remove that inherent fairness of the system of conciliation and arbitration&mdash;the final appeal to an independent arbiter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only difference between then and now is that then there were labour shortages and the whip was in the hands of certain unions, which wanted to exploit their power. Now the bargaining boot is well and truly on the employer's foot because of high unemployment. I maintain now, as I maintained then, that, if there can be representative discussions between workers and employers, they should proceed in the best interests of all concerned in the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the Government and the Opposition, through amendments to legislation, as well as the unions and the employer organisations, over the years have proceeded along that line with bargaining and agreements that are certified. I also firmly believe that in the end there must be an independent arbiter. If there is no agreement, particularly in the circumstances with which we are now faced, orderly industrial progress and fairness demand proper access to the arbitrator. That is what this legislation is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This morning I expressed my concern that there may be some elements of this legislation which relied for their effectiveness on the external affairs head of power of the Constitution. I expressed my long-held view that State laws generally should not be overruled by the exercise by the Commonwealth Parliament of its external affairs power under the Constitution. I am now convinced that this legislation does not rely on that head of power: it relies on the proper head of power&mdash;that is, the conciliation and arbitration power in the Constitution. It does not rely on the corporations power; it relies on the appropriate power. </PARA>

The amendments are all designed to improve the operation of the Acts concerned or the functioning of offices or bodies established under them. Details of the changes are given in the explanatory memorandum.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each of the proposed amendments is sensible and of real value. They have been the subject of discussions in the tripartite National Labour Consultative Council and accepted by its members. The Opposition has objected to proposed amendments to sections 202 and 299 of the Industrial Relations Act. The members of the National Labor Consultative Council have no such concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Considerable attention has been given in this debate to further amendments to the Industrial Relations Act 1988 which I will be moving during the committee stage. These amendments relate to section 111 of the Industrial Relations Act and to the circumstances in which an employer may cease to be a respondent to a Federal award. Considerable discussion of the purpose and effect of the proposed amendments to section 111 has occurred since they were first announced. Regrettably, there have been some misunderstandings of the Government's policy position. Accordingly, it is appropriate for me to clarify the position and, in so doing, respond to some of the points that have been made in this debate tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's proposals reflect our clear policy on industrial relations. We support cooperation over conflict, choice over coercion and the proper protection of the interests of employers, workers and the general community. Such an approach provides the basis for achieving lasting economic and industrial reform fairly and flexibly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Australia's industrial relations system is to meet these objectives, it must guarantee employers, employees and their representatives that, where agreement cannot be reached over industrial differences, there is a fair, speedy and impartial system for resolving such problems. For most of this century, this has been achieved at the Federal and State levels by the provision of a system of conciliation and arbitration administered by independent industrial tribunals with the power to compel parties to disputes to appear before them and to make binding awards, by arbitration if necessary, to resolve the matters in dispute. The system has provided the basis for the fair and effective prevention and settlement of industrial disputes. Importantly, through awards, employees are guaranteed enforceable and equitable terms and conditions of employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The balance between Federal and State systems has been maintained partly by the preferences of the parties, partly by historical influences and partly by a mechanism in the Federal industrial legislation which allows the Federal Commission to not hear a matter which is appropriately left for resolution by the State industrial tribunal. In the Industrial Relations Act, that mechanism is found in paragraph 111(1)G. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under paragraph 111(1)G, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission can dismiss or refrain from hearing a matter on various grounds, including that the Commission should defer to a State industrial authority or that further proceedings are not necessary or desirable in the public interest. For some time, the Commission acts under this provision without further hearing the matter. In this way, the Commission can leave the matter to be resolved within a State's jurisdiction if that appears to be more appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A matter should not be so dismissed where the issues in dispute cannot be resolved by the exercise of powers of compulsory arbitration in the relevant State jurisdiction in cases in which no other resolution can be achieved. On the other hand, the Commission should be able to dismiss a matter if it is merely an attempt to reopen an industrial agreement freely entered into by the parties in a State jurisdiction that permitted access to compulsory arbitration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendments recognise this situation. Accordingly, it is proposed to provide that the Commission may not dismiss or refrain from hearing a matter where compulsory arbitration cannot apply or could not have applied in the State concerned. Without such amendments, industrial disputes within the constitutionally authorised jurisdiction of the Commission could be left unresolved and one party or another could be in a position to impose an unfair result by using much greater bargaining power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the debate that has ensued, an honourable senator referred to representations made by the New South Wales Government concerning the proposed amendments. We are carefully considering these representations and other comments made by interested bodies during consultations over our proposals and will take account of any relevant points. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reference has been made in the debate to the situation in Victoria. Recently, its Government changed the industrial laws in a way which has been widely condemned and has resulted in massive industrial friction. It has been pointed out during the debate that there is much that is objectionable in that legislation. I do not propose now to address those deficiencies, but I remind honourable senators that the Victorian legislation will, apart from abolishing existing State awards, end the process of compulsory arbitration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, the proposed amendments to section 111 would apply to disputes or parts of disputes in Victoria. Equally, they would apply to any other jurisdiction which does not provide an appropriate system in which compulsory arbitration is available for disputes that cannot be resolved by other means. I emphasise that the proposed amendments do not direct the Commission how to decide any matter to which they apply. Their effect will be to ensure that the Commission hears and decides such a matter on its merits and that it cannot be dismissed without such a hearing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last two months, Australia has been transfixed, I believe, by the debate on industrial relations. There is a special piquancy about this debate in the way the events have fallen out. The Opposition has released its industrial relations policy entitled, ironically, Jobsback. There is now very clearly a choice to be made on what policy the electors of this country prefer: the Jobsback policy or a policy of supporting an independent industrial relations commission able, when disputes arise between employers and employees, to conciliate and, in the event of the failure of conciliation, arbitrate to make an order which will settle the dispute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what we have on the side the Government supports&mdash;a system which has been amended to provide extra flexibility to encourage the parties to confront the opportunity of workplace agreements or enterprise bargains with the award system as it exists acting as a safety net to protect minimum standards. On the other side, we have the so-called Jobsback proposal&mdash;a proposal which, in its simplest form, is to reduce bargaining between employers and an employee to an individual work contract. It is argued that this system contains some checks and balances to guarantee fairness. It is our contention that that is propaganda not supported by reference to the real world or reference to any particular fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's policy is one that names a number of conditions that already exist in awards as if it has just discovered them. Those conditions exist, but many more conditions exist as well. The ones that have not been named by the Opposition are clearly up for grabs. They are clearly areas in which it is intended to reduce existing standards&mdash;standards that, moreover, I point out, have been determined by independent arbitration as fair and reasonable standards for that industry or group of workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even in the area where the so-called minimums are named, there is no guarantee that unscrupulous employers will be in any way obliged to observe those minimums because, in the very direct representation of bargaining power between an employer and an individual employee, the possibility, where there are other people in a jobs queue to take the job of the worker, of the worker being offered a contract which is unacceptable, and having to then make a choice between being sacked or accepting unacceptable conditions, means that that employee cannot be protected in any way. They are in a position of exposure. They are in a position of exploitation. There is no fairness in the balance of bargaining forces between an employer and an employee in those circumstances and genuinely they are faced with the choice of the contract or the sack. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is called the deregulated labour market. It is called by some the free labour market. Those words sound almost affectionate, but they mask a position of open exploitation with no real protections at all. While those words are bandied about in polite conversation and seem inoffensive, they mask a genuine effort to in fact reduce the living standards of Australians by reducing award entitlements and their wages as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This system is proposed on the basis that this will somehow cause the economic recovery of Australia. Taken as one element in a whole constellation of proposals from the Opposition, many of which, it seems, are currently going in for a review, what is true is this: the Opposition's proposal is to cut public expenditure, reduce the amount of public money in the economy and thus deflate the economy at a time in which it needs reflation and stimulation; in effect, in macro-economic terms, to drive the economy further into recession when every other advanced country in the world that has any sense is embracing stimulatory policies&mdash;policies that we ourselves have adopted and are applying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But on top of that, while the economy would be driven further into the ground, there is an attempt, in the pretence that something fair is happening in industrial relations, to reduce wages as well. No effort is being made to incorporate training and skilling of the economy. There is a belief in the old ethic that we should work harder, not smarter. It is an attempt to make Australians low wage earners so that they can compete with low wage earners in near Asian countries. It is a choice that Australians will reject. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the Thatcher road; it is the road embraced by New Zealand; it is the road where there may be from time to time some minor short term gain, but a long term enduring loss. It is not a way in which workplace reform and higher productivity can be generated in this country. That is only achievable by working with Australians and with the institutions that they choose to represent them in the workplace; not by working against them and conducting some ideological war upon unions. This is not, as I have said, in the interests of the national economy. It is an effort to turn the economy back into the Dark Ages. It is an effort that defies the facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In one of the speeches in here a moment ago, I heard a complaint about industrial negotiation in the metal industry. There are often times in which people complain about industrial negotiation in the metal industry but, if we look at the facts, we see that Australia is now going through a record low in industrial disputation. Wages pressure is not pushing up prices and causing higher inflation. Our inflation level is 0.7 per cent for the year to now, and we are at a record low, below the levels of the OECD. We have the settings for a recovery&mdash;a recovery that would be lost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Senator Harradine made a remark in the closing stages of his address that ought be emphasised by the Government. Senator Harradine was right when he said that these amendments before the chamber tonight are proposals that rely exclusively on the arbitration powers of the Constitution. We believe that they are the appropriate powers to enable a right that has existed in the Industrial Relations Act&mdash;or in its predecessor, the Conciliation and Arbitration Act&mdash;since the inception of those Acts, to be widened to take account of what was not contemplated at the time that arbitration was introduced in Australia in the early years of this century, that is, the possibility of a State abolishing access to an arbitration commission and not providing the workers and the employers in that State with a clear choice. When legislation is carried, if it is, employers will have a choice: the individual work contract&mdash;be Jeffed by Kennett&mdash;or to opt into an arbitration system with all of the protections and fairness that guarantees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot come to any other conclusion than that many of the things said by the Opposition here tonight in opposing this legislation have been aimed at denying people that choice. The argument that somehow Jeff Kennett has a mandate that we, the Commonwealth Government, should thus surrender our mandate in this field is a preposterous argument. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much has been said about the so-called Jobsback proposition. There are a couple of things that I want to say about that, but I see that my time is almost nigh. The proposal for the employee advocate in the Jobsback proposal does not offer protection, because the employee advocate only acts after an agreement&mdash;one that I would contend is, by its nature, exploitative&mdash;has been concluded by an individual worker and an employer. It only acts then to enforce the terms of that agreement, not at industrial law with a precedent set down by the noble tradition of our Commission, but at common law&mdash;an area of archaic law from the last century which is out of time in its drum beat and is not applicable to modern day standards. The common law does not recognise the employer-employee relationship as we know it now. It regards that relationship as a master and a servant relationship&mdash;a concept that I believe is offensive to all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many other things that I could say about Jobsback, but let me foreshadow the next round of legislation that this Government intends to introduce. The International Labour Organisation is an agency of the United Nations. Through tripartite consultative mechanisms&mdash;that is, through conferences with equal numbers of workers, employers and representatives from government from all of its member states and by common resolution of its forum&mdash;it proclaims international labour conventions which it regards as the minimum level of international labour standard in the world. It is a standard that is, in many cases, below the prevailing standard in Australia. Clearly, an international forum such as a UN agency has to have regard for the economic needs of developing and underdeveloped countries. In its next round of legislation, this Government proposes to encode those standards in Australian industrial law as a further safety net and as a further protection for Australian workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The World Health Organisation is well known for prescribing world health standards in order to lift the world into a healthier environment. The International Labour Organisation, in the prescription of its standards, does the same to regulate fair labour practice. It seems appropriate for Australia, as a country that supports the United Nations system and believes in protective minimums, to encode those standards in legislation. We will direct our attention to three standards. The first standard provides for minimum wages. That springs from a convention adopted by all States and approved by all governments and the Commonwealth. In proposing to introduce this standard, we will ask the industrial relations commissions in their respective jurisdictions&mdash;the Commonwealth jurisdiction for the Commonwealth Commission and the State jurisdictions for the respective State commissions&mdash;to define a minimum labour standard in respect of each of the industries and award areas covered by those commissions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second standard is the equal pay convention&mdash;convention 100, convention 111, and the United Nations convention on discrimination against women in employment. Those conventions will ensure that equal pay is encoded as a principle in Australia. The third standard will be in relation to unfair dismissals&mdash;protection against being unfairly dismissed and the right to redundancy. That will ensure that there is proper behaviour and no victimisation at the point of termination of employment. They will be minimum standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it unbelievable that members of the Opposition, who purport to use every head of constitutional power that they can lay their hands on to impose Fightback on Australia, resist the encoding of United Nations conventions standards for fair labour practices in this country and are opposed to minimum wages, equal pay and unfair dismissals. The fact that members of the Opposition are opposed to them will be understood by Australian electors come election time. I can guarantee that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 makes a number of amendments to the Trade Practices Act 1974 and I will be concentrating on the three most significant areas in my remarks tonight. The first relates to the merger test, which is probably the most controversial part of the amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 50 of the Trade Practices Act currently provides that a corporation shall not acquire shares in, or assets of, a body corporate where the acquisition would result, or be likely to result, in the corporation being in a position to dominate the market for goods or services. If the corporation is already in a position to dominate a market for goods or services, it is prohibited from acquiring shares in or assets of a competitor or likely competitor, if the acquisition would strengthen its power to dominate that market. This is, obviously, the market domination test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill amends section 50 in two ways. Firstly, where it currently applies only to acquisitions of shares in bodies corporate, pursuant to the amendment in this Bill it will also apply to the acquisition of assets of any person. Thus the merger test will be able to be applied to mergers or acquisitions between companies and partnerships, or companies and individuals. The second and most significant change is that the acquisition of shares or assets would be prohibited if it would lead to a substantial lessening of competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of whether the appropriate merger test is the market dominance test or the substantial lessening of competition test has long been a controversial one. It has been the subject of argument and almost constant review since the trade practices legislation was first introduced in 1974. At that time, a substantial lessening of competition test applied. This was changed in 1977 to the market dominance test on the grounds that there should be no unnecessary impediment, legislative or administrative, to the attainment of rationalisation of Australian industry. It was considered that the market dominance test would lead to an improvement in Australia's international competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the question was reviewed in 1986, it was decided to retain the market dominance test. In 1988, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs recommended the continued retention of the market dominance test and noted that there was insufficient justification for changing it. That Committee had this to say about returning to the substantial lessening of competition test:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is widely accepted that this test would involve a significant lowering of the threshold, thereby subjecting a wider range of mergers to TPC scrutiny. This proposal would, therefore, have significant resource implications for the TPC. It would also reduce the level of harmonisation of Australian and New Zealand merger law. In addition, a return to the pre-1977 test would involve increased uncertainty for business, and may, therefore, impede decision-making processes.</PARA>
<PARA>The Trade Practices Commission in its submission to that inquiry argued against changing the market dominance test. The Government supported the findings of that Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As recently as August 1991, the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) stated the view that the Government was unconvinced that there was sufficient justification for reverting to the substantial lessening of competition test. However, by that stage, the inquiry of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which was an inquiry initiated by Senator Spindler, was under way. In December 1991, that Committee recommended that section 50 be amended to prohibit mergers or acquisitions which would have the effect or likely effect of substantially lessening competition in a substantial market for goods and services. Senator Kemp from this side of the chamber dissented from that recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee further recommended that a number of factors be included in the Act to make clear the ambit of the new test. This position reflects the view of the current Chairman of the Trade Practices Commission, Professor Alan Fels. Professor Fels does not share the opinion of two former chairmen of the TPC, Professor Bob Baxt and Mr Bob McComas, nor the TPC itself which was arguing only two years ago for the retention of the market dominance test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the coalition, other groups which are opposed to any change to the merger test include the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Chamber of Commerce, the Australian Mining Industry Council, the Law Council of Australia and the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants. The market dominance test has now been in operation since 1977, and a body of case law interpreting the test has now been accumulated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the strongest arguments against changing the test is that it will lead to uncertainty. It will be years before enough cases have come before the courts to establish what `substantial lessening of competition' actually means. It is also apparent that many other comparable industrialised countries are tending towards market dominance tests; for example, Germany, France, Spain and New Zealand. To sum up, on balance in our view there is insufficient evidence to indicate that the merger test should be changed. Moreover, there are good reasons why the market dominance test should be retained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill also picks up the recommendation of the Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs that there should be a list of the factors which a court would be required to take into account in considering whether or not the merger test had been breached, such as actual and potential level of import competition, barriers to entry and concentration in the market. Of the nine factors in the Bill, at least five are already taken into account in applying the market dominance test, as demonstrated in cases such as Australian Meat Holdings. It is entirely possible that, after another 10 or 15 years of litigation and uncertainty in the marketplace, the substantial lessening of competition test may end up being applied in much the same way as the market dominance test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second major change in this Bill relates to unconscionable conduct. Section 52A of the Act currently provides that a corporation shall not, in trade or commerce, in connection with the supply or possible supply of goods or services to a person, engage in unconscionable conduct. Some of the factors which can be taken into account in determining whether a corporation's dealing with a consumer has been unconscionable include: the relevant strengths of the bargaining positions of the corporation and the consumer; whether the consumer was required to comply with conditions that were not reasonably necessary for the protection of the legitimate interests of the corporation; whether the consumer was able to understand relevant documents; whether undue influence or pressure was used; and the price for which the consumer could have obtained equivalent goods or services from another supplier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1990 report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology on small business in Australia recommended that section 52A be extended to commercial transactions where small business was disadvantaged in its dealings in the same way as a consumer. This would lead to great uncertainty in commercial transactions. It amounts to allowing parties to ask a court to rewrite a contract into which they voluntarily entered. It is also unnecessary. The courts have proved more than equal to the challenge of developing new remedies for inequitable dealings, through cases such as Amadio and Blomley v. Ryan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee recommended the repeal of section 52A, pursuant to which a consumer contract could be set aside on the grounds of being unconscionable. The Committee further recommended that legislation be introduced giving the Trade Practices Commission the ability to bring proceedings on behalf of a person who has a right of action at common law arising from the unconscionable conduct of another. That Committee recognised that extending the ambit of section 52A to commercial transactions would introduce substantial uncertainty into those transactions. It concluded that the existing equitable remedies dealing with unconscionable conduct, together with traditional remedies for fraud, misrepresentation, duress, undue influence and mistake provide an avenue for redress in almost all, if not every, of the serious cases where unconscionability is an issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to a press release of the Attorney-General on 26 June this year, the Government intended to legislate as recommended in the 1990 House of Representatives Committee report to prohibit unconscionable conduct in commercial transactions. However, we are pleased to note that the provision proposed in this Bill does not go that far. Proposed new section 51AA prohibits corporations from engaging in behaviour that is unconscionable `within the meaning of the unwritten law, from time to time, of the States and Territories', which was the position, as I interpret it, of the Senate Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This proposed provision enacts the equitable principles of unconscionable conduct as recognised by the High Court in cases such as Amadio and Blomley v. Ryan. It does not change the substantive law. It also gives the Trade Practices Commission the power to investigate alleged breaches. This amendment, in our view, strikes a sensible balance, and the coalition is supporting it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should note that our support for this amendment is not shared by the Franchisors Association of Australasia, which does not accept the argument that it would be neutral in effect. The Franchisors Association fears that some of the standard practices of franchisors would infringe the unconscionable conduct provision; for example, offering a franchise with renewable provisions on a `take it or leave it' basis with the franchisor being able to use its discretion freely as to the terms of any renewal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Specifically, the Association is concerned that new section 51AA will be highly productive of litigation, that the need for a provision such as section 51AA has not been demonstrated and that the proposed changes will lead to an extension of general law principles and greater uncertainty in this area of the law. Section 51AA will implicitly encourage the courts to interfere more frequently in situations where commercial dealings are impugned as unfair, and the cost of the change will outweigh any potential benefits. It is further concerned that the Trade Practices Commission has not yet issued any draft guidelines to indicate how it intends to approach the unconscionable conduct provision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Franchisors Association has noted that the explanatory memorandum indicates that section 51AA would apply only to situations where a party had a special disability or was taken advantage of at the time of originally entering into a particular transaction. However, it is concerned by indications apparently from within the Trade Practices Commission that the section could be used to strike down an agreement because it had the effect at some later stage of being unfavourable to one party. From this debate the association is seeking a clear indication that the new section 51AA is intended to apply only at the time at which an agreement is entered into, and the Minister might respond to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Franchisors Association's concern about proposed section 51AA is shared by the National Theatre Owners Association of Australia, although it is arguing from the opposite point of view. The National Theatre Owners Association fears that proposed section 51AA would not protect parties in a weak bargaining position against unconscionable conduct. The Association contends that independent cinemas across Australia will eventually be forced to close because of the unconscionable conduct of film distributors. Its complaints include the supply of films on a no share basis, the late supply of films, excessive film hire charges, and the failure to supply day and date release. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Association has had trouble finding a provision in the Trade Practices Act which is appropriate to its circumstances, and its advice is that these amendments will not protect it against the conduct of film distributors of which it complains. This is because, for section 51AA to apply, the members of the Association would need to establish that they were under a special disadvantage, as was explained by the judges in Amadio's case and in Blomley v. Ryan; for example, that they lacked essential business acumen, as well as being in a weakened bargaining position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Association believes that in order to be protected under the Trade Practices Act against what in its opinion are the damaging trade practices of the major film distributors, the criteria for unconscionable conduct should relate only to the inequality of bargaining position. The Association believes that it is solely due to the inequality of the bargaining position of the major distributors that the distributors can impose conditions which probably fall outside the Trade Practices Act but which are nevertheless crippling for independent cinemas and are, therefore, unconscionable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the National Theatre Owners Association raised this matter with the Attorney-General's Department, it was suggested that the Association take up the matter of unfair business practices in concentrated markets in a submission to the national competition policy review. The Minister again may care to comment in the course of this debate, in addition to the questions raised by the Franchisors Association, on those raised by the National Theatre Owners Association. Hopefully that will be one step towards meeting their real concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third amendment to this Bill that I wish to mention relates to penalties. The Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs recommended that section 76(1) of the Act be amended to substantially increase the pecuniary penalties available to punish breaches of part IV of the Act, and that section 79(1) be amended to substantially increase the pecuniary penalties to punish breaches of the provisions of part V of the Act. The coalition supports the recommended increase in penalties because they have not been increased since 1974 when the Act first came into force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to part IV of the Trade Practices Act which deals with restrictive trade practices, the Bill proposes a tenfold increase in penalties for individuals, from $50,000 to $500,000, and a 40-fold increase in penalties for corporations, from $250,000 to $10m. However, not all sections within part IV are to be subject to the increased fines. No increase is proposed in sections 45D and 45E, the provisions which apply to anti-competitive conduct of trade unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the coalition is concerned, there is absolutely no justification for imposing penalties on corporations which are 40 times greater than those imposed on trade unions. The principle at stake here is equality before the law. If a law is breached, the offender ought to be subject to the same level of penalty as any other offender. It should make no difference who one is or who one knows. In our view there is no room for a `mates rates' regime in this legislation. I therefore foreshadow that I will be moving an amendment on behalf of the coalition to ensure that breaches of sections 45D and 45E will attract the same $10m maximum penalty as the rest of the provisions in part IV. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that, not surprisingly, the Australian Democrats will not be supporting our amendment. However, I am told that their argument against supporting the amendment on this occasion is based on the referral by Senator Bell to the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training of certain other matters in relation to sections 45D and 45E. However, I submit that this fact should not inhibit the Democrats' support for the coalition amendments to bring the penalties that apply to trade unions into line with those that apply to other bodies corporate. Equity is something that I would have thought the Democrats would support. I point out that the terms of reference of the present Committee inquiry do not include any mention of the adequacy or otherwise of the penalties attaching to those sections. The coalition's amendment on penalties is therefore a completely separate issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is also proposing to increase penalties for breaches of part V, which is concerned with consumer protection. The maximum fine for an individual is to be increased from $20,000 to $40,000, and the maximum for a corporation from $100,000 to $200,000. I gather that the Australian Democrats are to move in the committee stage for these fines to be further increased to $100,000 and $1m respectively. The coalition, however, on balance favours the Government's penalty in this part. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike the penalties in part IV and part V, penalties have been increased relatively recently; that is, in 1986. The heavier part IV penalties apply to offences involving restrictive trade practices and are simply a different case from penalties under the consumer protection provisions in part V. We do not see the need to impose relativities as the Democrats are trying to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, whilst the Bill raises many important issues, it is the exemption of trade unions from the penalty increases which will apply to everybody else under the Bill to which the coalition particularly objects, as will be reflected by the amendment which we will move in the committee stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight the Senate is discussing the Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill 1992. The Trade Practices Act was enacted in 1974 to combat the inevitable trend towards monopolies as a consequence of the business world's desire to reduce competition and to increase profits at the expense of higher prices for the consumer. If we doubt that that is a fairly uniform desire in business, we have no-one better than the Business Council's representative who, at an inquiry in Canberra on 26 September 1991, stated that every business is trying to reduce competition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment Bill seeks to strengthen the provisions against mergers which lessen competition and against unconscionable conduct, while clarifying the provisions prohibiting misuse of market power, increasing monetary penalties and ensuring that written undertakings businesses have given to the Trade Practices Commission to cease or modify particular conduct are enforceable by the Trade Practices Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats welcome the amendments to section 50 on mergers and acquisitions, which will prohibit acquisitions and mergers which `would have the effect, or be likely to have the effect, of substantially lessening competition in a market'. This criterion replaces the previous benchmark of market dominance. The proposed change is very welcome indeed, not least because this amendment is the culmination of a sequence of events which started with my proposed amendment in April 1991 seeking to introduce this criterion in lieu of the current market dominance benchmark. That was introduced by the Fraser Government in 1974, mainly to facilitate the takeover of the Herald and Weekly Times by News Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendment continued life as a reference to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. Following an exhaustive inquiry, that Committee, the Cooney committee, recommended that this toughening of the anti-merger provision be introduced. I am delighted that the Government has accepted that recommendation and is now implementing it through these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interpretation of the new merger provisions will be assisted by the inclusion of a non-exhaustive list of relevant matters which the Trade Practices Commission must consider in assessing whether a particular merger substantially lessens competition. The decision of the Commission is subject to appeal. However, the main element which makes this provision a strategic provision in boosting the international competitiveness of Australian industries is the retention and strengthening of the authorisation process. It allows for a merger to proceed if the Trade Practices Commission finds that the merger will be `a benefit to the public'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without limiting the range of public benefits which the TPC may examine, these amendments provide that a significant increase in the real value of exports or a significant substitution of domestic products for imported goods is to be regarded as a public benefit and consideration must also be given to any other relevant matter relating to the international competitiveness of any Australian industry. I believe that we should consider this provision as a benchmark, because it signifies a departure from the economic rationalist position of leaving it all to the market. It is proposed to insert a legislative provision which is directed towards increasing, by intervention, our international competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where the TPC considers that there are complex issues involved, the time limit for consideration by the Trade Practices Commission of an application for a merger authorisation is reduced from 45 to 30 days. Where there are complex issues or other special circumstances, the Trade Practices Tribunal must consider appeals from determinations made by the TPC in merger authorisation cases within 60 days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments to section 46 of the Trade Practices Act, which deals with the misuse of market power, clarify references to a competitor or person to include references to competitors or persons generally or to a particular class or classes of competitors or persons. The section does not provide divestiture as a remedy, as recommended by my dissenting opinion in the Committee report. I regret that. I would have thought it was time to put some teeth into these provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill further introduces a new part IVA into the Act to deal with unconscionable conduct. The existing section 52A, generally concerned with consumer transactions, is to be moved to this new part of the Act and renumbered as section 51AB. Part IVA also introduces a new provision, section 51AA, which prohibits unconscionable conduct by corporations `in trade and commerce . . . within the meaning of the unwritten law'. Although transactions covered by this new provision are already covered by equitable doctrines, the Government considers it advantageous to address the unwritten law so as to `make available remedies under the Trade Practices Act and make possible the involvement of the Trade Practices Commission'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that these amendments are particularly important for small business. For a number of years small business has been asking for unconscionable conduct to be an avenue of action open to them. So far it has been open only to consumers&mdash;that is, in a transaction between a business and a consumer. This amendment will open it up for action to be taken where unconscionable conduct is found to have taken place in business relations between two businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the complaints that we have received of examples of such conduct have concerned small businesses which were forced into unfavourable contracts by large shopping centre corporations leasing space to them. I have also received representations, as has the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Hill, from franchising organisations in the poultry industry as well as from small cinema operators. After careful examination, I believe that the concerns expressed are likely to be met by the Trade Practices Act, as amended by the Bill. In particular, I believe that the concerns of small cinema operators will be met by the new section 51AA. Certainly the Democrats will support that amendment and will ensure that it passes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any residual concerns could best be addressed, I believe, by the inquiry into competition, announced recently by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). I would also appreciate it if the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) would confirm that the terms of reference of that inquiry are wide enough for the inquiry to receive submissions on the effects the Act, as amended, is found to have in practice; for instance, by the franchising operators that have approached us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also increases pecuniary penalties for most breaches under the competition provision in part IV. The maximum penalty for contravention by a body corporate of a part IV provision, other than sections 45D and 45E, is increased from $250,000 to $10m. The maximum penalty for a contravention of part IV by a natural person will also be increased from $50,000 to $500,000. I note that Senator Hill has foreshadowed that the Opposition's amendment will apply the increases to sections 45D and 45E. We will not support that. I will deal with his comments and with our reasons for this action during the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also increases the penalties for breaches of the consumer protection provisions in part V from $100,000 to $200,000 for a body corporate and from $20,000 to $40,000 for a natural person. These latter amendments are clearly inadequate, and the Australian Democrats will be moving amendments to increase them. I express some regret&mdash;I was told today&mdash;that the Opposition will not be supporting those. We believe that it is important that consumers receive the same sort of protection as business people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, the Bill inserts a new section 87B to provide legislative recognition of the existing practice where the Commission accepts written undertakings from businesses to cease particular conduct or to take action which will lessen the otherwise undesirable effects of their conduct. This aims to avoid the possibility of prolonged litigation. This also is supported by the Democrats. Finally, I will be moving amendments to allow representative action by the Trade Practices Commission for part V&mdash;the same sort of action that at this stage is already available for part IV. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 amends section 50 of the Trade Practices Act which changes Australia's competition policy. It will also assist small business by amending section 52A of the Trades Practices Act by not only extending unconscionable conduct to domestic and household cases but also extending unconscionable conduct by corporations, trade and commerce. Section 46 is also amended to take account of business using excessive market power for anti-competitive purposes. But the importance of this Bill is that it changes Australia's competition policy from one of market domination to lessening competition in a substantial market for goods and services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present position under section 50 of the Trade Practices Act is the market domination test where mergers are prohibited which would result or be likely to result in a corporation being in a position to dominate a market for goods and services. These are fine sounding words but they have proved to be totally ineffective to provide Australia's business with a legal framework that allows competition in Australia. In effect, under the competition policy as it now stands, mergers, acquisitions and takeovers can occur where only two competitors are left in a market. In some cases that may be reduced to only one manufacturer if there is deemed to be competition from imports. In reality, that is no competition policy at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has happened in Australia under the open slather, laissez faire, no holds barred policy, has been a spate of takeovers, mergers and acquisitions that have become unbalanced and have not been in the best interests of Australia's business. Efficient, profitable, well-managed businesses have been swallowed up as they have been taken over in merger mania as bigger companies have gone into buying sprees using the profits of the conquered company for the next raid. Profits that should have been set aside for research and development, developing new products and upgrading of new plant and equipment, have been squandered on the never ending acquisition of new companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia it is easier for a company to buy its competitor out than to compete with it in the marketplace. During the eighties we have seen the double combination of excessive takeovers by `corporate cowboys', aided and abetted by our inadequate competition policy. Good, reliable employing companies, ranging from Channel 7 and Channel 10 to long term country town merchants, have been taken over and then forced to close down or have their share prices reduced, or they are forced into receivership. Last year, the three major paint companies&mdash;Berger, British and Dulux&mdash;amalgamated, leaving virtually only Taubmans as the main competitor. Following this, the price rose 30 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Allied Mills, Goodman Fielder, Gillespie bread industry takeovers eliminated any sustained price competition in the bread industry. Coles-Myer removed a substantial competitor from retail markets and built up market concentration. None of these mergers gave cheaper prices, better choice for consumers, any greater access to supplies, or any increase in jobs. In fact, in many cases the contrary applied. The other downside of this merger mania was that it allowed massive market forces to build up, whether it is in the grocery trade with 70 per cent of the total market held by Woolworths, Coles-Myer and Franklins, and the hardware market controlled by the same Woolworths, Coles-Myer, and Burns Philp. The electrical industry has not escaped either, with Vox taking over Chandlers, Errol Stewart, Billy Guys, Brashes, Alan Cash, Charlie Carter and R.S. Martin. The other players are K-Mart, Coles-Myer, Big W, Woolworths, David Jones and Retravision. Whether the industries are retail, food processing, manufacturing or abattoirs, over the last 10 years mergers have been rife in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill replaces the old test under section 50 and amends it to prohibit mergers that would have the effect or likely effect of substantially lessening competition in a substantial market. This legislation has its genesis in the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, chaired by Senator Cooney, in its inquiry into mergers, monopolies and acquisitions. I was not a member of that Committee but gave evidence strongly supporting the recommendations that came forward from it. My National Party colleague Senator O'Chee also supported the change in competition policy and recorded his vote that way. In evidence, I supported the Committee's findings and I strongly support this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These changes have been part of a personal campaign of mine over the last three years. In any change of legislation that alters the boundaries of Australia's main business laws, there are going to be winners and losers. Australia's 800,000 small businesses and 150,000 farmers will welcome this legislative change. Even medium size and larger sized businesses cannot accept any longer that 80 per cent of their total output is in the hands of three of the four major retailers. These huge retail chains have the power of life and death over manufacturers and farmers. Processors and factory owners are caught between a rock and a hard place in their dealings with these huge retailing conglomerates. They either deal with them and submit themselves to the plethora of discounts, promotional fees, preferred supplier discounts, special catalogue discounts, corporate rebates, shelf space fees&mdash;just to name a few&mdash;or they do not have access to a very substantial part of Australia's retail market, which they need to gain economies of scale to run their factories at 100 per cent efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Manufacturers must have large production runs to obtain factory cost and labor efficiencies. If they go to the major chains and negotiate a deal to sell products, they get access to market share, but many are forced into a whole range of non-negotiable extra costs being imposed by the retailers. Over the last 20 years retailing has changed for the worse. Manufacturers once gave a wholesale price to the retailer. With the exception of perhaps a settlement discount, that was the price. Those utopian days have changed for the worse as far as Australian manufacturing is concerned. The bigger the retailers become, the more market they have, the more leverage they have on manufacturers, food processors and farmers, and the more that leverage is used on gaining more and more profit through screwing extra margins from various forms of rebate. In a paper prepared for the Australian dairy farmer organisation it was stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The lion's share of profits of the Australian retailer appears to be generated by rebates provided by manufacturers rather than allowing any viable return from endeavours.</PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly what is happening. I give an example of a manufacturer supplying to a major chain: off the normal wholesale price he pays advertising, 4 per cent; end of month settlement fee, 4 per cent; promotion and sale bill, 3 per cent; corporate supplier, 3 per cent; and discount off wholesale price, 18 per cent. That is around 40 per cent extra discount, and it is impossible to give. There is not that profit in any item to pass on to any retailer. The manufacturer must inflate his price to meet these rebates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I want to make strongly is that in many cases the Australian consumer is paying higher prices because of the retail market dominance in Australia. The dominance of retailers not only is affecting the Australian manufacturing sector but also it is having a severe effect on our farmers, graziers and pig producers, and I know, Madam Acting Deputy President, that that concerns you. While this market domination is allowed to occur, the only defence primary industry has is to have statutory marketing authorities. Retailers have become the price setters, telling the food processors what they will pay. The food processor has no option if he wants to stay in business other than to bear down hard on prices that are being given to the primary producer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everyone is the loser. Neither the manufacturer, the processor nor the farmer is receiving a fair return for his product. The consumer misses out on lower prices from reduced competition among fewer retailers, the chance to buy more products through innovation, and the development of new products. Another effect of allowing Australia's retail sector merely to merge to where there are three chains controlling 70 per cent of the market and have huge market dominance is to give</PARA>
<PARA>them the buying power to import large quantities of subsidised surpluses from foreign countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been well documented that there are over $2 billion of food products coming into Australia and increasing year by year, products ranging from imported ham from Canada&mdash;which has over 20 subsidies&mdash;to tomatoes, canned peaches, pears, and pineapples. In fact, there is a whole smorgasbord of food flooding into Australia. Much of this food attracts foreign government subsidies. There are $412 billion worth of subsidies on primary production worldwide, and many of these surpluses end up being imported under generic brands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To combat this loss of market share to the generic or home brand market product, the Australian fruit industry was forced to sell at cost or less than cost to achieve some factory cost recovery and to maintain market share. The fruit industry, like other Australian manufacturers, was not able to obtain a price that reflected the skills, the expertise, the investment and the experience of its processing plants or its grower shareholders. In fact, it was cross-subsidising profitable brand names with losses on generics. In some cases imports of generic brands have now gained one-third of Australia's market share, threatening the existence of some industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of these industries have won anti-dumping cases. They proved that imports of canned fruit were subsidised and were successful in having countervailing duties applied. They then increased their prices to take account of those duties, so that they would not lose money on generic brands, only to be told by the mouthpiece of the supermarket chains, Mr Bevan, the chairman of the Australian Institute of Supermarkets, that they were manipulating the markets and were threatened by further imports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia does not need this type of dominance that can threaten the very existence of our primary and secondary industries. Food manufacturing is Australia's biggest industry. It generates $20 billion a year in sales. It accounts for 20 per cent of all manufacturing production and employs 16 per cent of the work force. The food industry needs consideration. It needs to be nurtured to grow and flourish and not to be driven backwards by the demands of retailers wanting more and more rebates. There are some larger manufacturers, such as Coca-Cola and Arnotts&mdash;although Arnotts looks like it has hit the skids; in fact, it has been successfully taken over&mdash;which have such accepted popular products with the consumer that they are able to stand up against the demands of huge chains, but they are the exception rather than the rule. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Crean, is forever talking about value adding to Australia's primary products to turn Australia into the processed food bowl of South East Asia. I support him 100 per cent. But for the Australian food processing industry to flourish and grow it must have a strong domestic base. It must also have a strong primary industry that can get a return for its investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The foundation for a strong export industry is a strong, virile domestic industry. The market domination that we have seen built up in Australian retailing and food processing is not allowing that to happen. On 8 February, it was revealed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper that the Coles-Myer Group forced its suppliers to contribute 20 per cent of the estimated first year sales of new products going into supermarkets. This 20 per cent charge amounts to many thousands of dollars. Manufacturers and retailers cannot afford the luxury of placing new products on the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 22 February, Mr McQueen, the general manager of the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation, was quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper as saying that it could cost up to $250,000 to launch a new product on to the Australian retail market. The market concentration that has been allowed to develop in Australia is wrong. It is not helping business to flourish and grow. It is restrictive and introverted. It is killing innovation and stopping new products reaching the market. There are very few small businesses that could afford to launch a new product and, I would suggest, not many big ones either at $250,000 a go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to single out the grocery chains alone. What has happened in the food market is repeated in every other market. The hardware market is down to three or four major retailers. The electrical industry has not escaped excessive market concentration, with four or five players remaining. In Australia it does not matter what the market is, whether it be processing, retailing, manufacturing or abattoirs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cattle producers of Queensland are greatly concerned at the concentration of market domination which has been allowed to build up in the killing sector under the present competition policy. At present 86 per cent of slaughter capacity in North Queensland is in the hands of one abattoir owner; it is 51 per cent in central Queensland. Cattle growers are saying that the lack of competition is being reflected in the buying auctions and that the sales are not giving a true indication of value. Only a couple of weeks ago Smorgons purchased Angliss Holdings in Queensland. These abattoirs could have been sold to AMH, which would have resulted in a further concentration in the cattle processing industry in Queensland. When the purchase was made by Smorgons, there was a unanimous sigh of relief from the Queensland cattle industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present situation in Queensland has resulted in high levels of control which are denying the producer competitive bidding in the yards, as well as imposing restrictions on the export and domestic product potential in the long term. A merger test under the Trade Practices Act must ensure that an adequate level of competition remains. The cattlemen of Queensland will welcome prospects of avoiding any further market concentration of market domination in the killing sector. This Bill will make it more difficult for abattoirs to merge under section 50 of the Trade Practices Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the Australian economy to be market driven, market forces must be allowed to exist. A market that has excessive market power is not a free market. In many cases in Australia, through mergers, acquisitions and takeovers, those market forces no longer exist. It must also be recognised that with a small population of 17 million people, with most surviving countries using world class technology, there must be room to buy or amalgamate, but there must be a balance. That balance has moved too far one way and needs to be moved back, with a stricter substantial lessening of competition test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Economic Planning and Advisory Committee recently stated that Australian industry is at a point where policy makers may need to address the issue of whether merger law, developed to allow a marked degree of industry rationalisation, is still relevant in current economic conditions. The Trade Practices Commission, in its submission to the Cooney committee, is of the opinion that the present merger test has resulted in anti-competitive consequences. My own experience as a manufacturers agent for 18 years and my continual contact with both primary and secondary industry have confirmed my view that we must realign Australia's competition policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the last three years I have continually campaigned to raise this issue, in parliament, within my own Party and in the press, to point out the problems that Australia's competition policy is causing the business community. It is not working for Australia; it needs to be readjusted. The argument that only big conglomerates can successfully enter the international market is wrong. I totally disagree with the Business Council of Australia in its call for world scale players to get economies of scale at the expense of small and medium sized businesses. Many efficient production companies have been swallowed up in the frenzy of takeovers in the 1980s. These companies, because of their efficiency, productivity and profits have become a target for bigger, less efficient takeover merchants who generate profits by takeovers and then deprive the acquired company of capital necessary to continue to grow and thrive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Research in America has revealed that market domination and concentration of market power have resulted in dearer consumer prices and that many takeovers and mergers have been failures. The investment in the acquired firm rarely reaches the required return and productivity level, which takes years to be regained. Australia needs a business sector that is growing and innovative, that can develop new products and get those products on to the market, and ultimately be a strong competitor in the international marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The business sector will be made stronger by the development of a management in touch with the needs of its customers&mdash;a business that is lean, mean and efficient. Australian competition policy has failed Australia's business sector by allowing it to be cut back by takeovers and mergers, by not allowing business to have effective market access to Australia's retail sector, making it easier to buy out a competitor, rather than competing against a trade rival by either developing a better product or by reducing prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of the new merger test will not be the immediate panacea for Australia's business problems. The passing of this legislation will not suddenly see business have access to markets. Market concentration will not be wound back overnight. The passing of this legislation will be the first step in correcting Australia's competition policy. New retail businesses will have to grow and those businesses will have to develop. It will take a lot of time before we see competition grow in Australia. A journey of a thousand miles starts with the first step. The passing of this legislation is that first step. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation will no doubt be tested in the courts. There is a lot at stake. But if the amendment to the Trade Practices Act prohibits mergers or acquisitions which would have the likely effect of substantially lessening competition in a substantial market for goods and services, then it deserves the support of this Parliament. </PARA>

I am disappointed that it did not accept one of the recommendations that Senator Spindler and I supported in a dissenting report; that is, to give the Trade Practices Commission an absolute power of divestiture. As we develop competition policy in this country in the years ahead it will become increasingly inevitable that such a power will have to be given to the Trade Practices Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that there are many vested interests in the business community who are paranoid about such an absolute divestiture power being given. It is a power that I anticipate would probably never be used. But the fact that it is there would be a warning to corporations and business organisations that if they get too greedy there is an absolute power under the Trade Practices Act to force divestiture. This power exists in the equivalent legislation in the United States. All of these things have to be qualified by having a public interest test. It can be argued that there are circumstances in which these tests would not apply because the national interest&mdash;the public interest&mdash;is wider than just a narrow piece of competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am delighted that the Government has accepted the recommendation to change the test from dominance of the market to substantial lessening of competition. This is a major step forward. I agree with many of the remarks made by Senator Boswell, who I acknowledge has been a most enthusiastic non-member of the Committee. He made sure that we boosted our efforts and kept our shoulders to the wheel in order to bring down some recommendations. I think that was indicated in his speech tonight. I know that Senator Boswell has often expressed views about big business, capitalism and so on that would be considered to the left of the Labor Party. But I suspect that that reflects his interest in representing small businesses and small farmers. Many members of the Committee had similar interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to raise with the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) the list in clause 6 of the various tests for substantial lessening of competition. The tests are to some extent different from the ones the Committee recommended. I wonder whether, when we come to the committee stage, the Minister could give us some explanations of why the tests listed on page 3 of the Bill had to be different from the ones the Committee listed in its report. I am not saying that ours are any better, but I would like an explanation of why they are different in a number of respects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already mentioned that I was disappointed that the absolute power of divestiture is not in the Bill.

There is now some remedy. I believe that it will take some time for this section of the legislation to settle down and become acceptable in the community. I am sure it will. I am sure that some of the fears some people have raised about the change to this area will not come to fruition and that the unconscionable conduct amendment will be a real advantage for small business and, above all else, the Australian community. </PARA>

He has ordered a number of inquiries, through the Trade Practices Commission itself and by individuals looking at improving competition policy in Australia. They are all to be congratulated.

We must not allow ourselves to be guided by vested interests such as the Law Council of Australia or the Business Council of Australia. They gave evidence to the Senate Committee which would have led one to believe that if we adopted any of these proposals it would be almost the equivalent of the end of the business community in Australia. I think those fears will prove to be unfounded. I do not think the Parliament or any government should give too much weight to vested interests trying to argue that by making the economy more competitive we will end up doing in Australia's business.

We need to encourage many more small and medium sized businesses to get out there and promote themselves.

It is a perspective based on the evidence which was presented to our Committee, evidence that was very ably presented by my Senate leader and colleague, Senator Boswell, whose enthusiasm for this has been noted on both sides of the chamber this evening. He is a very enthusiastic supporter of small business, and I am proud to have him as my colleague. I think Senator Boswell would also be very proud to see this legislation go through tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence is very clear. In retailing, for example, the retailing chains have enormous power to extract extra profit margins from the people with whom they do business, their suppliers. The consequence of that has not been better prices for the consumers necessarily, but it has lead to a lessening of competition, because some of those smaller producers just could not meet the demands for extra profit margin that the retailers were asking for. As a result, because they could not get market share, because they could not get their products on the shelves&mdash;to a manufacturer, it does not matter how good his product is; if he cannot get it on the shelf it is no good to him at all&mdash;they ultimately went to the wall. That is the big problem that we face today. How do we ensure that we keep our efficient manufacturers going?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Senator Boswell has referred tonight to the drive to get Australia competitive in the food manufacturing area. The problem in that area is that we have a lot of very small food processors. For example, in the Atherton Tablelands in North Queensland we produce enormous numbers of macadamia nuts, just as are produced in New South Wales. But the companies that are processing those nuts are small operations, and the big challenge for us is to ensure that they can keep on going, keep on being productive and competitive, and are not gobbled up by subsidised competitors overseas or by large run processors who can afford to meet the demands that some of the wholesalers and retailers put on them for the extra profit margin which they wish to cream off the top. I believe that many of the recommendations in this Bill, particularly ones about unconscionability, will go to achieve those ends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems we have in Australia is that we have never really benefited, like the United Kingdom benefited, from a series of cases in the 1970s and 1980s in relation to petrol companies. In the United Kingdom there was a series of cases in the 1970s and 1980s about the unfair and unconscionable conduct of petrol companies, which were basically standing over and unfairly exploiting their retailers. In Australia we never had those cases. As a result, there has been a hole in our law when it comes to unconscionable conduct. Those holes will to a large extent be plugged by this legislation, and I am very pleased to see that taking place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say that because I am one of the people who have had the dubious distinction of having to run a petrol station and roadhouse in North Queensland for six months and struggling week after week on behalf of the company to get enough money together at the end of the week to pay the oil company&mdash;I will not say which one&mdash;so that we could get the delivery for that Friday to have enough oil and petrol to keep us going over the weekend. This is the real problem we face. If we do not have curbs and brakes on excessive unconscionability, then we send many small business people&mdash;honest, hardworking people&mdash;to the wall because basically they are no match for the superior power of the large companies with which they deal. So I think the unconscionability changes are very welcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the changes in relation to takeovers are also very important. At the end of the day we have to remember that we always have to keep our eyes open. Sure as night follows day, the big companies&mdash;not all big companies are bad but I am referring to the big companies which are particularly disposed to causing unfair situations to occur, the big companies that are particularly disposed to using these sorts of tactics&mdash;will always try to find new tactics. I think Senator Boswell would agree from his experience in small business that there is always a new tactic that they will try to use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe&mdash;I would not be foolish enough to believe it&mdash;that the legislation before us tonight is the panacea. It is not the be all and end all. What it will require is vigilance&mdash;vigilance on behalf of authorities such as the Trade Practices Commission. Most importantly, those authorities have to be willing to act to represent small business people who are in a situation where they are the victims of unconscionable conduct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of our work as members of parliament, we have all seen situations where unconscionable business practices have put people out of business, where the law is too expensive a tool to use to solve a problem&mdash;of course, that is another of the investigations of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee&mdash;and regulatory bodies such as the Trade Practices Commission need to be willing to step in and put a halt to it. Sometimes an injunction is not needed. Sometimes all that is needed is the Trade Practices Commission to bowl up on the doorstep of the party against whom the complaint has been made and say, `We have had some allegations that you are indulging in unconscionable conduct' and, strangely enough, the unconscionable conduct tends to cease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly in at least one case with which I have been involved, the intervention of the Trade Practices Commission&mdash;although it did not actually bring down a finding; it merely commenced an investigation&mdash;was sufficient to buy the struggling, developing small business an opportunity to get out there and establish its market share. In that particular market we now have two very good competitors. So one can see the benefits of an active and vigilant Trade Practices Commission. Those authorities have to utilise the legislation as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make one final comment; that is, in relation to divestiture. Senator Spindler and Senator Schacht both supported the recommendation that there be a use of divestiture powers where certain companies had been involved in unconscionable conduct and so on. This is a very superficially attractive proposition. In fact, it is probably more than superficially attractive. But, on balance, I did not believe it was appropriate. I say that because of the experience in Queensland where divestiture powers were used and where the company against which the orders were made, instead of divesting and selling off the meatworks it had, it merely closed the meatworks down. I think the real danger of divestiture is that, instead of forcing the hiving off of assets and the creation of new competition, it just leads to the closure of those businesses with no competition and with a consequent loss of jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the two senators who have spoken this evening about the issue of divestiture genuinely believe that it is beneficial. But, at the end of the day, I felt that I could not support it because I was dreadfully afraid that divestiture would just mean loss of jobs and loss of competition rather than an increase in competition. I think that view would be supported widely in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to see this legislation being passed in the Senate tonight. I am very pleased to have been part of it. I also take this opportunity to thank those who contributed to the deliberations of the Committee, because they were quite long, to congratulate my friend and colleague Senator Boswell, and also to hope that through this legislation there will be some respite for small business in Australia at the moment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are now coming to the concluding stages of the second reading speeches on the Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill 1992. As one would expect, in the contributions major emphasis has been placed on the mergers and acquisitions provisions. If Senator Hill was not persuaded of the need to change in this area&mdash;and he expressed it only in terms as moderate as that&mdash;then I would certainly believe that the contribution by Senator Boswell was very illustrative and very dynamically presented in a way which would be persuasive for anyone who is listening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In so far as the comments around the chamber generally took up many of the themes which were expressed in the Cooney committee report which dealt with this matter, there is no need for me to rehearse the elements of that report which are well known to all senators who have read it assiduously to prepare themselves for the second reading debate. That Committee said, at paragraph 3.116:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee considers that the essential thrust of the Trade Practices Act should be to prohibit acts which substantially injure competition, except where public benefit can be demonstrated. This principle is embraced elsewhere in Part IV of the Act, and should also be incorporated in the merger regulation provisions.</PARA>
<PARA>Therefore it is not surprising that, at 3.131, we read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that section 50 of the Trade Practices Act 1974, be amended to prohibit mergers or acquisitions which would have the effect or likely effect of substantially lessening competition in a substantial market for goods and services.</PARA>
<PARA>It is that recommendation and the good work that went into its formulation that have been taken up by the Government. In other words, making the change from the old dominance test to the substantially lessening competition test, I think, allows us to really focus on the effect on competition in a market rather than on the dominance of a particular firm, and I believe that must lead to beneficial consequences within the Australian economy which have been alluded to or quite graphically demonstrated by contributors to the debate. Certainly the range of transactions that would be subject to a request for authorisation from the Trade Practices Commission would greatly increase over the number that are presently supervised or subject to such authorisation processes. I believe that that can be very useful indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In making its decision, it will be very important that the Trade Practices Commission&mdash;and, of course, any court that is called upon to look at the way in which the Parliament has dealt with these matters&mdash;have regard to the explanatory memorandum relating to the substantially lessening competition test. I believe it may be of interest to the Senate and to those who are required to make decisions in relation to that expression for me make the following comments&mdash;and I emphasise them for their value in elaborating on the explanatory memorandum in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following passage of this Bill through the House of Representatives a number of interested commentators have sought some further clarification of the meaning which the Government intends should be attributed to the phrase `substantially lessening competition' which will, by operation of this Bill, be introduced into section 50 of the Act in its application to mergers and takeovers. At paragraph 12 of the explanatory memorandum circulated by the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) it is said that the term `is here intended to mean an effect on competition which is real or of substance, not one which must be large or weighty'. The phrases `real or of substance' and `large or weighty' are each terms which have been variously used by the courts in attributing meaning to the word `substantially'. In signifying its intention that that word as now proposed to be used in section 50 should bear the meaning `real or of substance', the Government intends that the test should apply to effects upon competition which are not merely discernible but which are material in a relative sense in the impact that they may have upon effective competition in the marketplace. I believe that that particular elaboration, which would have otherwise been contained in a longer paragraph in the explanatory memorandum, will certainly be an aid to the interpretation of the intention of the Parliament in using those words. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The factors to be considered in relation to the various tests and authorisations are set out in the Bill, not in exhaustive ways but in ways which I think will be helpful to decision makers particularly in terms of the emphasis when one reads, for example, the amended section 90 in relation to the authorising provision, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(9A)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In determining what amounts to a benefit to the public for the purposes of subsection (9):</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)the Commission must regard the following as benefits to the public (in addition to any other benefits to the public that may exist apart from this paragraph):</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(i)a significant increase in the real value of exports;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(ii)a significant substitution of domestic products for imported goods; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">without limiting the matters that may be taken into account, the Commission must take into account all other relevant matters that relate to the international competitiveness of any Australian industry.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that is an important provision, particularly when linked to the section dealing with the prohibition of acquisitions that would result in a substantial lessening of competition. Once again, one reads in the non-exhaustive list of matters that may be taken into account for the purposes of determining whether the acquisition would have the effect or would be likely to have the effect of substantially lessening competition in the market, that amongst the matters which must be taken into account is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the actual and potential level of import competition in the market . . . </PARA>
<PARA>And so it goes on. In other words, in the structure of the Bill there is a very real adverting to the matters which must be taken into account in regard to Australia's position as a competitor in an international marketplace wanting to have within it the growth of firms which can go out and compete in the marketplace while also being conscious of the effects of overseas enterprises themselves affecting the Australian marketplace. I recall that in the early discussions about whether the Cooney committee should have this Bill referred to it, for example, this factor was a very real stimulus to the Bill being referred&mdash;to take account of the internationalisation of the Australian economy in a way which had perhaps not been the case when the Trade Practices Act was established back in the 1970s, I think, under former Senator Murphy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Madam Acting Deputy President, I will be extremely brief, because I know that colleagues in their various rooms and hovering around the Senate door will be irritated if I am not. Basically, the question of penalties will be dealt with, I believe, more comprehensively at the committee stage. But there is no doubt that penalties for the competition provisions in part IV have not been updated since 1974, and penalties for the consumer protection provisions in part V have not been updated since 1986. If we take seriously the exercise that we are indulging in tonight and in the committee stage on Monday, it is important that the deterrent value of the penalties reflect the seriousness with which the Government and the community view corporate misbehaviour. Of course, there have been comments to that effect, even from the Bench. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a need to increase the level of penalties where they are useful and appropriate. In section 45D and 45E no penalty of that kind has been sought by the Minister or the Commission which alone are entitled to seek a pecuniary penalty. Other remedies have been used effectively to make those provisions operate in a way which advances the intention of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With those exceptions, there will certainly be very significant increases to the maximum penalties for breaches of the competition provisions of part IV&mdash;$10m for corporations and $500,000 for individuals. For the consumer protection provisions, the maximum fines will be increased to $200,000 for corporations and $40,000 for individuals. That is significant indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, as to unconscionable conduct, I think it is important that whereas at the moment the provisions relating to unconscionable conduct are confined to those involving goods or services of a kind ordinarily acquired for personal, domestic or household use or consumption&mdash;in other words, basically consumer transactions&mdash;the new provision will prohibit unconscionable conduct by corporations in trade and commerce. Thus it will extend&mdash;but in a modified form&mdash;the prohibition now found in section 52A. I believe that is extremely important and has certainly been sought by many of the small businesses and enterprises which, for example, Senator Boswell spoke about in his contribution this evening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unconscionability is certainly defined in a very interesting way to bring common law or equitable doctrines and their operation in the States into the legislation and then adding the capacity of the Trade Practices Commission to play a role in ensuring that that doctrine of unconscionable conduct is applied. I believe that, for all these reasons, every contribution has pointed to many good features of this Bill such as certainly deserve the support of the Senate. I commend the second reading to the chamber. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator Button</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)  By far the most important measure governing the security of ABS data holdings, which sets the context for all further, specific steps the ABS takes in this regard, is the undertaking of fidelity and secrecy which has to be given by every ABS officer. Under Section 7 of the Census and Statistics Act 1905 (CSA),</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"Every officer executing any power or duty conferred or imposed on any officer under this Act or the regulations, shall, before entering into his or her duties or exercising any power under this Act, sign, in the presence of a witness, an undertaking of fidelity and secrecy in accordance with the prescribed form."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, under Section 19 of the CSA</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"(1) A person who is, or has been, the Statistician or an officer shall not, except:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) in accordance with a determination; or</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) for the purposes of the Act;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">either directly or indirectly, divulge or communicate any information furnished in pursuance of this Act to any person (other than the person from whom the information was obtained).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2)  A person who contravenes subsection (1) . . . is guilty of an indictable offence punishable on conviction by a fine not exceeding $5,000 or imprisonment for a period not exceeding 2 years, or both.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These legal provisions are complemented by an extremely strong culture, continually reinforced at all levels in the organisation, that preservation of the confidentiality of reported data, and of the security of statistical aggregates before their public release, is central to the ABS's ability to retain the trust of its respondents that their reported data are secure from release to any third party without  their consent, and the trust of its users that statistical data are made available on a completely even-handed basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABS has an enviable reputation for the preservation of the confidentiality of reported data, and for the protection of its statistical data holdings from unauthorised release. There have been no known cases of any ABS officer attempting to breach the undertaking of fidelity and secrecy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The undertaking of fidelity and secrecy sworn by all ABS officers, and the strong confidentiality and security ethos which permeates the attitudes of ABS staff, are in themselves the most important elements of the ABS's security screen. They are reinforced by a range of measures relating to the perimeter security of all ABS offices, the security measures protecting the ABS's computing environment from any external access, and the security measures implemented for individual ABS data holdings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABS has spent about $2.5 million over the last 5 years on physical security of ABS premises, to ensure that their security is effective against unauthorised access. It has devoted very large resources over many years to improve progressively the security of its data holdings, and will continue to do so. Because potentially the resources which could be devoted to perimeter and computer security are limitless, the ABS's approach to securing statistical data has to be tailored to the sensitivity of the data in question. Its specific actions are guided by a process of continual assessment of the risks involved of unauthorised access to particular data, taking account of their innate interest and degree of sensitivity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Yes. Details are given in response to Question 1.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) ABS data holdings are protected by a number of measures including general building security, secure storage of documents, and password protection of the computer network, host computers, software systems and databases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The vast bulk of ABS data is held electronically in databases that reside on a variety of host computers. ABS computer systems are password protected and in many cases several passwords are required before statistical data can be accessed. Other than the use of microcomputers in "stand-alone" mode, use of ABS computing facilities requires one or more passwords.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABS computing environment cannot be accessed from outside ABS premises. One stand-alone minicomputer, not physically connected to the remainder of the ABS computing environment, is used for the electronic dissemination of statistics; this is the only ABS computer which can be accessed from outside the ABS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the ABS there are two broad categories of data that can be regarded as sensitive. The first is "unit record data" i.e. data that can be attributed to specific individuals, businesses or other organisations. The second is "sensitive output data", which consists of statistical outputs that might afford the user some advantage if accessed prior to official release (for example, the monthly Balance of Payments, the CPI, the monthly Labour Force data, and the quarterly National Accounts).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The vast bulk of the ABS data holding is in the form of "unit record data" which are in various stages of processing. These data exist in a variety of forms including completed statistical returns, computer tapes, printout, and computer databases stored on microcomputers, minicomputers, network file servers, and mainframe computers. Access to "unit record data" held in electronic form is controlled by password protection of data and systems. Access to physical forms of the data (paper, tape and disk) is controlled through building security and secure storage facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of "sensitive output data", the control over security of the data is stringent, with increased emphasis on, and specially tailored facilities for, the physically secure storage of printed records, computers and computer storage media. Commonwealth approved security containers are provided to store physical records and magnetic media. As well, pre-embargo access by ABS personnel to this category of data is limited, by well documented and understood procedures, to those officers with a strict "need to know".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All ABS premises are entered through electronically controlled access systems activated by individual coded keys. All persons  without such keys are required to enter through an ABS staffed reception area. Particularly sensitive output data, and the personnel handling them, are located within physically isolated areas, with further internal electronically controlled access systems which are available only to staff with programmed access. ABS building perimeters are protected after hours by security guards and/or video cameras and computerised entry audit trails.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mechanisms in place to ensure security of ABS data are under constant review. At present the Australian National Audit Office, as part of its APS-wide program of performance audits, is reviewing computer security in the ABS, with the full support of ABS management. The ABS will continue to take advantage of security technologies as they develop to the point of providing cost-effective opportunities to increase the security of ABS data holdings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The allegations in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Telegraph</EMPHASIS> report of 18 October 1992 are not accurate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Security of all the balance of payments aggregates is tight, and has been for many years. There has been no recent tightening of computer security on these data.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last allegations concerning leaks of the monthly balance of payments data date back to the numbers for August 1987 and January 1988. The allegations were referred by the ABS to the Australian Federal Police for investigation. They found no evidence substantiating them. Further information in relation to this matter is contained in the answer to a question on notice, House of Representatives <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, of 22 August 1988, Question No. 959.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is in fact little relationship between the security issues relating to the monthly balance of payments data and those relating to the computer files holding the recorded imports and exports data obtained from the Australian Customs Service. The totals for imports and exports derivable from the hundreds of thousands of records in the foreign trade computer files are incomplete and deficient in certain key respects as a basis for calculation of the balance of merchandise trade which forms part of the balance of payments measure of the balance on current account. A number of essential adjustments, typically of large value, are made to the totals for recorded imports and exports derivable from the computer files, to transform them into the publishable balance of payments components. The nature and size of those adjustments have been such that a simple "balance of trade in goods" measure, derived  from the computer files holding the individual imports and exports records, would have been generally quite misleading as a basis for estimating the published measure of the balance of merchandise trade, let alone the more sensitive balance on current account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The officers making those adjustments are a handful of senior, designated officers of the Foreign Trade and Balance of Payments Sections. The resulting statistical measures of the balance of merchandise trade, and the balance on current account, are known before publication to only the very small number of officers with a need to know, under stringent security controls. Also, those measures are not stored in the foreign trade data files, but in their own database, again under stringent security controls.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any event, there is no evidence, from the access logs on the computer files holding the individual imports and exports records, that any unauthorised access to them has ever been attempted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Telegraph</EMPHASIS> report referred to a review of security procedures in January 1991. That review was instituted by the management of the Foreign Trade Section, as an integral aspect of a much wider review of foreign trade systems which was scheduled for implementation from late 1991. The review of security procedures was intended to rectify certain known low level deficiencies in the security procedures relating to the Foreign Trade computer database files which were well understood, and were already being addressed by logging of all attempted database accesses. The deficiencies were not crucial in the context of the overall security of reliable, publishable statistical aggregates. However, it was considered desirable to use recent enhancements to the ABS's computer environment to remedy them if this was technically feasible at reasonable cost, and thereby simplify the security arrangements already in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The officer assigned to the review produced an initial draft in January 1991 which documented some of the low level security deficiencies and suggested some possible remedies. Following consideration of that paper a note was prepared by Section management in March 1991 outlining work remaining to be done for the security review and its future directions. The review was reassigned to another officer in September 1991, who subsequently completed it in March 1992. The review's final recommendations were progressively implemented in the ensuing three months, with the result that the deficiencies in security procedures were rectified in June 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The overall security of the balance of payments aggregates was reviewed most recently in June 1992. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Telegraph</EMPHASIS> article quoted from an interim report of that review. The review has been completed, and has shown that the security of all balance of payments measures is appropriately tight to protect those measures against any attempt to gain unauthorised pre-embargo access, and that there is no evidence that any such access has been attempted, let alone that it has occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) Yes. As indicated in response to Question 1, all ABS staff sign an undertaking of fidelity and secrecy under the CSA on joining the ABS. The ethos of security and confidentiality is an integral part of the culture of the organisation and is continually reinforced. The "need to know" principle is rigorously observed regarding staff access to sensitive data.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) Yes. Staff are encouraged to and do report apparent security incidents, and a formal incident report system is in place.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABS has noted the suggestion by Senator Short, in his speech to the Senate of 26 November 1992 (Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> p 3738), that an ABS officer was victimised for bringing to ABS management's attention alleged security problems with foreign trade data.
