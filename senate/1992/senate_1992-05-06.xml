<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of Senator Coulter and pursuant to contingent notice, I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Bell moving a motion to provide for the consideration of a matter, namely, a motion to give precedence to General Business notice of motion No. 847 standing in the name of Senator Bell relating to quarrying at Exit Cave.</PARA>
<PARA>Debate on this motion is urgent because time has run out. The Government can be allowed to procrastinate no longer on this important issue. In fact, there really should be no argument from the Government on the appropriate course of action to take. It has been made obvious, and even suggested from government sources, that the time for action is now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Exit Cave was nominated for World Heritage listing in 1988, it was done after agreement between the Commonwealth and Tasmanian governments that quarrying could continue within the nominated World Heritage area only on the proviso that acceptable limits were set to the scale and development of the operation. Moreover, any loss that resulted from limits being subsequently placed on quarrying operations would oblige the Commonwealth to pay compensation. That is a very important point. The word `compensation' was first mentioned in what are described as the Cook-Groom heads of agreement, a document which was signed at that time and which recognised that future compensation may be a question that had to be addressed. At the time of listing, the quarry was known to be within the World Heritage area. There was agreement that compensation would be paid should limits have to be imposed on the quarry's operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In November 1991, a study by Kevin Kiernan proved that the quarrying operation was having a detrimental effect on the cave system. That is when the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) should have intervened and said, `Enough is enough'. The Minister should have halted operations there and then when the quarrying operation was identified as having a detrimental effect on the World Heritage area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead, the Minister allowed blasting to continue in February this year to provide a sample of limestone for use by the operators, Benders, in tendering for a contract it had at that time with the zinc company, Pasminco Metals-EZ. The sample was intended to win a contract to continue to supply limestone after 30 June this year when the existing contract expires. That contract expires in less than a couple of months and that is why this matter needs to be discussed today. The time for fiddling about with this issue has long since passed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 24 February this year, the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area Standing Committee concluded that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . past and present quarrying operations have indisputably damaged solution cavities, sink holes and caves that are now known to be part of the Exit Cave karst subsystem.</PARA>
<PARA>This has been repeated in the Senate. Senator Collins, representing the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories, has passed on to the Senate the finding of that Committee, which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that even under the strictest environmental conditions continuation of quarrying jeopardises the area's World Heritage values.</PARA>
<PARA>That identifies in no uncertain terms that this operation should not continue. Exit Cave is in the World Heritage area, quarrying has a negative effect on the values of the area and the Minister has full knowledge that continuation jeopardises those values, but we have no action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have no tangible evidence that the Minister has taken any notice of the information which is at hand, available to her, and which, in fact, has been recognised by her. The Minister may well agree with the information that has been given. The Minister may well wish this area to be preserved and protected, but we have no tangible action. That is why we need to suspend the Standing Orders, to allow the Government to immediately act on this issue and to present to us the arguments as to why procrastination has continued. I do not see why we should have to wait for an initiative which should have been forthcoming some months ago, but which now is sadly lacking.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a matter of great urgency. We have the most extensive cave system in the whole of Australia&mdash;some 17 kilometres of cave&mdash;much of which remains to be explored, much of which has been identified as containing unique fauna. That cave lies in a World Heritage area that I understand was gazetted as long ago as 1989. That the Government has failed to act under its requirements to ensure that that World Heritage area is adequately protected is, indeed, a matter of urgency.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The damage to the area has been well and truly identified, by the Federal and Tasmanian departments of Environment. According to a leaked Tasmanian Department of Environment and Planning report, both that Department and the Federal Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories believe that even a new environment management plan would not protect the cave system. That report says that the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service favours relocating the quarry and the Australian Heritage Commission believes the quarry is having a significant adverse effect on the cave system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no automatic protection under World Heritage for areas such as this. It does require some additional action by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly). The Minister has in the past promised to take some action, but the Minister has simply failed to carry through on that. Before more damage is done, it is urgent that action is taken at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another relevant factor is that it is not as though Tasmania is short of limestone. There is no doubt that there are many other situations in which mining can be carried out for the necessary purposes of Pasminco, the zinc refinery at Risdon near Hobart where the limestone is used. There is more than enough limestone in Tasmania in areas well away from the World Heritage area. For those reasons, it becomes absolutely vital that this damaging quarrying operation, which has been going on for quite a long time, should be stopped. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I indicated a moment ago, the World Heritage declaration was made in 1989, but in 1991 the area around the quarry was turned into a national park. So in this particular case we have a mining operation going on which is damaging both a World Heritage area and a national park. We have an essentially industrial activity going on in a wilderness area which, as we have indicated, has been declared both World Heritage and national park. For those reasons it is absolutely urgent that the Minister make the necessary declarations so that this area is protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The extraction of limestone from other areas in Tasmania would, of course, employ exactly the same number of people. There is no question&mdash;as I think Senator Panizza claimed the night before last when we were debating resource security&mdash;that the Democrats want to close mining down. That is simply untrue. In this particular case we want to ensure that when this mining of limestone occurs it occurs with the same amount of employment and generates the same amount of limestone but does not go on in a World Heritage area which, as I have indicated, is in a national park. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for those reasons that we believe that this is a matter of urgency. The Minister, Ros Kelly, should act. She should make the necessary declaration. The mining operation should cease and should be shifted somewhere else. If compensation needs to be paid for the relocation of that mine, that compensation should also be paid. As Senator Bell has said, with the likely renewal of this mining contract on 30 June, it is important that the Minister takes the action now and does not delay any longer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Responsibility for this legislation has been carried in this place on behalf of the Opposition by Senator Tambling. He will be speaking after I have finished. This legislation is an omnibus collection of five Bills. It is designed to bring the growing deer industry in this country in line with the major primary industries in Australia. It sets out to impose a levy on the slaughter of deer, a charge on the export of deer, a levy on the sale of deer velvet produced and sold in Australia or used in the production of other goods in Australia, and a charge on the export of deer velvet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The deer industry is one of a number of industries that have developed in Australia over recent years. One could suggest that the industry has moved past its first excited investor stage to a secondary settling in period of expansion and consolidation. I suggest that that is the reason why at this stage the industry appears to be in such turmoil within itself over this package of Bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable senators would be aware, the legislation passed the House of Representatives with very little fuss and with the support of the Opposition. However, by the time the legislation came to the Senate, some sections of the industry were concerned about what the Bills would mean for the industry and about the industry's capacity to meet the commitment. As a result, the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs held quite extensive hearings last Monday to provide the deer industry with an opportunity to voice its concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised that deer numbers in Australia have grown at the rate of, on average, about 25 per cent per annum in recent years. At present there are about 155,000 deer, on about 1,000 farms, throughout Australia made up predominantly of fallow and red deer with a small number of tropical species. I say `about' in relation to the numbers of animals and producers because quantifying that is just one of the many difficulties that this industry has. That is a problem that became increasingly evident during the Committee's hearings. To say that the industry is in a state of flux is a misconception. I would almost suggest that the industry is in chaos and on a course of self-destruction if it does not bring itself together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the industry's very short appearance at the Committee's hearings, we received some 40 submissions from growers and grower representatives. In addition, I could not count the number of calls I received on this matter, and I know other senators on the Committee also received many. They were from deer farmers both pro- and anti-levies. Obviously each one of them was concerned at what the Government and the Parliament were proposing to do for their industry. The fact that many did not know the implications of the levy&mdash;and many did not even know such legislation was intended&mdash;is a reflection as much on the industry as on its own representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having been involved with the family law inquiry for some time, I know the wisdom of not buying into a domestic dispute. I do not know where the blame lies for the fragmentation within the industry. I do know that, notwithstanding, it was not the function or the purpose of the Rural and Regional Affairs Committee to act as a mediator. The Committee Chairman tried very hard to conciliate and arbitrate between the pro- and anti-levy groups. His efforts, I am sad to say, went unrewarded. In terms of both the pro- and anti-levy people and the pro- and anti-Deer Farmers Federation of Australia, I think it can be said that people acknowledged at the end of the hearings that there was no common ground. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee came to the view that, despite the criticism of some within the industry, the legislation is an appropriate path for the industry to move down. Industries must be taught to stand on their own two feet and the deer industry cannot expect to be treated any differently from any other rural group. I support both the principle and the practice of levies and that support includes the application of levies to this industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make some points pertinent particularly to the deer industry but also to any other industry that might be experiencing internal administrative difficulties. It is not the function nor the purpose of Parliament or any committee of Parliament to arbitrate on internal factional difficulties. It was not reasonable for this industry to expect the Rural and Regional Affairs Committee to sort out its affairs. It is up to the growers to get together and do that. It is their industry. They are the ones who should make sure that it goes the way they want it to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether or not the Deer Farmers Federation, its administrators and its executive are working in the best interests of all deer farmers is debatable. The fact that they were unable to provide accurate figures to the Committee on membership and deer population and were unable to say what percentage of deer farmers the federation represented is of concern to me, and should be of considerable concern to the deer farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I commend the DFFA on the fact that it has now joined with the National Farmers Federation as a commodity group, which I think is a good move. To the deer farmers I say, `Your  industry is in a mess and it is up to you to sort out yourselves and your affiliations. We cannot do it for you. If you continue to work in opposite directions, you will all be the losers'. The deer industry looks to be an exciting one and has great potential. It would be a pity if the breeders failed to make it work. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This package of deer industry Bills has been brought about so that this industry can be in line with other agricultural industries. The Government, along with parts of the industry, has agreed to the imposition, on a shared basis between government and industry, of a research and development arrangement for this industry. The deer industry rates highly with other great Australian agricultural industries. It is expanding at a very rapid and exciting rate of approximately 25 per cent a year. There are currently about 1,000 full or part-time farmers in this industry, and 155,000 deer&mdash;a number that is expected to double within a few years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is also an important export industry. The deer industry's application to the Government for inclusion in the research and development arrangements will make it more commercial, more able to target what the industry is after and to embark upon the necessary research required if it is to maintain a competitiveness against the industries of other countries, in particular New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is already a voluntary agreement in place which the industry has instituted ahead of a statutory system and about $25,000 has been donated. When the deer industry joins the statutory arrangements in the near future it will join over 20 other agricultural industries on the same basis of a dollar for dollar up to 0.5 per cent of the gross value of production. That will cost the Government an estimated $30,000 next financial year and $60,000 the following year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is encouraging that the industry, from its first year, is evidently prepared to provide more than is necessary for the matching grants. The grower contributions will be $100,000. It is not unique among new industries, the industries amongst these new industries or the industries that are coming into the research and development arrangements that they are prepared to go beyond the Government target. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the point that agricultural industries have set the example in this country of being prepared to make sacrifices for a solid research and development base, even in difficult times. This will ensure that, in spite of the problems they have, such as the very high domestic cost structure and corrupt international markets, these industries will survive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision of the Deer Farmers Federation of Australia has been an important one. It has not been without criticism within the industry itself. Not everybody in the industry supports it. I believe that Senator Brownhill has made that point very clear. I suppose it would be unique actually if that were to be the case. Problems have emerged particularly with regard to full support of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The detailed steps that have taken place ahead of this legislation indicate that there is a good relationship between the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and the industry and within the industry itself. There has been plenty of opportunity for the necessary discussion, communication, et cetera. In 1989, there was a deer industry workshop sponsored by the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation. On 22 March 1991, the annual meeting of the Deer Farmers Federation of Australia passed unanimously a motion to proceed with the statutory level requirement. The Tasmanian section of the industry was a member at that time and participated in that unanimous vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In August 1991, at a national conference held in Albury attended by over 300 deer breeders, once again there was a unanimous vote for a voluntary levy until the statutory levy commenced. On 9 October 1991, the Deer Farmers Federation of Australia formally requested a statutory levy to begin from 1 July 1992. On 21 November 1991, the Deer Farmers Council of Tasmania advised the Minister of its withdrawal from the national organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since then, there has been some conflict, a letter writing campaign and criticism. However, in recent days strong support for the proposal has emerged. For example, the Victorian Deer Farmers Association&mdash;I should mention Victoria has the largest number of deer breeders in Australia&mdash;at its meeting on 19 March passed a vote of 59 to two in favour of all levies. At an earlier time, in February 1991, at a special meeting of over 200 deer breeders there was also support for the proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 20 March, Mr John Andrews, the President of the New South Wales Association, confirmed that the New South Wales industry supported the proposal and rejected comments by a junior vice-president of that association. The Australian Fallow Deer Society Inc. at the same time indicated that it had over 50 per cent of the national herd. It gave strong support in a letter of 19 March from its President, John Holder. On the same day, the Red Deer Society of Australia&mdash;the red deer is the second largest of three commercial deer varieties&mdash;also gave strong support. It made the point that on deer produce&mdash;on all the leviable products: venison, velvet and export livestock&mdash;it will be the largest contributor. Therefore, there is also demonstrated support. I believe that there has been stronger support for the proposal than has been the case with many other industries overall. Therefore, the proposal should be supported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the two problems I referred to earlier can be solved by negotiation and commonsense. The first of these problems concerns Tasmania, which comprises 8 per cent of the industry. Tasmania withdrew from the Association because it had been critical of the Deer Industry Development Group, which is a deer advisory body to the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation. The point has been made by the Minister for Primary Industries in Tasmania, Mr Robin Gray, that the State feels it has adequate State development arrangements for the industry and there is a request to delay the Bill to allow time for more discussions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry does recognise that it has a challenge to bring the Tasmanians back into the fold. It was hoped that the Tasmanian deer farmers would be invited to the next annual general meeting of the Deer Farmers Federation of Australia. The second problem mentioned in the correspondence and in the phone calls received concerned this potential problem of double charging or double levies, namely, a levy on the animal with regard to velvet and as a live export. I believe that this is a matter of misunderstanding and I ask the Minister to clarify the position about double levying. There should not be any duplication and I anticipate there is no need for such duplication. That would then remove one of the major criticisms apparent from some of the dissidents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs has noted the assurances given by the Minister in the other chamber as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is not the intention of this legislation that a producer who pays a levy in relation to deer velvet for the domestic market should subsequently incur an export levy.</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee has also noted that clause 6(2) of the Deer Velvet Export Charge Bill 1992 specifically addressed this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs has also made some interesting observations which I would like to now reflect on. Firstly, the Committee found that the inquiry into and reporting on these Bills was a difficult task as it received conflicting evidence on practically every major issue raised in evidence. Secondly, having considered the evidence presented to the inquiry, the Committee recognised that the Australian deer industry is an emerging industry which will benefit from the effective research and development programs in production, processing and marketing activities. Thirdly, the Committee considered that the five Bills referred to it by the Senate will encourage this approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, the Committee has concluded that the DFFA represents and has the support of a majority of the deer industry in Australia and is the appropriate avenue for consultation under the provisions of the Bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the Committee recommended to the Senate that the Deer Slaughter Levy Bill 1992, the Deer Velvet Levy Bill 1992, the Deer Velvet Export Charge Bill 1992, the Deer Export Charge Bill 1992 and the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Amendment Bill 1992 be agreed to. The coalition supports this legislation and commends the industry for taking that very important step to be part of the overall rural industries research and development arrangements. </PARA>

After that passage it reached this chamber with very little ceremony attached to it other than the statement that the levy was supported by the industry's representative body. Knowing as I did that the Tasmanian deer farmers may not necessarily be represented by that Federal body's claimed position, I took the trouble to contact a couple of known deer producers in Tasmania. My communication with them was greeted by surprise, because they had not known that this legislation would come before the chamber in such a time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was not just a case of a couple of lonely deer breeders in the wilds of Tasmania not keeping up with what was going on in Canberra. As I soon became aware, after communication with other deer farmers throughout Australia, it was a case of a significant number of those who are involved in this fledgling industry being unaware of what was happening in their industry. In fact, on 17 March, I was sent in writing a communication under the heading of the New South Wales Deer Farmers Association. The final part of that communication reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed levy on livestock export has not been discussed at all within the industry either at farmer level or within the Deer Farmers' Federation of Australia, of which this association is a member. Several of our members have expressed concern at its impact on their activities. We are therefore unable to support this Bill (i.e. the Deer Export Charge Bill).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We urge you to delay this until such time as the industry has had time to consider all aspects of such legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>As Senator Tambling, in quoting from the Committee report, observed, the committee received conflicting evidence on practically every major question considered. The first of those questions was whether the members of the industry were aware of what was going on. The fact that they were not well informed is an indictment of the body which claimed to represent the deer industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The result was that the deer farmers themselves were very rapidly informed&mdash;a process which perhaps should have taken place earlier because any body which asserts that it represents an industry certainly has a responsibility to effectively represent that industry. I consider that such a body must also have in place, at least, communication techniques, information gathering techniques, voting procedures and representation rules, administrative and financial records, plans for the future, processes of ratifying executive decisions, and the number of other procedures which throughout our democratic history have been established as appropriate for a body which purports to represent an industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the Committee's inquiry there was considerable doubt about the accuracy of the number of deer farmers in Australia, the deer numbers and even what proportion of deer farmers were members of the Deer Farmers Federation, one way or another. Those doubts illustrate that those processes were not effectively in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to believe&mdash;I have chosen those words carefully&mdash;that the process which we undertook through this Senate Standing Committee has provoked a change in the procedures and the attitudes of deer farmers to the extent that in future the processes of representation may be more cleanly and clearly defined, and that, if the Deer Farmers Federation continues to assert that it represents the industry, that association will pay greater attention to the manner in which it acquires the mandate to represent the industry. In other words, to put it simply, the Deer Farmers Association is on notice: perform, communicate or else. That is a good thing. We can be pleased to have caused that to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During this whole process, while the level of representation was being discussed, I was most disappointed to pick up the impression that this level of representation was almost average, fair enough and what would be expected in rural industries. If that is fair enough, I think it is inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is another question which should be considered perhaps at another time. It is an important question, which goes to the heart of what has been taking place under this Government over the past years. It is admirable that this Government consults with industry representative bodies. But I think it is imperative that the Government also ensure that those bodies have the mandate of those whom they claim to represent and that that mandate has been acquired legitimately and in a manner which cannot be challenged. The mandate of this body was challenged. Having been challenged, the processes have been provoked to take place. That may be very good for the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The levies which were proposed were not opposed by a majority of the deer farmers of Australia. A very small number of those people who contacted me and of those people who I initiated contact with were opposed to levies per se. I do not think that they were able to justify that opposition in any way. The vast majority understood the purposes of levies and were quite happy to participate in discussions about what might be appropriate levies and how the receipt of those levies could be used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The discussion, misinformation and misunderstandings were related to how much the levy could and should be, and to what purposes the money raised by such levies could be used. As Senator Tambling pointed out, there needed to be clarification about such matters as to whether there would be double dipping or double charging applied to people who were paying a levy for the animals themselves and then the velvet produce, which only some deer farmers were concerned about. That clarification should have been achieved before this matter reached this chamber, not after. As I say, I think we have provoked the processes to take place so that it is possible in the future to clarify those things before rather than during. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other matters that I could go into now. If anybody is particularly interested in them, they are well documented in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of the Committee's inquiry. That <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> provides interesting reading for anybody who is interested in not just the deer industry, and not where the deer industry is going, which is a fascinating enough story in itself; the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> provides an illustration of the sorts of conflicts which arise when inefficient communication processes are in place in a formative industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the responsibility of the industry, as previously mentioned, to establish more suitable communication processes, and to ensure that the communication processes result in a representative body which represents the industry. It is also the responsibility of the industry to be able to communicate effectively with the Government if it wants the assistance of government. The assistance of government is in the regulation of these sorts of things, such as levies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other role of government is to ensure that what might at first appear to be the sensible thing and a reasonable path to follow does not act against the interests of the industry itself. I am reminded of the contrary point of view which is put against applying too high a levy in the initial sense. It is pretty obvious that our initial and most dangerous competitor in this industry is New Zealand, which has access to our markets under CER. Any levy which is applied in Australia should be applied with the knowledge of what levies apply in New Zealand. If we tax or levy our producers at a rate which is in excess of those in New Zealand, we are immediately placing them at a considerable disadvantage. All producers must be aware of that disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Tasmanian industry was mentioned and it is a fact that its producers have unanimously, as a cohesive body, directed themselves towards meeting the New Zealand producers head on in terms of handling techniques, breeding techniques, production and marketing. They have successfully met that challenge. To be undermined by an industry wide levy placed at an inappropriate level is something which the Tasmanian producers, who have been at the forefront of this industry, do not deserve and it is most unfair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In meeting and overcoming the challenge of the New Zealand producers, our Tasmanian producers have shown a level of cooperation with each other and a level of initiative and enterprise which should be admired and protected&mdash;not protected by levies and tariffs willy-nilly but by proper forethought before we just accept the recommendations of a body which may or may not represent the industry. We have been alerted through this process to those problems. I hope that the DFFA takes seriously my suggestion that that body is on notice to perform, communicate, consult and inform&mdash;or else. </PARA>

Although my comments will be consistent with those of the previous speakers, there are just a couple of points I will highlight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge the difficulty that the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs had in coming to a position on this issue. I am pleased that Senator Burns, who is Chairman of the Committee, is in the chamber because there has been a misunderstanding. Apparently, I am supposed to have criticised him for not being impartial and fair in his handling of that Committee. I put it on the public record that that is not true; I did not criticise him. As Chairman of the Rural and Regional Affairs Committee, he has been very fair to all members of that Committee, totally impartial and very constructive and helpful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the point that I went very close to putting in a minority report as a result of this hearing. The industry is so divided and there was so much divisiveness between the various parties in the evidence that was put before us. Like other speakers, I believe that we have to put the deer industry itself&mdash;not only the DFFA but also some of the other participants in the deer industry&mdash;on notice that it should not take for granted the fact that the Committee came down in favour of agreeing to the implementation of this levy and assume that it is there for ever and a day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is very important, particularly as we go through the first 12 months, that the deer industry really gets its act into gear as an industry and that it comes back to this Parliament when it wants the period of the levy extended with a much more united and researched position and a much clearer direction as to what the funds are for. I will come to that particular aspect of the matter in a moment or two. The evidence was so conflicting that it really made a decision almost impossible. It was not just disagreement on a few minor points; it was almost total disagreement on every point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past I have supported research and development for other industries; other industries need to consider their position on research and development levies. Senator Bell gave a clear outline of this matter in regard to representation and communication within the various industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not accept some parts of the evidence. For example, I do not accept that membership of the DFFA is the norm. It may be the norm in some industries, but I know for a fact that it is not the norm in a number of industry organisations, particularly in Western Australia. It is important that national executive officers or presidents of organisations get some of the fundamental facts correct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give some idea of the conflict as set out in  the Committee's report. To the best of my knowledge, the levy legislation has been agreed to almost unanimously. The report refers to the associations of Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria, Queensland and New South Wales, and I shall refer to Tasmania in a moment. The report also refers to the Red Deer Society and the Fallow Deer Society. On page 4 the report refers to evidence given to the Committee that the industry had not been consulted adequately about the Bills, and that the Deer Farmers Federation of Australia, proponent of the Bills, does not represent the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I found it incredible, as I am sure did other members of the Committee, that in terms of a levy of this nature and the amount involved, when the report was released and the heat was on, the phone did not stop ringing for three or four days with people seeking to put their views. I believe that the time to put information and evidence to a committee is prior to its hearings rather than afterwards. We did receive some useful information after the hearing. But one must say to the DFFA, the Tasmanian organisation or any other part of the industry involved in the processing or manufacturing of deer products that they need to make sure that they get the process right and put in submissions and information prior to the hearings. I put on notice that I will not be quite so tolerant to latecomers in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that tipped me in favour, though very marginally, towards supporting the Bills was the RIRDC report, which was given to us by the managing director, Mr Keith Hyde. I draw the Senate's attention to appendix 5 of the report. What concerned me greatly, and I questioned in depth the various proponents, was the apparent incestuous relationship that appeared to exist with respect to the presentation of the table spelling out how the funds were to be spent. In particular, I refer to the DFFA as the proponent of the levy on behalf of the industry. We found from the was presented to us that the DFFA could well be a major beneficiary of the levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, if we look down the table, we see one particular item for research and development&mdash;namely, velvet training language and training. If we go across the table, we see under the column for 1991-92 the figure of $46,850. For 1992-93, there is a figure of $10,000. The recipient of it is the DFFA and the Velvet Committee. Further down the table is a similar situation, with different figures for communications for RIRDC and the DFFA. The same format is used for program management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was most concerned about that table. It also lists items such as information systems for livestock and market, both domestic and international. For 1991-92 there is an amount of $10,000 and for 1992-93 it is $15,000. The recipient of this is the DFFA and Bob Coombs. As I am sure most honourable senators would know, Bob Coombs is the equivalent of the Executive Director to the DFFA. In terms of the presentation of this table, I was most concerned about the apparent potential for an incestuous relationship between the raising of these funds and the purpose for which they are nominated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was only after the hearing that I received a phone call from a Mr Peter McInnes, the Chairman of what is known as the DIDG Committee. This was when the industry was very disorganised. When he spoke to me, I raised the issue of whether the funds were truly going to research and development or whether they could well be siphoned off for the administrative purposes of running the DFFA and possibly even making a contribution to the salaries of some of the people employed there. Mr McInnes sent a paper to the Secretary of the Committee, Mr Neil Bessell, the last paragraph of which I will now read. It will now be on the public record for people to observe. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Owing to a lack of information on deer industry statistics and activities, funds have also been recommended and approved for improved information and communications systems for the industry. A contract has been organised for Rural Action to undertaken this R&amp;D and Information/ Technology Transfer. Rural Action is owned by Bob and Barbara Coombs and as Mr Coombs is part-time Executive Director of the DFFA he is ideally qualified and experienced to supervise this project in the capacity of a private contractor. Once again accounting and auditing requirements will be monitored by RIRDC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Once again, I put on public notice to RIRDC that we will need to see those accounting and auditing processes in this Parliament. In terms of setting a statutory levy, it is absolutely essential that we are assured that the funds raised will be used for the purpose for which they are meant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My final comment on this matter is that, in the broader context, I believe the time has come for a very close analysis of the raising of research and development or other funds through compulsory levies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We need to look very closely at whether this compulsion that has been applied through most agricultural research and development levies is in fact the wish of the growers and is giving a return on that investment. In the final analysis, the individual contributors to these levies have little say on where they are spent and the type of functions or processes that they are used for. At the very least, as my colleague Senator Panizza has suggested, from time to time there should be a referendum as to whether the industry wishes to continue with these types of levies. That in itself would increase enormously the communications back to the individual contributors. It would mean that the recipients of the funds and those who promote the raising of them would have to inform the contributors of their results in a practical, pragmatic and constructive way.</PARA></TALK.START>

The industry should take on notice that it is important that it gets its auditing and accounting processes in place.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs, I wish to say a few words about the Deer Slaughter Levy Bill 1992, the Deer Velvet Levy Bill 1992, the Deer Velvet Export Charge Bill 1992, the Deer Export Charge Bill 1992 and the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Amendment Bill 1992. The referral of these Bills to the Committee generated considerable interest; indeed, over 50 submissions were lodged with the Committee and several members of the Committee received numerous telephone calls about specific aspects of the Bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee held a public hearing on Monday, 27 April 1992, inviting witnesses from the industry, the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation to give evidence on proposals to collect levies and charges for research and development in the deer industry. There was a voluntary levy in the previous 12 months which, in accordance with evidence given, will raise about $60,000 as compared with $100,000 under a statutory levy. I suggest that is a fairly good effort by the deer farmers; it shows a fairly large degree of support for the industry from deer farmers as distinct from members of the Deer Farmers Federation of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the Committee hearing I raised the question of the use of that money in a positive and useful way. I am always concerned when organisations begin a new process or activity that a large amount of the money which is raised goes to executive salaries and no real work is done. I was informed by RIRDC that an amount of about $15,000 would go in administration costs from a total amount of $300,000. I think that is a reasonable amount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee's task was not easy as it received conflicting evidence on practically every major issue raised in the evidence. I am sure I speak on behalf of the other members of the Committee when I say that we were all concerned about the divisiveness and the disunity within this emerging industry. At the public hearing I proposed&mdash;and the Committee agreed&mdash;that all the witnesses be brought together at the table so the Committee could explore whether there was any common ground on which it could base a recommendation on these Bills to the Senate. Unfortunately, this process of conciliation was not taken up by all participants. My offer to assist by chairing a meeting of the parties continues to stand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where there is any concern or question in relation to the way in which the money is spent and its accountability, it would seem to me that that is an issue that has to be kept quite separate from the issue as to whether the levy should be raised. The people who have the money and who spend it should be subject to quite stringent auditing and the Committee has considered that aspect of the matter as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has looked carefully at the Bills and at the evidence presented to it and its report notes concerns expressed by witnesses about aspects of the industry. These concerns were sufficient for the Committee to commit itself to a review of the legislation in about 15 months time. If necessary, the Committee will seek a formal reference from the Senate at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That makes it very clear that while we have some reservations about the best way in which we think it should operate, we are prepared to give that opportunity. But we want the right&mdash;and we certainly would expect the support of the Senate in this matter&mdash;to examine what happens in those 15 months. Nevertheless, for the reasons contained in its report, the Committee recommends that the Bills be agreed to without amendment. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I rise to put the view of Western Australian deer farmers, as they have asked me to do. There is obviously a lot of conflict, as Senator Burns has pointed out. To date there has been voluntary funding for R&amp;D, which Senator Burns said amounted to $60,000, and this proposed mandatory research and development will raise about $100,000. I question whether it is worth the powder and shot anyway as obviously most of the difference of $40,000 will be used up in the collection process. But the Government has decided through this legislation to put R&amp;D on a mandatory basis and to move away from voluntary contributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move to the position in Western Australia as it has been put to me. The call for a compulsory levy came from a very small part of the industry in terms of numbers of stock run. I believe that the call has come too early, as the industry is still in its infancy and is still very small. There are only about 145,000 deer in Australia, and I believe we should have stayed with the voluntary arrangements for now. The voluntary arrangements and any other arrangements that have been in force should have been the way to go until the industry got a lot bigger. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Deer Farmers Federation of Australia, the DFFA, claims that it represents the majority of deer farmers. Well, operators in Western Australia dispute that assertion; it is similar to what is said in a lot of other agricultural commodity industries. They claim to represent the industry and they come here and ask for mandatory levies to fund research and development without going out to their members or the growers to ask them whether they want this to happen. Senator Crane mentioned this, and the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) in the other place often refers to this matter. If one wants a compulsory levy one should have a referendum among the growers, and not just consult an association that may have an axe to grind on the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the position in Western Australia. The traditional farmers there claim that the call for a compulsory levy came from hobby farmers, and I believe that. I have seen a few deer being run on small hobby farms near Perth because it is the `in' thing to do. In time it may well grow into a big industry. The people who have spoken to me claim that only eight deer farmers in WA use their farms as a main source of income&mdash;in other words, 75 per cent of income. Of those eight farmers, only four agree with this proposal. Half the people in Western Australia who receive their main income from deer farming are against it. Therefore, it can hardly be said that the DFFA is representative of people's views. This really means that the hobby farmers, with their own peculiar sort of views&mdash;and I emphasise that they are not traditional farmers&mdash;are imposing their will not only on the rest of Western Australia but on the rest of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What worries me is that there is no plan of action as to the way in which this money is going to be spent. When a compulsory levy is sought one presumes that a detailed plan will be presented including preliminary accounts of what is to be done with it. Senator Crane touched on this&mdash;most of the money could be going to the DFFA itself. At this stage it is probably only an accusation, but on behalf of the Western Australian deer farmers I would certainly like to know a bit more about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, there are only about 145,000 deer in Australia at the moment. Of that number, one-third is breeding stock, one-third is for velvet and approximately one-third is for slaughter. This is a slaughter levy Bill, but when one works out how many grams of meat would be available throughout Australia, the amount is very small. If we are looking for exports through the R&amp;D program, where are we going to get them from? The 145,000 head that we have is hardly enough for use in Australia without looking for exports. Perhaps the deer industry will be a big industry in times to come but it is really in its infancy now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, this compulsory levy is way ahead of its time. Most of the deer farming in Australia at present is hobby farming, and I think it should remain that way. High prices have been paid for stock in Australia, mainly in the stud market. As with racehorses, cattle and merino sheep, the biggest money is made from stud for a while then, when the numbers build up, prices go down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The points I have made express the fears of the Western Australian deer farmers.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry in Tasmania is only small but it has been very well organised and has been a very happy, tight little group. The membership is between 70 and 80&mdash;it was 72 as at 30 June 1991 when there were about 13,278 head of deer behind wire. It is well organised, soundly based and is already running a very sound operation. It has run its own levy system for some time and serviced its members very well. It has concentrated on developing the industry around filling particular niches. That is where it has had its disagreements with the Australian body and that is why it left and is no longer affiliated. The Australian body was going in a completely different direction&mdash;a direction that did not suit the Tasmania industry in any way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having had these discussions, I have tried to come to conclusions about what is to be done. Clearly, there are advantages in having a national industry but not just for the sake of having a national industry. I started to look at the membership of these groups and I found that there are three categories of deer farmers, the same as there are in most other livestock operations. There is the investor group&mdash;the people who have the money and decide that deer is the thing to be in, and then go out and make a big investment. There are the hobbyists, the people who have a handful of deer&mdash;probably 10, 20, 30 or something&mdash;and they, too, believe that they will have a nice little backyard hobby. Thirdly, there are the genuine farmers who are in it as an ordinary business, as another livestock operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the first two groups that have created the pressure here, as it usually is in these types of organisations. They believe, usually, that it requires government to come in to resolve the problems. I have never found that to be the case at all. I have found that the problems usually come with the government. One of the three great lies is: `I am from the Government and I am here to help you'. It is very much the case, I believe, with these types of organisations. The Government can help only if the industry is in good order and condition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case, not one person involved in the deer industry in Australia could say that the industry overall is in good order and condition. It is clearly not. There is, I think, a relatively low proportion of growers involved in the association. One of the States pulling out altogether demonstrates that the organisation is not as sound as it should be. I plead with the Minister not to race in to get this legislation enacted until we have these problems ironed out. That may be 12 or 18 months or two years away. I do not mind, but I would not want to see this put into force straight away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A levy of $100,000 for 155,000 head of deer represents about 10 per cent of the value of the venison meat that is sold. It is necessary with a small, high-priced, high-value article to make sure that the niche marketing works properly. This is where the Tasmanian industry has done so well. It has worked on a niche market idea. The Australian body believes that the best thing it can do with the funds that are to be raised is to spend them on generic advertising&mdash;just advertising venison as the thing to eat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should remember that the New Zealand industry is just across the Tasman. If we start advertising deer generically with no reference to the real features of it, we are going to do wonderful things for the New Zealand industry and possibly horrible things to the Australian one. That is the sort of thing that has to be resolved long before we get this deer farming operation in action. We do not want to race into something that will react against our producers. Most of all, we have to see that it works for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For this to work, the industry will require the best people in Australia, not just the wealthiest or the biggest but the ones who can make the greatest contribution. I have had people ring me from various places giving me their credentials as to why they are on the Deer Farmers Federation and so on. That does not necessarily mean they are the best. The results that the Deer Farmers Federation has put together have clearly indicated to me that someone on that board obviously does not have the best interests of the deer industry in mind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All we can ask the Minister is that he hastens slowly; that he ensures that, before this legislation is enacted, all the little wrinkles and bubbles between the various members and States are ironed out properly and thoroughly. Also, he should ensure that the arrangements are appropriately in hand before the legislation is put into effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The research and development aspects are very important but there are a lot of areas in which this money could be spent other than this generic advertising which we are talking about. There is so much to be learnt yet about the handling of deer, about the control and fencing of them, the breeding, the diseases and so on. All those things need to be well and truly put into this schedule of what is to be done. It is not just a matter of going out and promoting the fact that people should eat more deer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would just like to read two paragraphs of a letter I received from the Tasmanian Minister for Primary Industries, Mr Robin Gray, on the matter. The letter reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The deer industry in Tasmania is in the critical stage of development and will not receive any benefit from the early years of levy payments unless funds are made available to the State to develop its own marketing strategy: a strategy which is being pursued with vigour and is supported by the Tasmanian Development Authority and the Department of Primary Industry, Fisheries and Energy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Deer Farmers' Council of Tasmania does not support the direction the National body is taking because the bulk of the funds will be used to develop a generic National marketing scheme with emphasis on red deer. This will benefit importers of venison from New Zealand. It will not support the fallow deer industry, and hence, the industry in Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA>I would like that to be taken into account. It is important and I wish to see the deer industry prosper. I want the people who have put so much effort and energy into it to date to be able to make a further contribution towards it. However, my plea again is that it be taken very gently. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;There are a number of points that should be responded to and I intend to do so rather quickly. The initial and basic point was that there could, in fact, be double charging involved in the operation of the framework of the legislation. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) clarified last week that this would not be the case and that, if velvet has been levied under the Deer Velvet Levy Bill, then that velvet cannot be levied under the Deer Velvet Export Charge Bill. Section 6(2) of the Deer Velvet Export Charge Bill specifically prevents this and that point should be placed on the record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point concerns whether the industry will be disadvantaged as opposed to the New Zealand industry. I am informed that that will not be so. Australia will not be disadvantaged by the levy levels as proposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to give some information on the third point which was made by Senator Panizza. His question basically was, why go to a compulsory levy when it would only collect $100,000 in 1992-93 as opposed to one that collects $60,000 in 1991-92? I am told that there are advantages in having a compulsory levy, not only in terms of the $100,000 that is involved, but also in that the compulsory levy arrangements, in one way or another, will provide $250,000 to $300,000 per annum for research and development in the industry. This is money which otherwise would not have flowed through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a result of the impact of two aspects. Firstly, the RIRDC will provide assistance to the industry of some $170,000 in 1992-93 for research and development. The other aspect is that compulsory levy arrangements will attract matching Commonwealth contributions of up to 0.5 per cent of gross value of production.

As was indicated at the hearing of Estimates Committee A, the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff has made major changes to the way in which <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> is published and printed.

As Mr Templeton advised the Committee, the Department is currently negotiating revised printing costs for 1992-93 with the Australian Government Publishing Service. However, cost is not the only factor that the Department must take into account in considering its printing and distribution requirements. The other principal factor is the capacity of any alternative printer to produce the volume of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansards</EMPHASIS> required in the very short time available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each day, 2,500 copies of each <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Hansard</EMPHASIS> for both chambers are printed: around 1,000 copies of each chamber <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Hansard</EMPHASIS> are distributed within Parliament House, with the remainder distributed externally. On average, each <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Hansard</EMPHASIS> consists of 150 pages, which means that 750,000 pages of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansards</EMPHASIS> are printed, collated and delivered in the space of a few hours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the most topical example I can give is the production of the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Hansard</EMPHASIS> for Monday, 4 May.

The last camera-ready pages of the daily were supplied by DPRS to AGPS at 5.45 a.m. and the printed Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Hansards</EMPHASIS> were delivered to Parliament House by 9.15 a.m. on the same day.

That increase in charge quite clearly exceeds any increase in postage costs to the AGPS during this time.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is in existence a letter from the DPP saying that, in his view, the documents could in fact be construed as already being on the public record.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I said, that latter part of the statement by the Minister is absolute nonsense and, as to the earlier part, he has simply been badly informed. With regard to the same matter, a letter dated 3 April 1992, written again by Geoff Gray, the Assistant Director in the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to my letter of 4 March 1992 in relation to the Cabinet documents that became exhibits in the committal proceedings. A copy is attached for your assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should point out, for the sake of completeness, that on 5 June 1989, at a time before any Cabinet documents had been tendered in the proceedings, the Magistrate made an order allowing all parties to the proceedings to have access to the documents. That order was made subject to the following condition, namely:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Until such other application or other order, the documents referred to as the "Cabinet Minutes" not be published to persons who are not parties to these proceedings".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No reference was made to that order when the relevant Cabinet documents were subsequently tendered and accepted as exhibits by the Magistrate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The view the DPP took at the time was that the order admitting the documents into evidence overrode the condition attached to the earlier order and that, accordingly, the condition did not apply to the documents once they became exhibits. My letter of 4 March 1992 was prepared on that basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the view has been expressed that the condition attached to the order of 5 June 1989 may have continued to apply to the documents after they became exhibits. If that is so, the relevant documents may not have become part of the public record.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the heavying bit I referred to. The letter continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I attach a copy of the relevant part of the transcript of the committal proceedings. I doubt whether the order made on 5 June 1989 can have had any effect once the documents were admitted as exhibits. However, that is an issue on which the Committee may wish to obtain its own legal advice.</PARA>
<PARA>We may well do so. I wish to make the point that, contrary to what Senator Tate told us a few moments ago, the DPP took the view that, at the time the documents were tendered to become exhibits, the admitting of those documents eroded the condition attached to the earlier order and, accordingly, they became part of the public record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not what Senator Tate told us. He said that there simply was nobody there&mdash;that they were not quick enough, that they were incompetent, or something of that nature. That is simply not the case. The Director of Public Prosecutions has told us in this letter that he deliberately formed the view that that condition had been eroded and did not apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He then alludes to what is quite clearly a heavying exercise by the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet&mdash;that in fact the condition did continue to apply; that despite the fact that something is on the public record, it is somehow confidential and cannot be mentioned. What absolute nonsense. We are talking about the public interest here and the bureaucratic argument that the Department is continuing with is not in the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As these documents have already been placed on the public record, and have become public, it is surely a nonsense to try to pretend that they somehow become private and confidential and can be hidden away and swept under the carpet. It is essential that these documents form part of the report that the Committee makes when it finally reports to the Senate, as it is required to do. Everybody needs to be properly informed as to the way the whole matter was conducted. I would ask the Minister to ensure that a serious reconsideration be given to this matter. Bureaucratic attitudes should not be considered and public interest should be the dominant force. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, but give me a chance. What I am  prepared to do is give the undertaking that Senator Bishop asked for, namely, that serious consideration be given to the public policy considerations that ought to apply where we need to take several matters into account. I want the honourable senator to agree that it is reasonable to take a range of matters into account. One is the fact that these documents did reach the public record, at least for a time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, there is a longstanding practice observed by the leaders of all political parties in relation to Cabinet documents that they give their concurrence, subject to strict conditions, to the release of those public documents when asked to do so. As I understand it, in this case the general condition agreed to by Dr Hewson, for example, in allowing the release of the documents to the parliamentary Committee was the basis of confidentiality enshrined in the statutes relating to that Committee's operations. Thirdly, we would need to take into account the general policy evident behind the formulation by this Parliament of the Freedom of Information Act. We must be careful to keep in mind that general policy in relation to any particular matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, the honourable senator asked for this to be looked at in the light of public policy considerations. To be fair to officers, I think it has to be looked at in a very wide context. It certainly ought to be looked at in the context of this Parliament's own statutes which deal with the release of such information. I undertake to give serious consideration to those policy issues in the light of this specific instance and not wait for some general reconsideration of FOI principles. But clearly it would have to be taken in the context of this Parliament's express wish in relation to FOI principles. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My remarks relating to the freedom of information question are simply a reminder to the Government. I would be grateful if the Minister could convey the message to his colleague, the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy). Perhaps this will make him hurry up and re-make the regulations to effect the recommendation in the report regarding the highly unsatisfactory situation where certificates which preclude the release of information in perpetuity can be issued.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am anxious to see the committee's recommendation of a two-year limit followed. This is the desirable limit&mdash;certainly not five years as the original regulation provided. I also want to see some mechanism whereby someone who is a third party can also have the right to have a decision reviewed. That is quite aside from the question that I am addressing with regard to the specific documents that were tendered to the court and which became part of the public record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the matter that the Minister raised as a side issue of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) giving his concurrence, almost comes in the category of a red herring. I would be almost prepared to lay money on it that nobody told the Leader of the Opposition at the time that these documents had in fact been made part of the public record and tendered in court. I would be most interested to see any evidence to the contrary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the second point, I think it is the most extraordinary argument that I have heard for a long time that documents that have become part of the public record can suddenly be reconverted into being private, confidential and protected by statutes from which they have already been exempted. I would have thought that the decision made by the court was the precedent that ought to be followed. I do, however, accept the Minister's undertaking to examine the need for the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet to reconsider its bureaucratic action in continuing to argue that the documents made available to us have been made available on a confidential-only basis. Presumably, the Minister is arguing that if the documents can be obtained from somewhere else, there is no problem. But we want it to be done correctly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accept the Minister's undertaking that he will look at the question of whether confidential documents can be released and provided to us so that in the public interest, and as a matter of public policy, the Senate can be properly informed when this report comes into this chamber.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very concerned.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Saturday 9 November 1991, which was the second day of the World Women's Congress for a Healthy Planet, some of the things that were considered were, for example, raised by Ms Ellen Johnson from Equator Advisory Services, Liberia, who spoke about interdependence or dependency, trade, debt and aid relations between nations and regions. Rosalie Bertrell of the International Institute of Concern for Public Health, Canada, talked about ethical considerations of nuclear power and weapons and other threats to public health and the environment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will hazard an answer. I imagine, as Senator O'Chee would know, that matters of reproductive concern can be related to particular environmental conditions and hazards. For example, exposure to lead and the controversy that surrounds it would not be of concern to a male in his prime of life, but would be of concern to a pregnant woman. In other words, given a particular environmental context, there are health related matters of particular concern to women.</PARA></TALK.START>

All these matters might affect women. It may also be that more specifically related environmental improvement programs which would otherwise be undertaken by the governments might not be undertaken. I guess that would be a consequence which would impact on women, sometimes in the specific ways that I have described. That is just a broad answer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) most warmly for having a guess, but, with respect, this is not Pick-a-Box. I was hoping that the Minister might be able to give us some information as to exactly what was said at these conferences, these assemblies. Under those topics or in the earlier assembly, which was the Global Assembly of Women in the Environment: Partners in Life, what specifically related to women, for example, in success stories about waste disposal in Africa and so on?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just want to pick up something that the Minister said in relation to pregnancy. Goodness gracious me, I think men might be just as easily susceptible to various environmental factors relating to reproduction, which could equally be the subject of a conference, but they are not. I would have thought that there would have been a view. I certainly heard a view expressed by one of the Minister's colleagues from New South Wales in a panel discussion at which I was present today. He said that pregnancy and having children was a matter of joint responsibility and concern to the man and woman. On the basis of what Senator Tate's parliamentary colleague said, clearly there does not seem to be terribly much substance in Senator Tate's answer that it might have something to do with reproduction. </PARA>

There are obviously many hundreds of papers delivered at these conferences, each of which might have a title which would be a good subject for a press release. It might be more helpful if I ask the officer concerned to meet with Senator O'Chee and perhaps provide copies of any particular papers that were delivered that are of particular interest to Senator O'Chee. It is nevertheless evident that women may have an interest and general concern in environmental degradation. By that I did not want to imply that women are the only ones interested, for example, in the health of the next generation because they are mothers. That would be trivialising the point I am trying to make.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, the decision of the Reserve Bank and the announcement by the Treasurer of a lowering of cash rates by one percentage point are important. That will bring cash rates down to 6 1/2 per cent. Short term interest rates have now reached their lowest level since the mid-1970s. Long term interest rates have fallen to levels not seen since the late 1970s.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lowering of interest rates reflects importantly the progress that has been made in reducing inflation and inflationary expectations in Australia. Progress on inflation means that lower interest rates are sustainable. CPI inflation is now down to 1.7 per cent, which is below the latest average annual inflation rate of 2.5 per cent for our OECD trading partners. The underlying rate, excluding volatile and seasonal factors, is now down to about 3 per cent. This is the lowest underlying rate since the index was first calculated in 1971.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason interest rates are back down to the levels of the 1970s is that inflation is now back to well below the levels of the 1970s, and this Government intends to keep them there.

I think the only threat to that is the introduction of an industrial relations policy of the kind which Opposition senators seem to be advocating now&mdash;the so-called big bang industry policy which, I assure the Opposition, will produce big bang wages policies and be a threat to inflation and, of course, to interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measures announced in the One Nation statement, together with the cumulative effects of the successive easing of monetary policy, are helping to drive the recovery and to secure it. The Government expects today's reduction in cash rates to be passed on promptly by the banking system. I must say as Industry Minister that I am particularly concerned that these reductions be passed on to small and medium sized business borrowers, many of whom are still paying relatively high overdraft rates. Banks and their business customers should seek to use cheaper financing through bills in order to take full advantage of the lower interest rate structure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government also expects the reduced cash rates to be reflected in reduced rates for existing home mortgages as well as for people who obtain new mortgages. Hopefully, they will be reflected in credit card interest rates, which have not fallen in line with the reductions in other interest rates since 1990. Lower rates for housing and credit cards do not just benefit the consumers.

The first priority will be to try to redeploy within the organisation. Even if people are not doing the same task, they will still have a job within the organisation.

The question is therefore a substantial one and worth a reply. It is said that if you want to have an operation, visit a surgeon; if you want to be treated, visit a physician; and if you prefer a natural cure, visit a herbalist. Dr Wood is an economist and the economics editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of people write about industrial relations. Industrial relations is a distinct discipline. It ought to be treated within the parameters of that discipline. I am not saying that economists, lawyers and social scientists should not have something to say about industrial relations, but it is important to remember that ultra-dry economists dealing with industrial relations have fundamental problems. Ultra-dry economists have a fundamental problem in dealing with industrial relations because they do not understand human behaviour and human aspirations. They are unable to answer the subjective question that is central to industrial relations: what is fair? They have economic theory. In their case, if real life does not imitate theory, real life is out of step and theory is right, people should change to conform with theory. That is the first error that Dr Wood committed in his article.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other errors Dr Wood committed are that he supports the New Zealand industrial relations model; he is prejudiced about trade unions; and he has a lopsided view of the facts in the APPM dispute. Even though he criticises APPM for letting down the Right of the political spectrum in Australia for being too fascist in its behaviour, that is because in real life even APPM does not conform with his theory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two other key parts to what Dr Wood has said. Firstly, he supports the Liberal industrial relations policy to bypass trade unions and scrap the Industrial Relations Commission. Secondly, he condemns the Liberal Premier of Tasmania, Ray Groom, for not conforming to theory. In the first part, Dr Wood asks this rhetorical question that John Howard has constantly asked: what is wrong with an employer dealing directly with an employee? He asks what can possibly be wrong with that. Anyone who watches the top rating ABC television program <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Investigators</EMPHASIS> will know that people dealing with big or small corporations or shysters do not always get treated fairly. Some of those consumer developments can be transposed into the industrial relations situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But if we want to ask whether there can be fair dealing, let us consider power shares and the balance of negotiating shares in this situation. On one side is the right to hire, fire, promote, demote, transfer direct and control access in part to training and all the resources to conduct negotiation. On the other side is someone who needs a job, who may have some skill to market and who has limited resources to bargain. That is why people join trade unions. The industrial relations system exists in order to referee the behaviour of both sides to get an outcome which is good and fair. That applies to unions if they monster small employers as well as applying to employers who might monster small workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the Ray Groom question. Ray Groom has apparently committed the sin of saying that he recognises there is a role for trade unions; that APPM should come to the table, sit down and talk to them to settle the dispute; that the ACTU President, Mr Martin Ferguson, is a man of principle; that the H.R. Nicholls Society should butt out of the issue in Tasmania; and that politicians driven by ideology do not succeed in politics. They are apparently the mistakes of Ray Groom. That is why Dr Wood has turned his guns on Mr Groom.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Wood has criticised Mr Groom for not being intellectually gifted because he does not understand the Wood theory of economics. He thinks that Mr Groom should back the dry economic theorists in Dr Hewson and Mr Howard so that life can imitate theory. Even though Mr Groom is the elected Premier of Tasmania trying to manage a situation of great complexity and difficulty there, Dr Wood thinks that he should line up behind the ultra-dry conservative industrial relations policies of the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude this answer by saying that just this week Dr Hewson, no doubt ably abetted and supported by Mr Howard, delivered a body blow to Tasmania in causing the rejection of the resource security Bill in this chamber. Dr Wood is asking that Ray Groom do to industrial relations what the Opposition has done here to resource security: destroy the industrial relations system. It is about time that the theorists got off their theoretical wavelength and joined real life, and it is about time Dr Hewson and Mr Howard actually came out and endorsed the Liberal Premier of Tasmania and his industrial relations policies and enabled him to resolve the issues that exist within that State. I hope they come out and say, `We support Ray Groom'.</PARA>

We have had the visit permitted, as Senator Chamarette said, to Daw Aung San Suu Kyi by her husband. It is the case that Burmese authorities are still adhering to a cease-fire against the Karen forces near the Thai-Burma border. The assessment we make is one of taking only very cautious encouragement from these announcements.

However, the statement that was made can be discouraging to those people who are concerned about the situation. Why is the Government not choosing this time to maintain or increase pressure on SLORC, because we have had some results, in order to achieve the release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and all political prisoners to allow the National League for Democracy to convene the Assembly, draft a constitution and hold a referendum to ensure the support of the people in Burma?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not talking about decreasing pressure; I am simply talking about putting on hold any efforts to increase pressure in a more overt way than has been the case so far. I have been extremely active on this issue, including in China as recently as three weeks or so ago, making a very strong pitch to both Premier Li Peng and, more particularly, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen about the role and responsibilities of China in relation to Burma, describing the country in the process as one run by an ugly regime in a situation that was manifestly at that stage getting uglier with each passing week, and with the situation being created where it appeared that China was the country's only remaining international friend as well as being a substantial supplier of arms that were being used by the Burmese regime against its own people.

Sometimes pressure is best applied not so much through the more public vehicles that might attract more obvious notoriety but through back room diplomacy and representations of that kind. We are not in any way reducing the pressure. We are not in any way applauding what has happened. So far as we know, there are still nearly 2,000 political prisoners in custody and an absolutely appalling track record. It will take a lot more to change the reputation of that regime.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am happy, as always, to brief the Parliament on the current situation on the ground in Cambodia, and to do so as best I can without talking the situation either up or down apropos of comments from the Leader of the Opposition on radio this morning. It is in nobody's interest to distort the realities of the picture as it presently stands.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are still trying to put together a detailed picture of what happened over the last couple of days in Kompong Thom. Obviously there was a significant breach of the cease-fire by the Khmer Rouge. But current indications are that the number of troops involved in the fighting was smaller than first reported. The Secretary-General's representative, Mr Akashi, said in New York last evening Australian time that the fighting was not on a major scale. Lieutenant-Colonel Ayling, the commander of the Australian force communications unit, said on ABC radio in a direct interview just a couple of hours ago that nothing had happened which will endanger the forward momentum of the peace process&mdash;and that does seem to reflect the general view that is prevailing now in Phnom Penh, although the incident is being taken seriously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Kompong Thom has always been one of the most volatile areas in Cambodia. A further outbreak of military action, although we had all hoped otherwise, was not totally unexpected. That is especially so in the context of the deadline that is getting very close for the announcement, as Lieutenant-Colonel Ayling said, of the phase two aspect of the peace process&mdash;that is to say, the introduction of a verified cease-fire as compared with the presently unverified one&mdash;and the commencement of the process of cantonment and disarmament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the Khmer Rouge have again been misbehaving in Kompong Thom and that they deserve censure on this occasion as previously. But there are a couple of further points to be made. The first is that discussions are taking place right now, as I understand it, with senior Khmer Rouge leadership in Phnom Penh in an attempt to find a lasting solution to the problem in Kompong Thom province. The problems relating to that are a mixture, going among other things to problems with the chain of leadership authority in the NADK, the Khmer Rouge army; problems with the apparent inability of the commanders or the military liaison people on the spot to make detailed decisions of a prompt and effective kind; and also problems associated with the degree of indiscipline by the local Khmer Rouge commanders. Again, the Supreme National Council at its meeting scheduled for tomorrow will, I am told, be considering the situation in Kompong Thom as a major agenda item.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point to be made is that the deployment of the whole UN peacekeeping operation is still only in its very early stages and that the dynamics of the imposition of UN authority, the confidence building that goes with that, and the respect for the settlement process that will, we believe, go with that, will not really be able to be fully established until we are further down the deployment track.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have stressed on many occasions on behalf of the Government, it is vitally important that the deployment of all the UN personnel, that is the nearly 16,000 troops plus the 5,000 or 6,000 other civilian personnel that will eventually be required, needs to be completed as soon as possible; in particular, the deployment needed to implement the process of cantonment and demobilisation of the 200,000 or so troops that are involved in that process&mdash;not half a million, the figure that was used again on ABC radio this morning. We therefore welcome the announcement made yesterday our time by Mr Akashi that UN troops originally intended to be transported by sea will now be airlifted to Cambodia and that, by this means, the UN intends to increase the current number of 4,000 troops in Cambodia to a total of 11,450 by 2 June.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in this context of an accelerated deployment, and also in the context of the inability of the UN to quickly get access to the logistics expertise it needs to accomplish that deployment, that Australia positively responded to the urgent request that we received from the UN a few days ago to provide an interim movement control unit to assist in that deployment process, the subject of the announcement by Senator Ray in Parliament yesterday. I repeat Senator Ray's advice, that the 30 personnel concerned will be required by the UN for a period of just four months; it is not a permanent deployment. It is a deployment in order to accelerate the process of implementing troops on the ground.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">PRESS BRIEFING BY SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE FOR CAMBODIA</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At a press briefing at Headquarters this afternoon, Yasushi Akashi, Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Cambodia, provided correspondents with an update on recent events regarding implementation of the mandate of the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Akashi said he had travelled to Phnom Penh on 15 March, when deployment of UNTAC had begun, and had been accompanied by almost all senior officials, as well as the Force Commander, Lieutenant-General John M. Sanderson of Australia. Since then, a solid United Nations presence had been established in all domains.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first progress report on the Authority, which was not due until 1 June, would be sent by the Secretary-General to the Security Council in the next day or two, he continued. The report was being sent to the Council in advance of its due date in light of substantial developments, such as the Secretary-General's visit to Cambodia, from 18 to 20 April.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The UNTAC was not a peace-keeping operation in the narrow sense of the term; it was a multidimensional and complex operation involving peace-keeping, peace-making and peace-building, Mr Akashi said. The Authority would comprise a civil administration component, in which it had oversight and control functions over the four factions; human rights oversight responsibilities, in view of tragic past events in Cambodia; a component charge with the maintenance of law and order, in view of such factors as insecurity and banditry; and a component charged with the repatriation of refugees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Akashi went on to say that he had been present, along with Prince Norodom Sihanouk, when the repatriation of refugees from the Thai border commenced on 30 March. Subsequently, repatriation had been suspended for the Cambodian New Year and later resumed. It would be an "uphill task" to complete the return of some 370,000 refugees by the target date of the end of December, but that target had not been changed. He said the Secretary-General had, while in Cambodia, issued an international appeal for the rehabilitation of that country, whose physical infrastructure had been almost completely destroyed over the past two decades. The aggregate amount of rehabilitation assistance required for Cambodia was $593 million, including $160 million for the refugee component.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The UNTAC was not only the largest United Nations peace-keeping operation in history, it was also uniquely multidimensional, he continued. The Authority was responsible for organising democratic and fair elections, which were scheduled to take place in April or early May of next year. Despite certain delays in the deployment of both military and civilian elements, Mr Akashi said he was confident that elections would be held in the anticipated time-frame.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be necessary to accelerate the deployment of various troops as well as civilians in order to adhere to the target of beginning phase II of the cease-fire&mdash;the "verified cease-fire"&mdash;by 1 June, he continued. Many troops which were originally intended to be transported by sea would be airlifted in order to meet that deadline. In June, the rainy season would begin and would considerably hinder UNTAC's movements. For that reason, deployment of the Authority's major elements should take place by the end of May, in order to verify the cease-fire and start the cantonment and demobilisation of up to 70 per cent of troops of the four factions, numbering some 200,000. The Secretary-General's original proposal for 52 cantonment sites had been revised to 55.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There had been intermittent fighting in the north-central province of Kompong Thom, where troops of the four factions were mingled, he went on. The Authority had largely succeeded in restoring the cease-fire and disengaging the factional troops from each other through deployment of two companies of an Indonesian battalion to Kompong Thom. Mr Akashi said he had received a telephone report this morning that fighting had resumed in that province, adding that he did not think fighting was on a "major scale".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United Nations presence had had a reassuring impact on the population as a whole, he said. The UNTAC had established a good working relationship with the Supreme National Council (SNC) and its head, Prince Sihanouk, who had been responsible, dynamic and helpful. Following close consultations with Prince Sihanouk, it was decided that the Authority would largely propose the agenda of meetings of SNC. A recent proposal had been draft electoral laws, which were currently being discussed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Authority had also proposed a new mechanism to investigate human rights violations and take corrective action if necessary, as authorised by the Paris Accords of 23 October 1991. A hotline had been established connecting the Special Representative, the Force Commander and representatives of the four factions. Another proposal, which had been accepted, was the establishment of subsidiary bodies of SNC, called technical advisory committees, to address the details of issues such as rehabilitation assistance and refugee repatriation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Akashi said he was pleased that the Authority's initial deployment had been favourably received. Despite, or perhaps because of, adverse physical work conditions, the staff was in good spirits and had a high morale. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (ACABQ) would commence its consideration of the Authority's revised, six-month budget on Wednesday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Flora Lewis had written an opinion piece in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New York Times</EMPHASIS> on mines in Cambodia, he continued. Mines were certainly a serious concern in that country, as they were sometimes made of plastic and wood and were thus undetectable by traditional means. Trained dogs were assisting in mine detection, which was labour-intensive and time-consuming. Mine-clearance would determine the amount of land which would be available for returnees, and was therefore being given high priority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A Cambodian Mine Action Centre had been established with SNC and UNTAC sharing the Centre's responsibilities, he said. Prince Sihanouk would be its President and Mr Akashi its Vice-President. The Centre would serve as a vehicle for financial contributions from donor countries. Some 5,000 Cambodians had been trained in mine-clearance, and would de-mine their country. Mine-clearance would be carried out for years and even decades to come.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to a question, Mr Akashi said UNTAC was a necessary bridge connecting the four factions, and it was an important catalyst leading to democracy. The Authority was a guarantor of domestic peace and tranquillity during the fragile transitional period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Asked about the cooperation of the Khmer Rouge, Mr Akashi said the forthcoming report of the Secretary-General would touch on that subject. There had been a positive change in the attitude of the Khmer Rouge, which had stated on 20 April that UNTAC could visit five areas under its control on certain designated dates. That development had been welcome, but the Authority would not be satisfied until it had unconditional access at all times to all areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The initial assessed budget for the Authority had been $1.9 billion for its entire mandate, the Special Representative said in reply to another question. Last week, following a review of the assessed budget, it had been reduced to slightly less than $1.8 billion, not including funds for repatriation and rehabilitation, which would be raised on a voluntary basis. The budget would be reassessed for the second six-month period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Akashi said there were currently 4,000 troops deployed in Cambodia, including a significant air contingent from France, a communications unit from Australia, two infantry battalions from Malaysia and Indonesia, as well as two engineering battalions from China and Thailand, among others. Other units were on their way. Approximately 200 civilian police had been deployed. The civilian police target was 3,600. The Authority sought full deployment of 15,600 troops by June.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where was Pol Pot? a correspondent asked. Mr Akashi said he had no information in that regard. He had never met Pol Pot; he was regularly in touch with two senior officials of that faction, including General Son San. There was speculation that Pol Pot might be on the Thai-Cambodian border.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To a question on contributions, Mr Akashi said Sadako Ogata, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), said she had received pledges of $60 million for the repatriation effort. Towards the end of June, there would be a conference in Tokyo on Cambodian recovery, which would be co-chaired by the Japanese Foreign Minister, Michio Watanabe, and William H. Draper III, Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). Mr Akashi said he and Prince Sihanouk would attend the opening session of the meeting, which would be held at the ministerial level. Organisers were "pretty confident" that the conference would identify adequate financial support for Cambodian rehabilitation needs. Much work remained to be done. The Asian Development Bank last week took an important positive decision in Hong Kong with regard to aiding Cambodia, he added.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Akashi said he hoped that, in a week or two, it would be possible to publish the report of the recent mission on the economic and financial situation in Cambodia, which would contain recommendations on how to cope with over-expenditure and lack of revenues in the Government. That had been an inter-agency mission, involving UNDP, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. Such coordination was of the utmost importance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Asked about United States compliance with approval of the Authority's budget, the Special Representative said he would be travelling to Washington, DC, on Wednesday, to meet with Congressional leaders and State as well as Defense Department representatives. He said he generally felt that those leaders and representatives were largely satisfied with the work of UNTAC, which was necessary to the establishment of peace, national reconciliation and democracy so badly needed in Cambodia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The views of several Member States had been taken into account and had resulted in the reduction of the number of computers required for the elections process, he said. The Authority sought to be as economical as possible, but in order to be credible, a minimum presence was required. Hardly any physical infrastructure existed in Cambodia, the roads were in bad shape, bridges had been destroyed and airports were badly damaged. The Authority's engineering units were repairing and sometimes constructing the country's infrastructure. The budget, which might have seemed large, was not, in view of those needs. The per capita income of Cambodians was estimated to be $100 per year, which was half that of Viet Nam and less than one tenth that of Thailand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to another question, Mr Akashi said the visit to China by SNC representatives had not impeded work. He had been in touch with Prince Sihanouk by fax at the time. China had been very helpful in inviting SNC members to Beijing, and had dealt with the four factions in an even-handed manner, demonstrating its will for the implementation of the Paris Accords. The trip had not been a waste of time; press criticisms of it had been too harsh.</PARA>

<PARA>The reason for moving this urgency motion in the Senate today is that the most efficient and productive method of getting work done in Australia is under threat. That method is the current contract system. It is under threat because a company known as Troubleshooters, which had initiative or what is commonly known as get-up-and-go, established a contract system that would improve the output of the work force in this country, and the efficiency and productivity of many industries; put more profit into business; and, most importantly, increase the take-home pay of individuals. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UW4">Senator CRANE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a good question. Where is he? The proposals which have been widely circulated to industry are being run under the guise of tackling the issue of sham contractors. This is nonsense. Their position is already protected in law through the Trade Practices Act. Secondly, it is protected by the individuals themselves who do not have to enter into a contract. The proposals have wide reaching ramifications for industry. They will lead to lower productivity and huge increases in cost, and will be damaging to the Australian economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current contract system has stood the test of time in almost every industry one can mention, the most notable being the housing or cottage industry, agriculture, mining, transport and, of course, a myriad of others. The current system allows individuals to actually assess a task by using their initiative and wit and then get on with doing the job as quickly and as efficiently as possible. It allows them to maximise their skills and increase their capacity to increase their own income. It has served Australia well and will continue to do so providing that the Government, the unions and the Australian Industrial Relations Commission keep out of the way. If the system is changed, as the Minister advocates, it will increase disputation, remove flexibility and interfere with the rights of individuals to freely determine how they are going to operate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister consistently runs the line that change is necessary because of sham contractors. The fact is that we now have a sham Minister who is an apologist for certain elements in the trade union movement in this country, in particular the Building Workers Industrial Union. The evidence shows quite clearly that the instructions to change the current contract system have come about as a result of the Troubleshooters case which was heard before Justice Woodward of the Federal Court, then the full bench of the Federal Court and, finally, the High Court of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the High Court decision on 7 June 1991, just 11 months ago, the Minister&mdash;or, should I say, the apologist for the trade union movement&mdash;described the law as an ass. Not only does he not accept the decisions of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission when they do not suit him, but he is now moving to undermine the decisions of the Federal Court and the High Court of this country because their decisions do not suit his union masters and their hidden agenda, which is to increase union membership and union domination at the expense of a proven system of efficiency and productivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To prove this point I quote from a letter of 4 May 1990 by Tom McDonald, the National Secretary of the Builders Workers Industrial Union. In that letter, amongst other things, Mr McDonald stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Past experience shows that where workers work as self-employed subcontractors, it is impossible to effectively unionise or organise those workers. That is why the New Right is pushing the self-employed subcontract arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr McDonald further stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The trade union movement must close ranks to ensure that this type of agreement does not become a precedent for the introduction of enterprise bargaining which is not underpinned by the award wage and conditions of employment.</PARA>
<PARA>I quote from a letter from Mr Vince Raffa, Secretary of the Victorian Branch of the BWIU, which was sent to every member of the union. The letter stated two things. It stated firstly that, because of the union's loss in courts and subsequent damages paid to Troubleshooters, each and every member was to be levied to pay. Secondly, and more importantly, Mr Raffa stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have also been vindicated by the fact that the Federal Government has announced its intention to pass legislation making Troubleshooters Available type arrangements illegal by changing the Federal Industrial Relations Act.</PARA>
<PARA>It is interesting to note that at least the Victorian Branch of the BWIU knew about this some two months before it was announced publicly.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I quote from a document from Stephen Rothman from HB Higgins Chambers. This was a legal opinion prepared for the BWIU. Amongst other things, that document states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There would also need to be a definition of the word `employee' in the following terms: employee means a person engaged under a Contract of Service (as defined) and employment has a corresponding meaning.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the true agenda of what the proposed legislation is about and the attempts to destroy the current contracting system. Almost every industry has rejected the decision to bring contractors under the jurisdiction of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Are their opinions to be ignored? Are they not important?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister has released a paper entitled,`Legislation Concerning the Independent Contractors'. The Minister has claimed that legitimate contractors&mdash;whatever that means&mdash;and, in particular, the housing industry, will be quarantined. This is impossible, as legal advice shows. I quote legal advice from Gallons Crowley and Chamberlain. Terry Chamberlain stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed changes are very broad in scope, much broader in fact than Senator Cook has stated publicly. They are in no way limited to sham sub-contractors or to agreements that are harsh or unfair. Certainly they would cover the housing industry, despite the Senator's assurance.</PARA>
<PARA>I further quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Disputes about Independent Contractors</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the proposal, the definition of industrial dispute is to be amended to encompass disputes extending beyond the limits of any one state about the use or proposed use of independent contractors instead of employees to perform work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under this definition the jurisdiction of the AIRC is virtually limitless with regard to independent contractors. There is no quarantine for any particular industry or any particular subject of dispute.</PARA>
<PARA>I quote further from the same document. Under the heading `Union Membership' it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An independent contractor is by definition an independent businessman and entitled to employ others in the conduct of his business. Properly he should be represented by an employer association such as the HIA but lodgement of union membership for such a contractor is weak, although the motive is clear, that is, to extend union domain.

<PARA>This decision of the Government to interfere with the very efficient and productive system that operates in this country has far reaching ramifications. It is best summarised by Mr Geoff Wedgwood, Housing Industry Association economist, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If commercial building practices are enforced on the residential industry, costs would increase by 20 to 25 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>Legal advice shows quite clearly this will happen. This decision will make every industry in this country less competitive; it will remove initiative and interfere with the freedom of individuals to choose; it will mean business profits will drop, consumer prices will rise, and an individual's capacity to maximise his or her earnings will be reduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a fundamental test not only of the Minister to put Australia's efficiency and productivity first&mdash;and I might add, the Government's&mdash;but also of the Democrats to determine whether they wish to see building costs, housing costs, mining costs and farming costs go up; in fact, the full spectrum of all costs going up in this country and our being left less competitive&mdash;and, I might add, with disputation going up.

He wants to put that proposal into effect to give free rein to shonky subcontractors to deny workers justice and a real future in an important industry in this country. Press releases issued by the Master Builders Association on 1 April included figures that were totally incorrect. Neither that organisation nor the Housing Industry Association contacted the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) about the Government's proposals and consequently they have got things dead wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that no genuine contractor or employer using contactors will be affected by this proposal. Housing costs will not soar, as is claimed by those organisations. We are not touching the present arrangements in the industry relating to genuine subcontractors. The legislation is aimed solely at sham contractors; people who call themselves contractors and work as employees for lower pay or without basic rights such as annual leave, sick leave, superannuation and occupational health and safety considerations.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition's motion is rubbish. The proposed legislation will provide the opportunity for subcontract workers to seek and achieve justice. The legislation is aimed particularly at harsh and unfair contracts and sham contractors. It will have no effect on genuine contracts or the efficiency, productivity, quality and costs of genuine contract agreements in any industry. We will provide subcontractors with an efficient means to seek redress where they have been exploited, and to recover moneys owing to them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard the comment that there are situations that already provide for this. I will give some examples&mdash;some case histories. A worker was employed by company W from November 1991 through to and including 11 March 1992. He was told that his status during this period of employment was that of a legitimate subcontractor and he was paid $20 per hour. A prescribed payments system of taxation was applied. Upon lodging the complaint, he indicated that at no time did he want to work under this system. The company had told him that unless he worked by this method there was no employment for him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is conscription; employers forcing people to work under these sorts of conditions. The union approached the company in April 1992 and reached the following agreement: that all BUS and BERT contributions for his period of employment would be paid; the company would also pay the award provisions that the member did not receive&mdash;$1,000 in travelling time and fares, $1,500 pro rata annual leave, $640 for statutory holidays and rostered days off, a total of $6,000 in four months. That is what the worker was denied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In another case person B was employed from 22 March 1988 to mid-1992&mdash;a longer period. He was paid and taxed under the prescribed payments system. During his period of employment he received no annual leave, no award allowances, no BUS or BERT&mdash;BERT being the Building Employees Retirement Trust&mdash;contributions and no other entitlements as per the award. The union approached the company in April 1992. A discussion with regard to taxation took place on site between a union official and person B. This is important&mdash;this is these honest contractors. Person B informed the official that during the four years that he had been employed by this company, and taxation had been deducted under the PPS, the employer had not forwarded any of these payments to the Australian Taxation Office. So much for these wonderfully honest and thoughtful people to whom Senator Crane referred. They are trying to introduce and maintain a system which exploits workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The union immediately stopped all work on the project and sat down to negotiations with the company. At the end of the negotiations, the following agreement was reached: the company would pay all outstanding taxation contributions which should have been paid&mdash;a sum of $46,500 which it had nobbled the Taxation Office for to that stage. In addition, it signed a statutory declaration saying that it accepted all liabilities for any fines and penalties placed upon person B. That indemnified person B against any prosecution by the Australian Taxation Office for the company's wrongdoing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the company would pay the member a sum of $15,000 for those award entitlements he did not receive during his period of employment. The hourly rate received by this person over the employment period fluctuated between $14 per hour and $20 per hour. They are just two examples and there are others. For instance, in Queensland there is an agreement called the resilient floor layers agreement. It covers rates of pay for carpet layers and resilient floor layers. Person C was working under award rates of pay during his period of employment with two companies. This person was employed for some time by both companies and towards the end of the employment was elevated to the status of supervisor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In short, the person was never paid in accordance with the agreement. He was also forced to provide his own accommodation and transportation when sent into country areas. He did not receive BUS or BERT contributions or any other entitlements that would have applied under the award. The union placed bans and limitations to get the employer to the negotiating table. So much for these agreements and the subcontractors who will do wonderfully well out of them. Employers have to be forced to comply with payments through industrial disputes that nobody wants. The final result was that the sum of $15,000 was agreed between the parties to be paid to the worker after some deductions had been made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are just three stated examples. They are specific cases, not this airy-fairy stuff of somebody's legal opinion&mdash;though legal opinions are important. The Queensland branch of the union which negotiated these recoveries estimated that, out of approximately $1.5m recovered for members, 40 per cent of the cases were similar to those three cases. Many other cases would not see the light of day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An important point for the Australian Democrats to consider is that the genuine subcontractors who will benefit from the provisions of this legislation are small business people. The Democrats see them as part of their constituencies. They are now effectively denied redress because their only appeal against abuse of the contract system is through the civil law system. That road leads to huge delays and massive costs. It is no answer. There is no effective redress under the Commonwealth jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that a recent contract has been offered to people in Tasmania. This was also dealt with by some legal analysis. One particular clause says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is clear that the contractor has full liability for all damage however arising to the company, its officers, employees or agents which arises out of the performance of the services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, if the contractor provides some services and for some unforeseeable reason one of the company's employees is injured in an accident which is in some way connected with the provision of those services the contractor would be solely liable to the company employee regardless of whether that contractor is liable in negligence.</PARA>
<PARA>A further example of the far-reaching effects of the clause is that, if a contractor provides services and for some unforeseeable reason the employee of another contractor of the company is injured for whatever reason which is in some way connected with the services provided, the contractor would be liable to that other contractor's employee, regardless of whether he was liable in negligence or otherwise. So much for the protection that people get. Employees get protection under normal working conditions under an award. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now go to the issue of the housing section. There is nothing new in these proposals; they already exist in many States. Many building licensing boards have introduced various forms of tribunals to resolve disputes between builders and subcontractors over payments and moneys owing. Even the Greiner Government in its industrial relations legislation left intact the provisions for a similar tribunal in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trade union movement and the Labor Government are committed to an economy which operates with the optimum of efficiency and with world-class standards of performance. This is the basis of the micro-economic reform agenda being pursued by the Government. As an example, examine the efficiency of the commercial building sector. By world standards it is highly efficient, but under the construction industry development strategy the Commonwealth and the States are working with industry and unions to further improve results. They are not satisfied. They are sitting down doing something about it, not suggesting the continuation of some system that will destroy that opportunity for a better future. </PARA>

All parties to this strategy are confident that it will lead to further reform.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only this morning I was talking to an officer of a very large construction company about this legislation. He made points to me that I believe are fairly sensible and intelligent. He said that the Government is seeking to avoid exploitation of loopholes in the arrangements between employees and employers as they genuinely stand. While a lot can be said about the cost of labour, I would point out that it is at a figure of about 25 per cent in some areas, and down to 15 per cent in others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important relationship in the industry is between the client and the main contractor, between the contractor and the subcontractors and between employer and employees. This is a long term relationship and it promises to be more productive than has been the case in the past. It is about the production process&mdash;productivity improvements, total quality management and training&mdash;so that we can equate with the clever country. I have been in the trade union movement a long time and I do not know of any subcontractors&mdash;subcontractors of the type that Senator Crane seeks to defend&mdash;who have ever trained anybody in the industry; if they did, it was probably for a couple of days to do a particular job so that they could make a larger profit. </PARA>

That is a fairly good accomplishment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A simple way of looking at issues such as this is to use a question and answer process. We may ask the question: will the legislation change the nature of the contracting system? The answer is no, because those working as genuine independent contractors or subcontractors will still get paid on results, for example, per item, per metre, et cetera, as against an employee who is paid on a time basis. This means that the incentive for productivity will not change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next question to be asked is: who will be affected? The answer is: those employers who seek to classify employees as contractors or subcontractors for the purpose of avoiding their legal obligations to their employees and who seek to undermine genuine independent subcontractors who observe their legal obligations to their employees. They are the ones who will be affected most. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what it is about&mdash;reducing wage rates and reducing the take-home pay for ordinary workers so that more and more profit can go into the coffers of those employers who do not care about the long term future of the industry and this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is the legislation necessary? That is a good question. Senator Crane suggests that it is not necessary. The answer is: to clarify and give recognition and protection both to both bona fide contractors and to employees, due to the fact that some shonky operators are forcing workers to engage in sham arrangements designed to undermine community standards under the guise of `contracting' or `subcontracting'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How will it affect costs? It will reduce costs in many instances and will increase costs only where the employer is paying less than the community standard, as determined by the Industrial Relations Commission after hearing all the evidence. Surely people are entitled to a minimum wage for the work that they do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How will it reduce costs? Senator Crane, and Senator Kemp particularly, would be interested in this. It will produce better quality work which will reduce consumer complaints in regard to shoddy workmanship which leads to higher maintenance costs. How many times, as a result of shoddy workmanship, have we seen cases of a product being delivered and there being no end of problems developing over a period? We seek to build the quality into the building by the use of good practices in terms of training and total quality control. It will allow better training of apprentices, which will protect the long term skill base of the industry. It is an accepted fact that the current system has caused the virtual collapse of the apprenticeship system in the housing industry. The housing industry will have less turnover of labour and will therefore retain a greater number of its skilled personnel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where will this measure increase costs? Only where the Industrial Relations Commission determines that the payments are less than community standards. This will protect the legitimate builders and contractors by civilising the shonky operators, as difficult as that may be. Maybe the Opposition believes we should pay anybody as little money as we can get away with. It does not care that people do not have a reasonable living standard for the ones they love and the people around them. It does not care about the community in general getting benefits. It is the distribution of wealth that is important. The Opposition wants to distribute it to the rich people in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The housing industry predicts that the cost of a house will go up by $25,000. The answer to that is that it will not. Research done in past years shows that, of construction costs in the cottage industry, labour represents only 24 per cent. Of the mortgage dollar, labour costs represent only 6 per cent, which includes the cost of finance, land, materials and profit besides labour. Since this research was done, technology has increased, further reducing labour costs while land prices and material prices have generally gone up. The Opposition does not worry about people who buy land and exploit the public by making huge profits out of it as it appreciates in value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Will this measure increase industrial disputation? That is something the Opposition is always raving on about. No, it will reduce it because it will provide an independent body, the AIRC, to prevent and resolve any disputes. In other words, it will provide an independent forum, instead of the current situation where subcontractors have to either let the shonky builder rob him&mdash;and they do&mdash;or go to the union and fight it out in the field. But the Opposition wants to destroy the unions so that the workers have no representations. That is its attitude. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Will it increase unionisation? The Opposition will love this answer. No, because similar legislation in different States has not by itself increased unionisation. The legislation might reduce unionisation, as the subcontractors will have somewhere to go&mdash;to the Industrial Relations Commission&mdash;to resolve their problems whereas now they can only go to the trade unions. Will the legislation give unions the right to recruit subcontractors? Is this legislation new? No, there is similar legislation in many States. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The existing sub-contracting tradition in the building industry is not in any way a "sham", but represents a very important, efficient and productive sector of the industry.</PARA>
<PARA>I agree with that, as would Senator Macdonald, with the addition of two words at the front so that it reads, `Most of the existing subcontracting tradition in the building industry is not in any way a sham'. The trouble with the original motion proposed by Senator Crane is that it is an absolute. It has in it the definite article `the' meaning the subcontracting industry in total is a wonderful thing. I can assure him&mdash;and I can assure the Senate&mdash;that it certainly is not. In making that assurance I will say that the housing industry is characterised by a most efficient and effective system which has grown up in a tradition of `That's the way to do it'. It has become most effective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the reasons for the growth of that tradition are related to the geography of the industry. The very fact that the sites of operation are by definition temporary and located away from each other has meant that individual methods&mdash;in other words, independent methods&mdash;have grown up to suit the site and location of the enterprise and the individual needs of the owner. Because of that, we have had the development over many decades of what is now in most cases&mdash;that is what I am emphasising, `most cases'&mdash;a very efficient and productive aspect of Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, not all housing industry participants are lilywhite and not all of those engaged in subcontracting are pure in their business practices. Through the very diversity that I am speaking about&mdash;through its geography&mdash;the housing industry obviously provides opportunities for unprincipled operators to exploit those who work as contractors. That is as much a result of the size of the industry as well.

No organisations, no body in particular, made it their business to safeguard my interests. I suggest that there remain many other examples of the situation which I suffered at that time.

The company, TNT, decided on the amount of the monthly repayments, made arbitrary deductions from the person's earnings and gave him less and less subcontract work. The truck had been sold on the basis that subcontract work would be made available exclusively to the new truck owner. Once that person was unable to keep up the repayments, guess what? TNT repossessed the vehicle. The contract, of course, was labelled, and found to be, unfair. </PARA>

I was very much taken by Senator Burns's moving and passionate speech in which he talked about harsh and unfair treatment of workers and genuine contractors or employers not being affected by the proposal of the Government. He said that the legislation is aimed solely at sham contractors. That sounded familiar to me. In fact, it sounded rather like a press release that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) put out on, of all days, April Fools' Day, 1 April 1992. It was Senator Burns who was the April Fool and anybody who believes Senator Burns and gets suckered in by this sort of nonsense coming from the Minister for Industrial Relations is the April Fool.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sad fact is that this is nothing more than a cynical exercise at power grabbing by the union bully boys in Australia. Senator Crane made this very clear in his address. He read from a letter written to members of the Victorian Building Workers Industrial Union by Mr Vince Raffa. I  repeat a sentence from that letter for the benefit of the Senate and those people who might be listening:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have also been vindicated by the fact that the Federal Government has announced its intention to pass legislation making the Troubleshooters Available type arrangements illegal by changing the Federal Industrial Relations Act.</PARA>
<PARA>This letter is saying that they were not vindicated by the Federal Court. This matter went to the highest court in the land, right up to the High Court, which said that these arrangements were legal. I will come to the judgment in a second, but the judgment said that these arrangements were also very fair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the objection of the union leaders if these arrangements are both legal and fair? The union leaders' objection is not based on the best interests of the worker or of unionists, because everybody who is involved in Troubleshooters Available was a unionist. This is all about a grab for power. They are trying to further strengthen the arm of the union movement and make a mockery of existing arrangements between people in the building industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this proposal from Senator Cook would do is quite frightening. If there is a dispute about the contract terms&mdash;and it talks about the erection of a frame for a house or the laying of bricks for a house&mdash;instead of that dispute between a contractor and a subcontractor going to a court, it will go to the Industrial Relations Commission. Notwithstanding that the dispute may be about whether the frame was erected in the right place or the bricks were laid in the right fashion, instead of going to a court of law for the dispute to be determined because it is a contract, it will be sent to the Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today the people on the other side of the chamber are saying that the Federal Court is not good enough to look after building contracts and does not seem to know enough about building contracts to look after disputes between contractors and subcontractors. Those opposite believe that the whole matter will be sent to the Industrial Relations Commission, notwithstanding the fact that the Industrial Relations Commission does not know a thing about building contracts. That is the problem caused by the lack of logic on the other side of the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it an efficient means of redressing problems to give it all to the Building Workers Industrial Union, when already there is a sanction against harsh and unconscionable contracts under the Trade Practices Act? Also there is State legislation  that prohibits unfair contract terms. Yet that is not good enough for the Government. It wants to impose its own unfair contract terms and unfairly oblige everybody involved in the building industry to join a union whether they like it or not. That is what it is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It all boils down to the fact that the Government is trying to get its hands on some more money to bolster its campaign coffers before the next Federal election. The Government is saying, `Let's press-gang some more people and make them unionists so that we have enough money to fight the next Federal election'. That is the effect of this legislation and that is what the Government does not have the courage to tell this chamber today. </PARA>

The second thing is that they have deleted the bit at the end of the motion that says that the existing contract system should be further promoted and expanded in its current form to help Australian industry become internationally competitive and not restricted as proposed by the Minister for Industrial Relations. The Democrats' amendment takes all that out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats are not interested in becoming internationally competitive, not only in the building industry but in any other industry. Worse still, they are clearly not going to stand up to the Minister for Industrial Relations and his legislation. They do not come out and say, `We are going to vote with the Government'. They do not have the courage to say that or to come before the Senate and say, `We will stand by Senator Cook and sink or swim with him'. They want to appear as if they are interested in getting something, but will still go over and stand with Senator Cook, anyway. That is why we feel that the amendment moved by the Democrats is wholly unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us get down to the real crux of this debate or the real unconscionability of what this Government wants to do. For example, a person who is an independent contractor is probably a member of the Housing Industry Association. But if the Government has its way, that person will be forced to be a union member. Quite simply, if a person is a subcontractor, eventually they will be required to become a union member. But it will turn that person into a paranoid schizophrenic, because on one side they will be a member of the HIA and on the other side a member of the Building Workers Industrial Union. Which hat will they put on? It will certainly not be a hard hat because they will be too busy shuffling between the HIA hat and the union hat. They will not even know where to find the hard hat, because the Government is being hard on all the people in this country who want to go out and determine their terms of employment for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is so wrong with people having freedom of choice as to how and when they work? What is so offensive to individual liberty about that? Nothing at all, but it offends the sensibilities of Minister Cook and his cronies on the other side of the chamber, who are dreadfully afraid of what it would do to their mates in the union movement. The bottom line is that most Australian workers are heartily sick and tired of the men in suits in the Industrial Relations Commission determining for them how, where and when they will work. If real economic reform is to be achieved in this economy and in making this nation more productive, the only way to do so is by putting the decision making power in the hands of the employers and employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is any doubt about the ethical righteousness of that, I refer Government members to a speech I heard this morning made by Father Usher, who addressed the Parliamentary Christian Fellowship and who works with the Catholic Social Welfare Council. He said that we need to put more of the decision making power in the hands of the employer and the employee, and that this confrontationist approach that those opposite wish to support is just not on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that the Government is so dreadfully afraid of workers being able to determine for themselves how they are going to work. It is so dreadfully afraid that the people who were once kept as minions of the union movement will suddenly have some say or choice in their lives that it has brought in this heinous legislation to take away the rights of those people. I say to Senator Giles, Senator Burns and some of their socialist friends on the other side of the chamber&mdash;the revolution is coming, comrades! The revolution is almost upon us, because the real revolution is to put the power in the hands of the workers rather than in the hands of the unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is something the Government has never been able to understand because it has never been able to understand the mentality of the ordinary working man or woman. That is clearly shown in the fact that this is the Government that has put almost one million ordinary men and women out of work. It just does not understand the fact that some people want to work. Some people want to work hard, some people want to be productive and some people do not want to be under the yoke of the union movement. This is nothing more than a cynical ploy to extend the power of Martin Ferguson and Bill Kelty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We already have the mechanisms in the Trade Practices Act to ensure that there is no exploitation and that there is no harshness, unfairness or unconscionableness. I ask the Government senators sitting opposite: what is wrong with the Federal Court? What is wrong with the High Court? What is wrong with the highest court in the land determining the rights of employers and employees? Instead of having the High Court of Australia, the highest judicial body in this country, Senator Cook and the Government would give us the Clayton's court, the Industrial Relations Commission&mdash;and a poor parody of the High Court that is indeed. The Government does not want to have judicial determination. It wants to have determination by the Industrial Relations Commission. If I were in a jam, if I were in a dispute and I wanted a fair, decent and impartial determination of my problem, I would much rather go to the Federal Court or the High Court any day of the week than to the Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us get it very clear to the Government. We on this side of the chamber stick by the judicial system in this country. We are not in for lynch mobs. We stick by the fair, judicial process and by the right of every man and woman in this nation, no matter who they are, where they work or what job they do, to go before a court and have their problems sorted out rather than before some commission, which is basically a sham court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So let us get down to the basic facts. The Government is dreadfully afraid. It is dreadfully afraid of losing the election. That is why it wants to rush this legislation into place. It is dreadfully afraid of what will happen if people actually get the choice as to whether they are going to be unionists or free people. This Government is dreadfully afraid that the revolution is coming and it is missing out. I put to the Government that, come the glorious day, the people of this country will vote with their feet.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With his usual athleticism, Senator O'Chee has been leaping to conclusions at a great rate. Most of his contribution to this debate has been hardly worth responding to. I do have some regrets in relation to Senator Crane and the fact that he has produced for us this afternoon such a pathetic matter for an urgency motion. Such an otherwise moderate and charming person seems to have somewhat of an obsession with industrial relations and, particularly, our Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook). I do not want to sound offensive, but I do say that if Senator Crane were somebody close to me I would be suggesting that he seek treatment. We have an excellent Minister with enormous commitment to fairness and equity. This is not surprising as a result of his own industrial experience over very many years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those of us who have dealt with good and bad employers and have a considerable amount of experience in the field know that legislation of the nature that is being proposed is absolutely necessary. There are many examples of workers who are not employees in the strict legal sense but who are in an extremely vulnerable position with minimal bargaining power. We should not have to explain to those opposite who those workers are and in which industries they work, but they do tend to be people without formal skills and with very little bargaining power: the young, women who have returned to the work force perhaps or those who are in industries that are under stress at the moment. Those opposite must, if they are to be fair, admit that there are many cases where unscrupulous employers have sought to avoid award decisions. Those of us who worked in the industrial system dealt with them every day of our lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such employers try to avoid other provisions, as Senator Bell has so graphically described. I have some examples, too, of workers who are styled as independent contractors. We are concerned about the fact that, in many cases, people who are not genuinely entrepreneurs are vulnerable to whatever conditions an employer would like to impose upon them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's policies are aimed at ensuring that such workers are protected from unfair practices. That protection would come in through the award system, not via the Trade Practices Act or any other piece of legislation which, to the vast majority of workers, are totally arcane. Even to a person of the education, sophistication and skills of Senator Bell, I would suggest that the last protection he would have thought of achieving would be through Acts which are not directly in the minds of the majority of people associated with industrial issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition wants to remove the protection of the award system by setting up an opting-in arrangement where the employer can veto the worker's desire to be covered by an award system. Of course, the Opposition raises, as one would expect, the bogie of this legislation compulsorily requiring all workers to become unionised. That is absolutely not so. If those opposite read the material with which they have been provided, they will find that allowing independent contractors to join a federally registered union is not novel. Some independent contractors may do so now. In addition, a union will not be able to seek among independent contractors a wider class of members than it may seek amongst employees under existing law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The protection available to independent contractors under the Act will continue to apply and is to be extended to make it clear that an independent contractor may not be compelled to join a union, nor discriminated against on account of membership or non-membership of a union. Genuinely independent contractors will not be made into employees and will not be subjected to the award system generally. The unfair contracts review procedure is a more limited procedure than that which is now available under some State laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is just an example of the abysmal ignorance of the people on the other side of this chamber and their approach to industrial relations as if somehow or other it were not real law: to get real law, one, for some strange reason, seems to be required to go to Federal courts. Industrial law has every bit as much legitimacy as any other law in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Opposition, too, that such a procedure, the one we are discussing, has existed in New South Wales for many years and has recently, amazingly perhaps, been carried over by the Greiner Government into its New South Wales Industrial Relations Act 1991&mdash;maybe one of the only really useful pieces of that Act in a sense of fairness and equity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The procedure proposed will operate only in respect of a limited class of unfair contracts. That brings me back to a point which needs to be made again and again. We are not targeting genuine contractors, genuine entrepreneurs. We are targeting those cases where vulnerable workers are in a position where they simply cannot achieve, under existing law in some parts of Australia at particular times and under particular circumstances, the protection that will give them proper wages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The claim that housing costs will necessarily rise because of the Government's proposal is rejected. Senator Crane should just think about that. That would be true only if currently there was massive exploitation in the housing industry; that is, if subcontractors in this area are currently subsidising to a large extent builders or house owners. If that is what Senator Crane is saying, there will be a change.

It is also wrong to assume that any basis will exist for intervention in the housing area by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. All of the evidence suggests that there would be few non-genuine, exploitative contract arrangements. But, for the people who were vulnerable to those few exploitative contract arrangements, legislation of this sort is absolutely essential.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I give just a few examples of how this exploitation works. For every individual, it is a disaster, even if there are not hundreds of thousands of them. But in some industries very large numbers of people are vulnerable to the&mdash;we do not seem to want to use the word `sham' this afternoon; `spurious' might be a useful word&mdash;spurious arrangements under which they are forced to work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first case concerns the clothing industry and involves the creation of a limited partnership between 22 former employees and a particular trust company. The agreement appeared to be a sham&mdash;sorry, spurious&mdash;with the evidence casting a real doubt about whether the relationship of master and servant had been destroyed. The agreement, which was not registered under State law, provided that management decisions relating to the control of persons manufacturing garments were not exercised by the so-called ex-employees, the workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each of the ex-employees was paid a weekly amount equivalent to the wage mentioned in the award, which was said to be drawings on anticipated profits&mdash;a spurious approach. The provisions for expulsion from the partnership were similar to the right to terminate employment. So in every respect these people were working under conditions similar to those that would be in their awards, but they were forced into accepting all the other disadvantages that come with not being designated as employees. The decision in this case was that all partners and associate corporate entities were ordered to carry out all terms and conditions of the award&mdash;unlike the situation that poor Senator Bell was subjected to, with a lack of sick leave, annual leave and all the rest of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another example from the clothing industry involves a worker who was sewing women's summer nightdresses. She was paid 50c per nightdress. Quite obviously, she was an outworker. This is just one example out of probably hundreds of thousands of workers. She said, `Because the items were quite complex and the prices low I had to work reasonably hard to make up reasonable wages'. At 50c a nightdress, one can just imagine. She was required to have a business name. In the Industrial Commission she was awarded underpayments of $12,852. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another example, this time from the cleaning industry, involves a Miscellaneous Workers Union case. A husband and wife were employed as cleaners of four food stores. They were told by their employer that if they did not buy a franchise right to clean the four stores for $19,170 they would lose their job. They bought the franchise and were paid a monthly fee of $3,360.50. In other words, they worked for nearly six months without being paid. Their work was subject to continuous detailed supervision by the man who sold them the franchise agreement. On that count alone they certainly were not genuine entrepreneurs. The allegation was that the contract was harsh, unfair, unconscionable and against the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In settlement of the matter registered with the court, the husband and wife received underpayments based on the appropriate award rate for cleaners of $34,000 for one year's work. One might say, `That is excellent. The system is working'. I wonder whether Senator Crane, who is just leaving, knows how many more people there are out there who do not know about the Trade Practices Act and who are simply terrified of not being employed at all and who, at this stage, simply do not have the protection to which they are entitled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another example comes from the club industry in New South Wales. In this case the club had originally argued that the applicant who drove the bus for the club's free transport service was an independent contractor. The club conceded on appeal that the driver was an employee. He had been paid at $5 an hour initially and later at $6 an hour, which was about half the award rate. The employer was ordered to pay the applicant the sum of $19,796.34. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could go on and on with examples of this nature. But I emphasise that these are the very few that surface within the current industrial arbitration system where the system is able to provide relief for the individual who has been exploited. Sometimes these individuals have been exploited for quite long periods, at considerable expense to themselves, and in many cases they feel that to make any complaint at all would be to lose employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here is an example from the building industry just to show that it is not absolutely squeaky clean. I emphasise again that it is not only the building industry, and probably not principally the building industry, that is targeted by this proposal. An excavation company was a subcontractor on seven sites around Sydney using a pool of workers on an on-call basis. Workers were subjected to exploitation including a very low wage rate, no workers' compensation, no superannuation, no redundancy coverage and no issue of tax receipts. The company often employed workers with no previous on-site experience, thus increasing occupational health and safety risks. We would say that it was a complete disaster in industrial and occupational safety terms. The Building Workers Industrial Union was asked to intervene on behalf of the workers. A total of $70,000 was recovered on behalf of members of the BWIU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another case study involved contractors who avoided meeting their award obligations by paying their workers on an `all-in' basis, thereby avoiding payment of travel money and overtime, and redundancy provisions and workers' compensation. It is exactly the sort of thing that is happening in New Zealand now, and it is exactly the sort of thing that the coalition would like to see in Australia under its industrial relations policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition is not interested in finding ways of resolving disputes through industrial tribunals and protecting workers who are least able to organise and protect themselves. It is not interested in equity; it is interested only in slamming a quite good industrial relations system, albeit one which could do with improvement. But this is the whole reason for having it. The Opposition has no difficulty with arrangements that undermine awards or permit exploitative arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In essence, that is the Opposition's underlying position. It is an extraordinary belief that without any statutory protection or legislative award standards&mdash;in fact, without any regulation whatsoever&mdash;workers, whether contractors or employees, will prosper and never be exploited. We know that is not the case. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the motion before the Senate that has been moved by my colleague Senator Crane. Senator Crane has so well summarised this issue that we are debating. Basically, Senator Cook's proposed Bill intends to destroy the system of contracting as we know it today. The Bill intends to completely reverse the decisions of the Federal Court, the Full Court, the Full Bench and the High Court of Australia. It intends to remove the employer's right to manage and the employee's right to decide the terms and conditions that he or she is prepared to work under.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no dispute as to what the industrial relations, fiscal, taxation and other policies of Paul Keating will produce. We do not have to have a sort of wide-ranging hypothesis or have to refer to other countries. We in Australia know exactly what the Labor Government's policies produce when they are imposed. We know of their effect on employment, on living standards and on the overall social cohesion of this society. We know that the policies of Senator Giles's Government&mdash;those which Senator Giles has so assiduously supported and, again in her remarks today, continues to support&mdash;have produced over one million unemployed. There was no mention in Senators Giles's remarks today about those people who&mdash;let us face it&mdash;have had their living standards dramatically slashed. When talking about living standards we should think particularly, I believe, about those people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under Keating's policies, what has happened to the living standards of those who are currently employed?  Hopefully, Senator Sherry, in his remarks, will answer that question. We know that the living standards of the Australian worker and the average Australian family have declined during the last four years under Keating's policies. So I say, as Senator Giles leaves the chamber, we know exactly what her Government's policies produce. We do not have to speculate about the future. Labor policies produce falling living standards and high and growing levels of unemployment. They are policies which have led to the devastation of industry around this country and have prevented major project after major project getting off the ground. As I say, we have now had some nine years of hard Labor under Paul Keating, and we know what Labor policies produce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I found Senator Bell's remarks particularly interesting. Senator Bell comes from a party which was essentially established to assist small business. The historical origins of the Australian Democrats draw very heavily on small business and the small business orientation created by their founder, former Senator Don Chipp, and they were continually endorsed until recent times by previous leaders of the Australian Democrats and previous spokespersons for the industrial relations area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major thrusts of the policies of the Australian Democrats up to about 1987&mdash;in recent years it has become extremely equivocal&mdash;was to encourage workers in their rights to reach individual agreements with their employers. It is not surprising that the massive protest meeting held in the Collingwood Town Hall this week to protest against this Bill that Senator Cook is proposing&mdash;who do honourable senators think was chairing the meeting?&mdash;was chaired by former Senator Don Chipp. If he has tuned in today and reads very carefully the Democrats' amendment to attempt to restrict the particular ambit of this urgency motion, I think that he, like many people out there in the community, will be sorry that, when put to the test, the Australian Democrats of today have again supported big unions. Senator Kernot will be tested in the next week or so on this particular issue. We will see the way that Senator Kernot comes down on compulsory superannuation. </PARA>

That is what she should be frightened of&mdash;that is what I am frightened of&mdash;and that is what Senator Bell should be frightened of.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Each time the Australian Democrats have been tested as to whether they will go down the road of supporting Senator Cook, big Labor, big unions and Bill Kelty, in recent years they have preferred to travel down that road with those people following those policies which have done so much damage to Australian business, to the living standards of Australian workers, and to employment in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to ask ourselves: why is it in this country that we have to have effectively the most centralised, regulated labour market in the Western world?  What is so special about Australian people that we have to so tightly regulate all their working awards and conditions? Why is it not possible, as in so many other countries, for them to have the right to settle their own working arrangements with their employers?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was very interesting that Senator Giles today raised the issue of New Zealand. If Senator Giles had turned to page 2 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, she would have noticed an article which was headed, `NZ deregulation brought dramatic improvements for Comalco', and, `Smelter rejoices in labour reform'. So what have some of the policies introduced in New Zealand done for the potential of New Zealand industry to grow, to create jobs and over the years to pay higher and higher wages to their workers?  This article tells us that in relation to what has happened in New Zealand basic labour productivity in this Comalco smelter has improved spectacularly. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The number of man-hours required to produce 1 tonne of aluminium dropped 31 per cent and was still declining.</PARA>
<PARA>The managing director of that particular plant said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comalco did not expect dramatic improvements in Australia&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>in contrast, I repeat, to New Zealand&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">while reform was limited to enterprise agreements&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>enterprise agreements of the nature as defined, of course, by the Labor Government. A focus on more fundamental New Zealand style reform was needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the troubling question: why is it in this country that we have to have an all-powerful trade union movement&mdash;one that, I think, in the eyes of many workers and those in the community, seems to be more interested in trying to run this country than in trying to protect the real interests and living standards of the ordinary Australian worker? This Bill is part of this particular thrust to try to entrench all powerful unionism in this country while other countries are moving away from these types of arrangements. That is precisely what it is doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see this in so many areas: the Government's attack on the AIRC; the compulsory superannuation levy; the Government's Bill to force amalgamations of trade unions against the wishes of many workers; and the Government's current attack on independent contractors. What does this pattern mean?  It means essentially that this Government is moving as fast and as hard as it can to try to entrench the power and privilege of the ACTU movement in this country. I believe that, after nine years of hard Labor, of falling living standards, of mounting unemployment, that particular approach to running this country has dramatically failed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is it that this Government is so scared of independent contractors? Why is it that this Government suddenly feels forced to bring in this particular Bill to attack practices which have long existed in this country? That is an interesting question. When the Troubleshooters case first emerged in the courts&mdash;remember that Troubleshooters have been around for quite a long period of time; this touches on what Senator Giles was saying as to whether independent contractors, as Senator Giles would have us believe, cut the living standards and the conditions of Australian workers&mdash;this is what an independent arbitrator, Mr Justice Woodward, said in the judgment on that case. I think this is worth noting and recording in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am satisfied from the evidence&mdash;particularly that of the men themselves&mdash;that workers who seek jobs through Troubleshooters, do so because it suits them to work in this way, rather than to obtain continuing employment with a builder. They are in no sense being exploited by Troubleshooters, nor do they represent a source of cheap labour for employers.</PARA>
<PARA>We have had allegations from Labor Party senators&mdash;I hope that Senator Cooney will not follow this line&mdash;that the independent contractor approach, the approach of free men and women to contract with their employers, automatically leads to a cut in wages, salaries and award conditions. On all the evidence, it does not. I am delighted that Senator Cook has at last come into the chamber. In many cases those who are working on the basis of an independent contract find that they are able to enjoy higher wages and salaries compared with those who are working under award conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that this is the real background to Senator Cook's proposal. The background is that the independent contractors are showing that this country, the free men and women in it, can well survive without the Bill Keltys of this world and the ACTU constantly poking their noses into their arrangements. That is why Bill Kelty and the ACTU are worried about this. It poses a major threat to trade unionism in this country, particularly unionism of the nature that has been developed in the last 10 years under Bill Kelty, the ACTU and this Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as I can see, the proposed Bill will cause widespread concern in the community. Senator Cook has already lit a torch; he has torched the prairie. I can assure Senator Cook that if he wants to pick a fight with small business in this country, he has chosen the wrong ground. The men and women of this country will not stand for the proposal which Senator Cook has brought before this chamber. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, freedoms so that people can negotiate between themselves. The case went to appeal and was considered by an eminent bench consisting of Justices Wilcox, Burchett and Ryan. The full bench gave its decision on 21 March, 1991 and said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">His Honour&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Justice Woodward&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">also found that the rates of pay offered to its workers were adjusted unilaterally each year by Troubleshooters without consultation with the workers who were nevertheless advised of each adjustment shortly before or immediately after it occurred.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the sort of thing that Senator Parer has said he is about; it is what Senator Parer, by way of interjection, has indicated he wants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose we come down to a difference of philosophy in this argument. It seems to me extraordinary that it is said&mdash;I am sure that Senator Cook would not agree with this; but it seems that the Opposition does&mdash;that where one side to an arrangement unilaterally adjusts the wages, that is consistent with the sorts of propositions that are being advanced that there should be exchanges on footings of equality between two parties, both of whom want that agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can Senator Parer possibly say that they have sat down and agreed upon wages when one party simply fixes the wage and says, `Take it or leave it'? That is the proposition Senator Parer is putting forward. Senator Parer has supported the proposition in the Troubleshooters case, as has Senator Crane. They are very eminent senators on the other side who  no doubt represent the position of the coalition on this matter. What is meant in the coalition's policy by agreement between workers and employers is where one side states what it will get and the other side takes it. That proposition appears from the very case that has led to the debate on this issue. The judges continue:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Justice Woodward&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">noted as well that the written contract between the Troubleshooters and its workers set out above did not include the whole of the terms of engagement because it contained no reference to the wet weather allowance, the six hours minimum pay or overtime provisions.</PARA>
<PARA>It is quite clear from that, certainly as far as the written agreements were concerned, that there was no attempt to set out in writing what was happening so that the worker could ascertain what was happening. Another part of the judgment, which has been put forward as gospel in this area, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the agreement that Troubleshooters are not to receive annual leave or sick leave or any payment referable to those entitlements and that no deduction of income tax is to be made from their remuneration signifies a mutual intention that they are not to be regarded as employees.</PARA>
<PARA>That was one of the tests that the court took in deciding whether they were employees in that instance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interesting thing is that this agreement has been put as the way forward. Under the agreement wages are fixed by one side, no annual leave or sick leave are provided for, the employee has to deduct his tax from the remuneration&mdash;he has to do all that work himself, and no payments are made for time taken off because the employee is sick or on holiday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When you look at that case, it takes on a different aspect to that which has been thrown on to it so far by those opposite. The other thing that ought to be said about that case is that it turned upon whether the people involved were either employees or subcontractors. The High Court would not have a full hearing on it because it said there were not points that required a decision on that issue. As Senator Crane would know, because he follows this closely, those subcontractors were doing exactly the same work as those who were employees. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All that this Bill that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) is proposing to bring in says is that if there are two groups of people, one of which contains subcontractors because of the legal arrangements made in respect of their work and the other one not, and they are doing the same work and being subject to the same rain and heat of the day when working, the independent contractors ought to be covered and given the same protection as the people who are doing exactly the same work next to them.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will begin with the last speaker, Senator Cooney. If he has done nothing else in his contribution&mdash;and he has done a lot more than that&mdash;he has confirmed what I said initially, which is that this proposed legislation in terms of the attack on our current contract system is really about the Troubleshooters case. Senator Cooney confirmed that quite clearly and highlighted a number of aspects with regard to that. For that I thank him. It is quite different from the position that has been put to us by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) in the material that has been released, where he has consistently said that it is about sham contracts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regardless of what those opposite say about Troubleshooters, its activity has been confirmed as being legal in the true sense of the word through Justice Woodward and then through the full bench of the Federal Court. The appeal that went to the High Court was disallowed because there was not sufficient evidence or reason for it to continue. In its analysis of the case the High Court confirmed what Justice Woodward and the full bench of the Federal Court had said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to deal with a number of aspects of the debate here today. The first relates to Senator Bell's amendment. It is rather sad that Senator Bell should put forward such an amendment because it is designed entirely to neuter or destroy the motion. In fact, I would question whether it really is an amendment. It borders very closely on being the opposite of the motion. Madam Acting Deputy President, perhaps you could rule on that at some future time, because I believe the amendment does not reflect the intent of the motion. As I understand it, amendments are not supposed to alter the meaning of a motion. This one certainly does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to some of my original comments on what this matter is about. If this proposed legislation were designed to catch sham contractors without having any impact on anyone else and did not affect the full spectrum of contracting that is operating in Australia, which has stood the test of time, then one could consider it very seriously. But that is not the situation. Senator Cooney has drawn that out quite clearly. It is also drawn out in the proposed amendments released by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) concerning independent contractors. It has been drawn out not by me but by legal opinion, some of which I quoted in my opening comments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will reiterate some of the points I made earlier. The proposed changes are very broad in scope, much broader than Senator Cook has stated publicly. They are in no way limited to sham subcontractors or to agreements that are harsh or unfair. Certainly they would cover the housing industry. The letter I have from Gallens Crowley &amp; Chamberlain states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Disputes about Independent Contractors</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the proposal, the definition of industrial dispute is to be amended to encompass disputes extending beyond the limits of any one state about the use or proposed use of independent contractors instead of employees to perform work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under this definition, the jurisdiction of the AIRC is virtually limitless with regard to independent contractors. There is no quarantine for any particular industry or any particular subject of dispute.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, a union might lodge a log of claims disputing an employer's use of independent contractors. This would constitute an industrial dispute.</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister knows full well, probably better than most in this place, how one goes about bringing on a dispute; he knows how it has been done in the past. Of course, under the proposals that have been publicly put out, it will be easy to bring on a dispute. Furthermore, that action in itself will virtually destroy the contracting system as we know it. Once again I emphasise that this is not my opinion, but that of Mr Terry Chamberlain of Gallens Crowley &amp; Chamberlain. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not imagining anything. The original briefing was Senator Cook's own paper. One cannot get a higher authority than that. The letter from Terry Chamberlain further states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Union Membership</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An independent contractor is by definition an independent businessman and entitled to employ others in the conduct of his business. Properly, he should be represented by an employer association such as the HIA. The lodging of union membership for such a contractor is weak, although the motive is clear, ie, to extend union domain. However, in terms of representation, such a move would establish the sub-contractor as schizophrenic&mdash;represented by and yet a potential supplicant to and adversary of unions and union demands&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>an impossible position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We reach the crux of this matter when we question why we need changes to legislation. There needs to be a purpose if the legislation is to be changed. One of the tests should be that the situation is not already covered. It is worth looking at this section of the letter from Terry Chamberlain which reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Lack of Need for Changes</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If, as Senator Cook states, the sole reason for the changes is to catch sham arrangements or unjust contracts, then the proposals are wholly unnecessary for the following reasons:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, if the concern is to save contractors from themselves and to regulate unjust contracts, recourse can be had to the Trade Practices Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) Secondly, if the concern is to catch sham arrangements designed to avoid award provisions, these arrangements are in fact already caught up by the existing Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The existing Act regulates the relationship between employers and employees. Whether the legal relationship of employer/employee exists is a question of law determined by the Court in accordance with certain well established indicia such as the degree of control exercised by the employer over the person performing the work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A person is therefore an employee or an independent contractor as a matter of fact regardless of how he is described. Any person who describes himself as an independent contractor but who is in fact an employee, is still governed by the current Act and there is no need for any amendment in order to catch these contracts.</PARA>
<PARA>That already exists in the current Act. One then has to look to the further agenda to see what this is really all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cooney put clearly to the Senate the position in regard to the Troubleshooters case. The other point that needs to be made is that the legislation is about extending union membership and union control. It is about picking up the flagging union membership which has quietly decreased over recent years. That also is a matter of fact. It is not a figment of my imagination or a matter of emotion, as one or two of the speakers have suggested. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to sum up my remarks by saying that the contract system has served this country extremely well. It has been an integral part of the Australian scene for the past 200 years. It has been a very important part of the development of this nation. It has been a very important part of the housing and cottage industry. It is probably the most important part of the transport industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will raise a couple of other points while the Minister rambles on, which is not unusual for him. I turn to the oncosts that exist in the housing industry. There is no question that under the current proposals the mechanism is there which would, in effect, include on-site considerations in terms of the cottage industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been informed that the labour component in building a house amounts to 25 per cent or thereabouts. What has been forgotten in the debate is the oncosts in the housing industry, such as the transport costs involved in getting material on site. Then there are the contract arrangements which exist in many parts of our timber industry for processing the timber, and a whole host of other matters. They have to be added into the total impact of building a house or whatever it might be. It is not just a case of breaking down individual aspects of what is being done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this amendment is passed, it will be a sad day for this nation&mdash;sad for its productivity, growth, opportunity and freedom of choice in terms of what people wish to do with their time and how they earn their money. It will also be a sad day for businesses because it will reduce their profit and their ability to employ. And it will be a sad day for those people involved in the contracting industry, because the net result will be that they have less disposable income in their pockets. For that reason, I urge Senator Bell to think very carefully about his amendment and to withdraw it. I do not believe that it is a correct amendment because Australia will be worse off if we have the type of interference that is proposed in our current contract system. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>This report on the administration of fringe benefits tax by the Australian Taxation Office is yet another in a series of Auditor-General's reports concerning the Australian Taxation Office which have been presented to the Senate. Each one of them has been very critical of the way in which the Australian Taxation Office has been conducting its own affairs. Yesterday, when I spoke on the Auditor-General's report into consultants, I made the point that the Taxation Office seeks to apply the most stringent standards to individual taxpayers; yet, as we are starting to see with the successive tabling of these reports, the Australian Taxation Office has failed to keep its own house in order. I also said yesterday that these were most timely reports as the Joint Committee of Public Accounts is presently conducting an investigation into the Australian Taxation Office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one looks at this particular report, which is an efficiency audit&mdash;and very lengthy, with a lot of material in it&mdash;one sees that it is a report that will, I believe, be commented on again and again. As all honourable senators would realise, when reports are tabled in this fashion we only have an hour and a half's notice to look at them. It is regrettable with a detailed report such as this one that we could not have a more lengthy opportunity to go through its 61 recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing that concerns me is that the recommendations seem absolutely sensible in the way they are phrased, yet many of the responses from the Taxation Office appear to be in the nature of `We know better'. For example, recommendation No. 50 reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the ATO consider establishing two specialist FBT audit teams in each branch office in order to achieve a high standard of performance in the conduct of FBT audits and to provide the coverage necessary to ensure compliance under self assessment.</PARA>
<PARA>The response is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This recommendation is not accepted.</PARA>
<PARA>As I flick through the report, I find other instances where the response is that the recommendation not be accepted. I find that rather a concern. There is no reason given in the response. It seems to be simply saying, `We know better'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, there are recommendations, such as those concerning penalties and refunds, to which the response is more detailed. For example, recommendation No. 33 reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the ATO:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)re-examine its policy relating to the imposition of FBT penalties</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)issue instructions to all branch offices to ensure that there is <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">a consistent application of FBT penalties throughout the ATO, and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)give consideration to modifying the FBT system to provide, as a regular statistic, the accumulated values on a branch office basis of potential or recommended penalty prints generated by the system and the accumulated value of penalties actually imposed.</PARA>
<PARA>The response is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the ATO undertakes to re-issue the revised policy and the FBT penalty guidelines to all FBT processing sections and to reiterate the importance of consistency in the application of penalties throughout all branch offices. Consideration will also be given to modifying the FBT system to report potential penalties as compared to penalties actually imposed.</PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General again seems to be pointing out the need for a system within the Taxation Office whereby provision is made to ensure that penalties are administered in a fair and equal manner across the various branch offices. Indeed, in the Estimates hearings, when we were dealing with such things as prosecutions and the manner in which penalties are applied for other tax infringements, we found that there is no centralised database which would enable the Taxation Office to have an even standard so taxpayers would feel that they are getting fair treatment from it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think that anybody would be surprised to know that the Taxation Office is the least popular of all the government agencies and that it is making a real effort to soften its image by talking about its taxpayers as clients, being a friendlier organisation and generally trying to soften the edges. But at the end of the day the Taxation Office has the power to administer very harsh penalties, and what is worrying is that we are seeing more and more evidence that the manner in which taxpayers are treated is not necessarily equal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, I would highlight the distinction between the way in which the Tax Office has treated parliamentarians from the different sides of politics. Mr Keating, the Labor Party man, the now Prime Minister but then Treasurer, failed to lodge his tax return. What happened? He simply got a nice note saying, `Please put it in', whereas other taxpayers, ordinary Australians without any connections, have been prosecuted and penalised. That is the only Labor Party example we have on the record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, we have the case of Mr Smiles who has an apportionment dispute with the Tax Office. He employed someone who had two functions: one was private and one was cost incurred for the production of assessable income. There is a dispute with the Tax Office as to the manner in which that is apportioned. The normal way that that is treated is by discussions and settlement and, if there is to be a prosecution, it is brought under the Tax Administration Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have asked the Tax Office to find me any other example at all of a prosecution for apportionment that has been brought under the Crimes Act, which is the decision that has been taken with regard to Mr Smiles. To say it is extraordinary that the Tax Office has chosen to prosecute Mr Smiles under the Crimes Act is to make the understatement of the year. The reason appears to be quite political, in that if he is prosecuted under the Crimes Act, his seat in the Parliament is placed in jeopardy and that could give an advantage to the Labor Party. If he were prosecuted under the Tax Administration Act, as is the perfectly normal practice, there would be no such jeopardy at all; he would be treated like any other taxpayer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In answer to the Minister, who has a habit of misleading this place, I have asked the Commissioner and his officers those precise questions. I have asked them to provide me with any evidence that shows in any way, shape or form that the way in which the Tax Office has acted is even-handed.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked them to furnish me with any case at all where they have chosen to prosecute under the Crimes Act somebody who is engaged in an apportionment dispute.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have also asked them to furnish me with particulars of the Perth matter that I raised. A taxpayer was found by a tax investigator to have defrauded the revenue by $500,000&mdash;in the vicinity of half a million dollars. I have asked why he was not prosecuted&mdash;why he was let off&mdash;despite 120 cases of fraud being found. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is too much evidence of the system being unfair and not being properly administered. There was also evidence given that at no point does the Tax Office bring together in a central point the nature of the cases that are being prosecuted. I have asked for a copy of the guidelines which exist between the Australian Tax Office and the Director of Public Prosecutions as to when, where and why the Tax Office will refer a particular matter to the DPP to discuss prosecution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is most important that we know how things are gone through, in other words, the process. A fashionable argument that did the rounds for a while&mdash;it came out of the public sector&mdash;said that we should not be concerned with process, we should only be concerned with outcomes. I said on that occasion that I believed that that was an impossible situation and it must be rejected. The fact of the matter is, if the process is corrupt then so is the outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to ensure, and with the help of the Auditor-General perhaps we can start to find some answers, that we find a way in which the Minister is responsible for the efficiency, inefficiency, corruption or otherwise that goes on in his or her department. Quite clearly, during the period that many of these and other reports that we have seen cover, the current Prime Minister&mdash;the unelected Prime Minister&mdash;was the Treasurer of the day. He must be held responsible for what happened in that Tax Office during the period that he was the Treasurer.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know we went through a series of something like five Treasurers in a quick period of time, nonetheless, under the Westminster system we must hold the Ministers accountable for what is occurring in their departments. Simply to say that they were uninformed or did not bother to inform themselves will not do, because under our system of government accountability of the executive arm of government to the Parliament is essential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Minister cannot uphold those standards&mdash;and I say this very much to the Minister for Industrial Relations&mdash;then resign. If a Minister will not resign voluntarily, we must ask the Prime Minister of the day to cause that Minister to resign, and that includes for such things as misleading the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many serious issues raised in this Auditor-General's report and I find them very timely. I am sure that they will be most useful in the Joint Committee of Public Accounts inquiry into the Australian Tax Office. So that at the end of the day, Australian taxpayers will have confidence that the Australian Tax Office is run in a fair and efficient way. That is not the evidence that we have to hand at the moment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The report of the Automotive Industry Authority on the state of the automotive industry in 1991 is one of a series of documents that we have tabled on an annual basis. They are published by the Automotive Industry Authority year by year under its charter of reporting on the developments that have occurred in the automotive industry in the previous 12 months under the so-called Button plan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the report tabled today there is both good news and bad news for the Australian automotive industry. Among the good news is the indication that exports of Australian produced motor vehicles and components have increased over the past 12 months. More importantly, exports now consist in the main of completely built-up motor vehicles, engines and a wider range of components to markets in the United States, Europe and Japan, whereas earlier, the exports consisted mainly of completely knocked down vehicle packs to New Zealand and engines to Europe. It is pleasing to see the way in which the automotive industry is meeting the challenge to increase its penetration of export markets with both a wider range and volume of products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the pieces of bad news is that in 1991&mdash;and, indeed, since 1989&mdash;the prices of locally manufactured motor vehicles have, on average, risen faster than comparable imported vehicles. This still indicates that greater efficiencies are required in the production of motor vehicles in Australia so that their prices can become more competitive with those imported vehicles. The report says that the task for the industry in the years ahead is to avoid price increases above those of imported cars, while matching their specification levels, and that if the industry cannot achieve these objectives, it will continue to lose market share. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A challenge is laid down for the industry that it needs to become more cost competitive while further developing and maintaining the improvement which has been evident in the quality of cars produced in Australia. The quality of Australian produced motor vehicles is the next issue raised in this report. Again, this is an element of good news in the report, because the research undertaken by the Automotive Industry Authority indicates that the quality gap between locally manufactured cars and comparable imports has narrowed significantly. Credit should be given to the industry for achieving that over the past 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Among the bad news is evidence that indicates that labour productivity in the vehicle assembly sector of the industry remains about half that of United States producers and only one-third of that of Japanese producers&mdash;the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) is in the chamber listening to my remarks&mdash;and obviously that area needs continuing attention so that labour productivity is improved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the responsibility not only of workers but also of management in the automotive industry to develop working systems within the industry which will allow a significant improvement in labour productivity. Among those requirements is not only the way in which managers manage their labour force within the industry but also the need for greatly increased investment in the industry to introduce high technology production of automotive components and vehicles within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Australian context, it will only be possible for the Australian industry to reach the required levels of productivity if we embark on the high technology road of motor vehicle production. Therefore, increased investment in that area is absolutely essential. What is advocated in this report is what is termed the lean approach to motor vehicle manufacturing and the goal of lean production. That is spelt out in some detail in this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With my time almost at an end, I conclude as I commenced by saying that there is both good news and bad news in this report. It offers some promise of continuing improvement in the industry in the years ahead.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the hearing conducted by the Estimates Committee into this matter on 27 March, I have had a response to one of the questions I asked which was taken on notice at the time. That question concerned whether the letter that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) wrote recently to the Premiers and Chief Ministers confirming the Government's view that the national income tax sharing scheme proposed by the States to the Commonwealth in early December last year&mdash;whether the view expressed by the former Prime Minister that it was a matter that the Commonwealth could not agree to&mdash;could be made public. I have since had a response to that question on notice to the effect that it could not be made public because it was a matter of normal communication between the Commonwealth and the States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to express considerable regret at receiving that answer. I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan), who is at the table, can comment further on it. It is a matter of very considerable importance.

There is a Premiers Conference next week and I am not sure if anyone outside the inner club&mdash;or even the inner club itself&mdash;knows what will be on the agenda for that conference.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are some things which have come out through the press that the conference will deal with. It seems to be common knowledge that the question of the TAFE funding arrangements will be discussed. The point I am trying to make is that the Premiers have said publicly&mdash;individually and collectively&mdash;that unless there is appropriate consideration of the financial relationship and imbalance that exists between the Commonwealth and the States, all the other areas of micro-economic reform which are said to underpin the whole of the Government's One Nation statement will be impossible, from their point of view, to achieve.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think what we are talking about now is a matter of very great significance. It certainly ought to be of great significance to the Government because the Government is on notice from the Premiers&mdash;including Labor Premiers in particular&mdash;and State Ministers that unless the Commonwealth discusses in a meaningful way the financial relationship between the Commonwealth and the States, it may as well take its bat home so far as the micro-economic reform proposals that it has trumpeted about in the One Nation statement are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears that Senator McMullan is saying to the Senate, five days before what could only be seen as a major conference, that the future of this Government's micro-economic reform programs and the One Nation statement&mdash;whatever else one thinks of them aside&mdash;in essence, will depend very importantly on the Government's willingness to put financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States on the agenda. </PARA>

If Senator McMullan does not wish to comment on that, obviously I cannot force him to do so, but I think it is a matter of very significant importance, and one which I would have thought the Government would wish to provide some comment to the Senate on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am obviously not going to get any meaningful answers to the questions I am putting to Senator McMullan so there is little point in pursuing it, quite obviously. I want to put on the record that, since the now Prime Minister (Mr Keating), when he was a backbencher in October, put his oar in on Commonwealth-State relations in the form of his infamous speech to the National Press Club on that subject, it is quite obvious that the whole process of cooperation and constructive consideration of the most fundamental issues of Commonwealth-State relations has fallen in an almighty heap.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The process which appeared to be going along happily and constructively in the area of cooperative federalism and a proper dialogue between the Commonwealth and the States, has quite obviously fallen into total disrepair.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had the extraordinary statement in the Estimates Committee hearings in March that the Commonwealth-State secretariat within the Prime Minister's own Department had not had any meetings at all to consider Commonwealth-State relations with the States since the aborted Special Premiers Conference that was due to be held in early December. It appears that there has been precious little consultation or discussion with the States since then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From what Senator McMullan has said, there has been one meeting of officials since then. We had a second one today to deal with the preparations for a conference that the States, at least, believe is of vital importance to the future of the Commonwealth-State relationship debate; a conference that I would think is indisputably important for the future of the federal Government's One Nation proposals, because the essence of the Government's economic approach is said to be micro-economic reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minuscule as those proposals are, they will be absolutely non-existent without the cooperation of the States. The Prime Minister, Mr Keating, through his actions over recent months but stemming back to last October, has set back the cause of meaningful reform of Commonwealth-State relations and, in particular, the reform of the financial relationship, which is the sine qua non, if I may use a Latin term, for any proper, serious reform of Commonwealth-State relations. That has gone right on to the back burner. Indeed, it has more than gone on to the back burner. The Prime Minister and his Government have quite arrogantly ruled out of court any of the major proposals that the Premiers and the Chief Ministers put to the Commonwealth late last year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question seems to be predicated on the assumption that there is one methodology that would be suitable for all inquiries, or that would cover all the requirements of any one inquiry. That is currently not the case and is not perceived to be the case in future. Therefore, it is unlikely that some guideline would be presented that would narrow the methodologies in use to one or even to a predetermined small number. I think an intelligent approach to such inquiries is to choose methodologies that suit the problem with which one is confronted. My advice is that that is what the Resource Assessment Commission intends to continue to do. On the face of it, it seems like what one would expect it to continue to do.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, the problem with the answer that the Parliamentary Secretary has given is very simple. At the Estimates hearing it was patently obvious that we had different methodologies between an interim report on the south east forests and the draft and final reports of the forest and timber inquiry. It was made very clear, and I thought it was acknowledged by the officers of the Resource Assessment Commission who dealt with the questions I put to them&mdash;I note that one of them at least is here this evening&mdash;that it could lead to very misleading perceptions being drawn of the reports which the Resource Assessment Commission was making.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question I put is: notwithstanding the fact that the Resource Assessment Commission may wish to experiment with different methodologies from time to time, has the Resource Assessment Commission given any consideration in the intervening period to some consistency as between one report and another so that we can achieve a comparison of the different methodologies? If we use one methodology alone&mdash;for example, shadow prices of timber logs&mdash;then the great danger is that we cannot compare that particular interim report with another interim report or with a more extensive report. It makes the work of the Resource Assessment Commission somewhat wasted because, unless we can draw these comparisons between one report and another, we really do not know what the reports are saying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consistency is of the essence in this matter. So I ask again: has any consideration been given to some sort of consistency of methodology, notwithstanding the fact that the Commission may wish to experiment with different methodologies from time to time?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In view of what I have said to Senator O'Chee already, if we erred on any matter it was on the side of conservatism. In trying to arrive at an appropriate figure, the problem was to identify a single value to cover vehicles expected to compete over a wide price and model range, dependent on age and the cost to importers of getting vehicles to a condition where they could be sold in Australia. It was also necessary to take account of the fact that the penalty duty may have to remain in effect for a number of years, so we set the rate in regard to that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In arriving at the actual figure, the Department reviewed the range of retail used-car prices for comparable vehicles between 1983 and 1991. It used Mazdas, for example, which are available in a very wide range of models priced between $6,250 for some 1983 models to $21,000 for some 1991 models. The penalty duty of $12,000 is, in our view, inherently conservative, given that the importer's costs could be between $5,000 and $7,000 per vehicle, resulting in a minimum retail price of $17,000 to $19,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, it is essential to view the $12,000 in the more general context rather than in relation to the Taiyo situation alone. A number of other companies indicated their interest in this matter. The basic policy consideration is that the Industry Commission, having determined a regime of appropriate protection for the automotive industry after a full inquiry, set a tariff which would phase down to 15 per cent in the year 2000. That was done taking into account a number of factors. It puts considerable pressure on the industry. </PARA>

Some time ago we had an influx of cars and engines. Australian importers started to bring cars in wholesale and they sold very well. The motor traders realised this problem and I suppose advised the Government. We had the non-tariff barrier of the ADRs. Of course, if we put ADRs against imported Japanese cars, the Japanese cars would have a big advantage because they drive on the same side of the road as us, as opposed to German cars or Italian cars. The Government, with pressure from the motor trade and manufacturers, went with the ADR. The Government expected the importers to go away&mdash;and most of them did. The odd company did not go away but came back to meet the ADRs, and they are back again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why the Government came in with the $12,000. Senator Button has explained that the Government had no particular rationale for the $12,000. He then amazed me by saying that that figure might be too conservative. Is the Minister going to keep out second-hand cars&mdash;full stop? After all, the price of second-hand cars in Australia compared with the rest of the Western world is ridiculously high. The Minister cited a figure from Mazda of, I think, $6,000 to $21,000. I presume he went right across the Mazda range or perhaps he was just talking about the Mazda 626. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has said it will use the ADR to keep second-hand cars out, that it was worried about safety and that sort of thing, which the company went to a lot of bother to meet. In fact, the company went to so much bother that the Government had a conscience and volunteered to let it bring in so many cars in the next 12 months or so to make up for the money it had spent. Having done all this, the Government admits that the ADR was not enough. The Government is now admitting that it just wants to keep cars out instead of using the ADR. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot understand the Government picking out the car industry and saying, `We will keep them out&mdash;full stop'. The Government has to tell every other industry that they have no hope of getting any help, they have to put up with the playing field of the rest of the world, yet when it comes to the car industry the Government lets it play in a privileged position. Can we expect these sorts of special tariffs to spread across to other industries?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it is not putting anybody in a privileged position. The Government is concerned only with large volumes of second-hand cars; small volumes of second-hand cars are allowed into this country. Japan operates an industry policy&mdash;at times it is called an environmental policy&mdash;which means that it is unprofitable or it costs a person to keep a car certainly after five years and probably after four. That creates an enormous pressure in the Japanese second-hand car market. Because the cars are right-hand drive, there are three places where that problem can be solved: New Zealand, Australia and the United Kingdom. That is to say, these cars can be bought cheaply in Japan, taken to any one of those countries and, depending upon the market, a significant profit can be made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New Zealand let those cars in. The cars entered New Zealand in very large quantities. There was a reduction of 20,000 in sales of new cars in New Zealand. I think the population of New Zealand is about 2.5 million. It is a very small market, so that is a big reduction. If that were multiplied and followed in Australia, there would be a big reduction in the production of new cars. New Zealand is now conducting an inquiry into the matter. I think it is much better to deal with the problem before it develops too greatly, as I believe it will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United Kingdom has a way of dealing with it. It is much less profitable to sell in the United Kingdom because of transport costs and distance. We have inquired of the Ministry of Transport in the United Kingdom with respect to second-hand car imports. The Ministry approves a prototype vehicle of a particular model. The cost of that prototype approval is $111,000 and it takes a month to get approval. There is then a built-in time delay for testing the imported vehicles if they enter the country in any volume. One hundred vehicles are allowed to be tested a month. A maximum of 1,200 vehicles would be tested in the United Kingdom in a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Individual inspections of each motor car cost the importer $3,000 as an inspection fee and usually, but quite arbitrarily, entail the replacement of some parts, thereby further increasing the importer's costs. Senator Panizza might say that that is a non-tariff barrier; I suspect that it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1988 in this country, when we received widespread representations from Western Australia&mdash;Senator Panizza's State&mdash;about the importation of Japanese cars, it was decided that that problem would be fixed by alterations to the design rules. That worked for a little while, but it no longer works. Rather than go through these tortuous routes which other countries have followed, we felt that it was better to be quite up-front about it and say what we were doing and why. In so far as that may involve special treatment for the automotive industry, as Senator Panizza alleges, it is only true to this extent: the special treatment for the automotive industry was determined by the Industries Assistance Commission when this was not a problem. Now that it is a problem we think that, as a government, it is appropriate for us to abide by the `special treatment', if one wants to use that expression, which the Industries Assistance Commission recommended in respect of the automotive industry and which we accepted&mdash;and we are not having it undermined by that. If Senator Panizza wants to go out and say, `We are the only country in the world which imports second-hand cars from Japan in mass volumes'&mdash;if he would be proud of that boast&mdash;I want him to know that I would not. That is why this policy has been embarked upon. </PARA>

I thought he might have had an ad valorem situation rather than the fixed figure, because if there is a tariff reduction on new cars, there is a $12,000 fixed limit.

Is he still happy to see the importers paying that $12,000 on those cars coming into Australia? I do not know exactly the average age of cars in Australia at present, but I think it is over five years. So, if these cars are five years old, the average age of cars in Australia is being improved upon. It is the same in New Zealand. I believe that the average car age in New Zealand is about 12 or 13 years, unless it has come down.

The Government's strategy in the longer term is to produce better and cheaper new cars in Australia; that is the best result one can obtain for anybody. That is the purpose of the automotive industry policy. If we start flooding the market with second-hand cars, one of the immediate effects on the second-hand car market is probably to lower the price of second-hand cars but certainly to lower the price of the trade-in values which people can obtain trading in old cars for new cars.

After all, the Japanese policy of making it very unprofitable to keep a car after four or five years is an industry policy in Japan, in part to support its industry, which is the best in the world.

The point I am trying to make is that it would be a costly exercise to provide new parts for some of the second-hand models which are now coming into Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This was a matter of some discussion in the newspapers at the time, but the essential concept was to try to establish an industry development fund in Australia to which there would be a number of institutional contributors. This fund would be managed by a board composed of representatives of the institutional contributors and its purpose would be to invest in Australian industry. That is a thumbnail sketch and only a simple version of what the proposal was.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for the proposal was that there is a clearly identifiable gap in the capital markets in Australia and has been for some time. Certainly since the 1987 stock market crash there has been a very clear market and intellectual failure in terms of genuine entrepreneurial skill to satisfy the capital requirements of a number of very many good companies in this country, the expansion of which is limited by lack of capital. That was the essential notion. </PARA>

The motivation for setting up the fund was the recognition that it was very difficult for companies to raise capital in the marketplace. The honourable senator has asked: why did the Government not do it itself; did it not have the money? With the greatest of respect, the honourable senator may be an old style socialist and in favour of the Government investing taxpayers' money in businesses; I am not.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last Sunday this famous unit, the 4th/19th Prince of Wales's Light Horse, was granted the Freedom of the City of Fitzroy and, as they say, marched with swords drawn, bayonets fixed, bands playing, drums beating and flags flying. I understand that the tradition of granting freedom of the city dates from Roman times. Legions were allowed into the city of Rome only on special occasions&mdash;typically after a great victory had been won. There were some 250 men and women on parade last Sunday. The senior army officers General Glenny and Brigadier McManus attended the parade and the salute was taken by the distinguished and popular Mayor of Fitzroy, Angela Ireland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The regiment traces its roots back to the Crimean War in the 1850s, when it was raised as part of a volunteer movement, although the exact date is unknown. By 1863, the title `Prince of Wales's' was bestowed on the successor of the first unit to honour the marriage of the heir apparent. The origins of today's 4th/19th Prince of Wales's Light Horse stem from three separate organisations: the 17th Prince of Wales's Light Horse, the 19th Yarrowee Light Horse and the 4th ex-Corangamite Light Horse. The three regiments were amalgamated on 1 April 1948. Last Sunday also marked the linking of the 4th/19th Prince of Wales's Light Horse and the 8/13th Victorian Mounted Rifles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 4th Light Horse was the only Australian unit to see service in all three fronts of World War I, namely, France, Gallipoli and Palestine. As a result of this service, it was presented with no less than 24 battle honours. Although the unit has primarily existed as a volunteer or Reservist unit, it did raise a Regular Army squadron in the early 1960s in order to send a troop to Vietnam to support Australian operations in that theatre in 1965-66. As a result of that tour of duty, the regiment earned the `US Meritorious Unit' commendation, becoming the only reserve unit in Australia to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The role of the 4th/19th Prince of Wales's Light Horse today is quite different from the unit's role in the original light horse days. The once crucial role of horses made way for Grant and Centurion tanks, the Ferret Scout Cars and, today, M113A1 armoured reconnaissance vehicles. Another important change since the unit's early days is the appointment of women within the unit. Lieutenant Andrea Heath is the unit's transport officer and there are some 45 other women in the unit. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Queensland)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP> (7.45 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night I added to my previous comments with respect to the new air traffic control system in Australia, with particular reference to how the selection was managed. I shall have much more to say on that in due course, but tonight I want to confine my remarks to a few key points which I did not have time to expand on last night.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point I referred to last night was the responsibility of the directors of the Civil Aviation Authority. I pointed out that they were showing little evidence that they appreciated the legal position that they are in. I mentioned that they have responsibilities and obligations under law. The company law of Australia applies as much to them, as directors of a government business enterprise, as it does to someone operating as a director of a public company. I drew their attention to the charges currently being laid against the directors of Compass. I suggested that there was a similarity in the two situations. I pointed out that their liability could in fact be greater financially because if the contract price of around $200m blows out and the service is delayed and not up to the standard required, they could be held responsible for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the other element is the accident rate. What we have is a contract being awarded to a company with a proven history of losing aircraft on its detection systems for its air traffic control. That is not an academic point. There are failures in the software program of the preferred tenderer&mdash;Thomson-CSF. There is a history of a failure to detect and record the presence of aircraft on the installations it has made overseas. There is abundant evidence of it in our own country: aircraft have been lost in Melbourne airspace; aircraft are still being lost in Cairns airspace. I emphasise that this is not an academic point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder whether this doctrine of affordable safety is not part of the current doctrine of the Civil Aviation Authority. My mind goes back to the time when Sir Donald Anderson was the head of the Department of Civil Aviation. He was arguably one of the greatest directors of aviation in this country. His slogan was, `Safety is no accident'. He must be turning in his grave at the thought of affordable safety. The Civil Aviation Authority has never explained what `affordable safety' is. Does it mean the loss of one major aircraft a decade or a year? Does it look at its statistics and say, `We have a perfect safety record in Australia. People travelling on buses do not enjoy that. Other countries do not have the same safety record as we do; we must be wasting money on safety'? If we are to believe that sort of thing, which is the doctrine of the Civil Aviation Authority, perhaps it is possible to select a company such as Thomson, with a proven history of being unable to detect aircraft in airspace. But even if the Civil Aviation Authority does that, it has to consider its liability. I would hate to think of what would happen if two airliners collided because one or both of them did not appear on a radar screen of an air traffic control unit at a busy airfield. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further to the points I am making in relation to this matter, I refer to a submission made by Hughes Radar to the Board of the Civil Aviation Authority on 15 April. The submission states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three areas where Hughes has reason to believe that the CAA Board of Directors did not have complete or accurate information leading up to the TAAATS decision to select Thomson as the preferred contractor: (1) contractor risk, (2) the source selection process, and (3) Australian Industry participation.</PARA>
<PARA>The first thing the submission deals with is the Hughes software risk. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Hughes software development capability has been assessed by the Software Engineering Institute of Carnegie-Mellon University. This is a widely recognized and highly regarded rating system that judges the calibre of companies' software tools, facilities, methodologies and state-of-the-art software development techniques. A copy of the Hughes rating is attached. The level 3 rating contained therein is the highest rating given to any contractor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Hughes TAAATS software solution is based on a rehost of the highly successful Korean Air Traffic System. The KATC includes Flight Data Processing and Radar Data Processing Function. The system has not lost a single minute of operational service since it became operational in 1986. It should be noted that the capabilities of the KATC match or exceed those of the majority of ATC systems in operation today, including those systems produced by Thomson.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A few important points flow from that. We know that the capital of South Korea, Seoul, is very close to the demilitarised zone. Those of us who have been to the demilitarised zone know that it is one of the most tense points in the world. The need for the South Koreans to have a fail-safe air traffic control system, which not only looks after civil traffic but doubles as a military airspace surveillance scheme, is absolutely vital. One of the characteristics of the Hughes software programs is that it can accommodate both functions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is also very important for Australia. We do not have the money to have two separate systems&mdash;a national airspace surveillance system for the RAAF or the Australian Defence Force and one for air traffic control. The characteristics of the two differ to the extent that in civil applications aircraft identify themselves by the use of transponders and communication with ground stations; whereas in military operations people try to operate covertly, they do not advertise their presence. Nevertheless, while the detection of the traffic is different, the handling of data has degrees of similarity. It is an advantage to Australia to have a contractor who provides a system which, with minimal or no extra cost, will accommodate both functions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The submission continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The TAAATS software represents less than 3% of the total contract price. Eighty-eight per cent of the TAAATS functionality has previously been delivered in Jovial software language. Approximately 60% of the software functionality has been redone in Ada for other systems. All of the software will be completed in Ada nine months after contract go ahead, and 15 months before the TAAATS need dates. The conversion of ATC software has been underway for one and a half years. This is clearly an area of low risk; otherwise, Hughes would have scheduled more time and resources to accomplish this task. In fact, the CAA based their assessment of Hughes risk on those software tasks that amount to only approximately 1% of the contract price. We have demonstrated experience and recognized credibility to believe in our proposed schedule and cost estimates.</PARA>
<PARA>The submission goes on to refer to the colour raster display. That is one of the points of contention. A huge amount of information is required to be presented. The old technology, the cursive display system with a light pencil, has been replaced by a technique known as a colour raster display. Not only is that in full colour, but it allows a great deal more detail to be put on the screens in front of the controllers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very high technology is involved. I am advised that there is only one manufacturer of those screens&mdash;Sony in Japan. Not only is the acquisition of the screen crucial, but the development of the software program to generate the symbology is highly critical. We are not talking about something that someone does with a lead pencil on the back of a used envelope on a Saturday afternoon in between watching the racing results; this is something that involves tens of millions of dollars and years of work to generate a system that actually works. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CAA, in its claim that Hughes was a higher risk, accepted the assertion from Thomson that it would be able to supply a colour raster display. Since the colour raster display is the interface between the human beings in the air traffic control situation and the data that they are operating with, it is quite important. Thomson claims that it will provide a colour raster screen&mdash;although it has never done so anywhere in the world previously. Thomson has only worked up prototype schemes, but no-one has bought them. I do not know what Thomson is providing to the Swiss air traffic control at present, but I understand that the Swiss Government&mdash;with the small Thomson contract it has&mdash;is very dissatisfied with the display screens that it has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This submission from Hughes to the board in relation to raster screen work stations says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The CAA has underestimated another area of high risk in the Thomson proposal. Namely, Thomson is introducing a colour raster scan workstation. All their deliveries to date have utilized either a monochromatic stroker workstation, which is dated technology, or a prototype raster scan workstation. High performance raster scan workstation development for ATC Systems requires significant investment both in hardware and software. Thomson is believed to be at least 2 years and millions of dollars behind Hughes in producing a production quality 20" raster scan workstation. Hughes began raster scan workstation development in the early 80s. Approximately $100M has been invested by Hughes and its customers in development of this technology. Hughes has over seven-hundred and fifty (750) 20" raster scan workstations on order, some of which have already been delivered. During the RADREP competition&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which was the competition to replace the radar control systems in Brisbane and Sydney&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">which was primarily for workstations, Hughes was selected as the winner; Siemens-Plessey was second, and Thomson was a distant third.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of particular concern should be the development of a specialized graphic engine, as commercially available graphic engines will not meet the demanding requirements of an ATC system. Secondly, there is a significant amount of unique software associated with the Man Machine Interface. Hughes has accomplished this software work for our workstations for the Icelandic and Taiwanese Air Defense Programs, as well as the Canadian ATC system. Thomson has significant workstation development remaining which must be considered a higher risk.</PARA>
<PARA>Thomson is saying, `If you want a colour raster screen, Australia, we will give it to you'. My mind goes back to the negotiations. I am glad that Senator Tate is here because he slept through many a speech of mine on the new tactical fighter in 1978 and 1979 when, once more, strangely enough, we were talking about radars and side lobe propagation and other things that confused Senator Tate no end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting at the time of the new tactical fighter debate that the RAAF team&mdash;we are talking somewhere around 1979-80&mdash;was looking at a number of aircraft to replace the Mirage III that the RAAF had operated for some years. One of the aircraft on the short list at that time was the Mirage 2000, which was a new aeroplane designed by Dassault. They looked at this aeroplane in France and it had in it a very basic Thomson-CSF fire control radar. They said, `The RAAF specification is to be able to have a look-down capability in our radar amongst a lot of other capabilities in the air to air mode'. Thomson said, `If you want a look-down radar, we will give you a look-down radar', as if there was nothing to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point at issue is that the ability to look down with a radar in an aeroplane and identify a moving target at low level&mdash;maybe 30,000 or 40,000 feet below&mdash;is highly complex. No-one could do it but the Americans&mdash;in fact, no-one could do it but Hughes. There are all these returns. It is difficult enough at sea with the wave formation sending a random pattern back. Over land there is much worse. It is extraordinarily difficult to pick up a low flying aircraft. It is highly sophisticated software which enables a signal processor to identify a low flying aeroplane in this circumstance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thomson had no way on earth of developing that technology in 1979 or 1980, but it was quite prepared to tell the RAAF team that it could do it within a certain cost and, relatively speaking, within a very short time. Nothing could have been further from the truth. In fact, until one American worker in this field sold out the technology to the Soviets, it was exclusively the property of the United States. The tragedy was that, quite apart from the fact that the fellow who sold it out was a traitor, he was also a fool. He sold this technology, which would be worth probably hundreds of millions of dollars in today's prices, for something like $30,000 or some absurd pittance. Once that happened, the technology moved around the world and other people developed it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unless it is felt that this is a small point, at the time of the Falklands war it will be remembered that the Royal Air Force and the Fleet Air Arm were shooting down a high proportion of the Argentinean aircraft that were flying in in daylight to attack the Falklands to support the Argentineans on the ground through that campaign. The Argentinean air force flew in C130s at night to resupply. It did that by doing a low level insertion. The British Sea Harriers were then equipped with Ferranti Blue Fox radars which had no effective look-down capability. The system was very limited over water and there was none at all over land, so they could not detect the C130s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the promise that Thomson can just simply come up with a colour raster display because it is required in the contract without spending a great deal of time and money has to be taken with some degree of suspicion. I have only touched on a couple of points about that tonight. It is nowhere near the end of the document that I was quoting from. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not everything, no. I am happy to accommodate the Minister. I want to expand on the fact that the CAA board found that Thomson had a low risk. The document states that Thomson is not delivering a proven system as the CAA contends. At least two areas should be of concern. The first concerns software. The document states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Thomson design for TAAATS requires rehosting of their Belgian air traffic control software written in Ada from Data General computers to Digital Equipment Corporation computers. Thomson has not delivered a single airspace management system of the size of TAAATS that uses DEC computers. Consequently, Thomson must rehost all its software on a computer that is new to its software and systems engineers. In contrast, Hughes has implemented a number of its systems, such as United Kingdom Air Defence System, Forward Area Air Defence Command and Control, a classified command and control system, and the Intelligent Interface Processor for Germany on the DEC computers proposed for TAAATS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note that different operating systems are used in the DG and DEC computers. These operating systems provide differences in service as well as in performance and responsiveness to the flight data processing and radar data processing application software. Consequently, the application software may have to be revised to </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">obtain the same service from the operating systems and also to achieve the same performance responsiveness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tuning of applications and operating systems software to achieve required performance requires an intimate knowledge of how the operating systems work. Thomson's software engineers will have to develop a thorough understanding of the DEC operating systems environment before they can be considered proficient and therefore a lower risk than Hughes. Thomson's software engineers will also need to become proficient in using the DEC Ada compiler instead of the DG Ada compiler.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many other points of similar worth. I will probably revisit this document in future. For the benefit of Madam Acting Deputy President, who I know has another engagement, I will conclude my comments tonight by saying that, once more, this is not the end of the document and nor is it the end of my comments on the subject. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is most unusual that a company of Hughes' standing should feel the need to make this submission directly to the board of the CAA. After all, it is one of the leading companies&mdash;arguably the leading company&mdash;in this field in the world. What is even more extraordinary is that the board of the Civil Aviation Authority should dismiss this submission as being of no consequence. </PARA>
