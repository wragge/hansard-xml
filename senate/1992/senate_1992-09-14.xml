<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it starts today, It will be good discipline for the Minister to start today. As is provided in the Standing Orders, Question Time is the time when Ministers answer questions as to the administration of their departments. That has been so abused in recent times that it has ceased to have that effect at all. As you know, Mr President, on one day last week the Opposition in an hour of Question Time received three questions; and on the following day, four questions. That is not at all how the process was designed to operate. It was suggested for a while that perhaps interjections were at least part of the cause of that slow progress.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As you recall, Mr President, we managed to restrain colleagues, despite the provocation last Thursday, from making interjections, and the problem still continued. It is therefore obvious that Question Time, as it was intended to operate, is not going to be permitted to operate because these Ministers are going to abuse their responsibility. In particular, the worst culprit last week was Senator Button, who sought to turn each Question Time into a one-sided debate on the car industry and then had the nerve to say to us across the chamber, `We are happy to debate this at any time'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was not so at all. He simply sought to put down his case without the Opposition having any opportunity, because of the structure of Question Time, to answer. That is not the time for debate; the time for debate is after Question Time, and we are happy to take Senator Button on in that debate any time he likes. But in Question Time, which is our right to be able to question Ministers on their administration, we want that right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Question Time is part of the Westminster system. It is respected in most chambers of this kind. Everybody knows it is not respected in the House of Representatives. It is totally abused in the House of Representatives. It becomes a farce in the House of Representatives and, sadly, in recent times this Government in this place has sought to do the same thing in the Senate. It was once never the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a time, even in the years that I have been here, when questions were asked in this place and Ministers sought to answer them rather than lecture the Senate or give speeches on their policies or, as in recent times, generally abuse those on the other side of the chamber. As I said, it need not operate that way. A motion such as this need not be carried if Ministers were prepared to meet their responsibility. They are not prepared to meet that responsibility and, therefore, it is time that the Senate took control of the matter. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Collins" NAMEID="OF4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is time that the Senate took control of the matter, particularly for people such as Senator Collins, in order to get answers to questions rather than the tirade of abuse that we have to put up with each day. I have therefore moved this motion which, if it is carried, will be a reform to this Senate that will result in a better Senate and a better accountability of Ministers for their administration.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will support this motion, recognising that it is being imposed for only one week. It would be a very chastening experience indeed for many of the Government Ministers to strip their answers down to two minutes. I am quite sure that most answers could be given in that time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I also have a word for the Opposition. We have seen many points of order being taken, perhaps not in the latter part of the week, as Senator Hill pointed out, but certainly in the early part of the week. We would therefore move an amendment that the time taken to make and determine points of order not be regarded as part of the time for questions or answers. So, in the giving of a two-minute answer, the relevant Minister would have at least a full two minutes to give that answer. We look to both the Government and the Opposition to support that amendment. That will allow three minutes for each question and three minutes for supplementary questions and, with six minutes, we might be able to get through 10 questions in the hour, which surely is enough. Without extending this debate any further, we simply indicate that we support the motion but with an amendment relating to points of order. I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This motion comes as something of a surprise to us. We were not extended the usual courtesies in respect of a motion of this kind, but that is nothing unusual.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Hill took five minutes to make a very simple point. Question Time is about eliciting information, and if those opposite seriously want information in this place rather than this sort of stunt, which will reduce Question Time to a set of staccato exchanges, then I think they should stick with what they have got. As has already been pointed out, it will be very interesting to see whether some of the questions are comprehensible if they have to be confined to one minute. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the motion and I compliment the Opposition on the phrasing of the motion. I informed the Opposition that I was about to put that motion during the time allotted for notices of motion, so I can scarcely disagree with it. However, I regret that it needed to be introduced by a contingency motion rather than being debated at the proper time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also agree with and support the Democrats' amendment because I feel that the kind of grandstanding that takes place in Question Time is part of the deterioration of the process.

It may appear to be too great a restraint on individual questioners and answerers, particularly in the light of their form; however, the optimum number of 20 questions to be asked and answered in each Question Time would be achieved by this motion and the timing that has been stated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He said it last Friday when I was away. He has also said it on earlier occasions, because I have heard him publicly. The Prime Minister has made the point that, in the past, United States policy in the Pacific has been in the context of the Cold War and the approach taken to combating the military presence of the Soviet Union&mdash;an approach which emphasised naval power and bilateral alliance relationships, and an approach which has not given particular weight to multilateral defence arrangements or cooperative strategies.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, the Australian Government is very concerned by the reports of the killing and wounding of Solomon Islands citizens during a raid by a PNGDF unit on a trades store at Kamalea in the western Solomon Islands, which appears to have taken place on 12 September. The Papua New Guinea Prime Minister, Mr Wingti&mdash;who, since his elevation, has been very concerned to improve Papua New Guinea's relations with the Solomon Islands&mdash;has been reported by news services to have been shocked by accounts of the raid and to have called for a full report from military commanders.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I refer to recent suggestions that Australia should join NAFTA, to the Minister's own suggestion that APEC should be developed into a free trade community with Australia's participation, and to the Government's and Opposition's single-minded preoccupation with tariff cutting. Does the Minister agree that some nations which compete with Australia do not possess adequate wage levels, work safety standards and environmental safeguards? Secondly, how does the Minister propose to protect these standards, which are part of Australia's quality of life, unless Australian industries and workers are protected by tariffs or quotas to ensure that we are not dragged down to the lowest common denominator?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first point I would make, I guess, is that any economist worth his salt, whether wet, dry or damp, would accept the point that standard of living and workers' conditions are not best guaranteed over time by trying to erect high tariff barriers around domestic industry but rather by a nation trading competitively on the basis of its comparative advantage and ensuring that, as a result, nations do get the benefit of that open trading environment and that that flows through into the cost of purchasing particular consumer goods. That is, of course, why it is that this Government has generally favoured a significant reduction over time in tariffs and a freeing up of the Australian trade environment, including in our own region but extending beyond that to the rest of the world. The difference between us and the Opposition, of course, is the manic zeal with which the Opposition is pursuing its position to absurd and intolerable limits so far as at least two major industries are concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point I would make is that, in the specific context of the Asian-Pacific regional area, I think Senator Spindler understated in his question the extent to which there is already occurring a significant convergence of wage and other standards in the major trading economies in this region. That is a phenomenon that seems likely to continue at a fairly rapid pace in the years ahead.

Its policy is a low wage policy, a policy to drive down wages in Victoria and drive down working conditions in that State. The fact that it is lauded by Mr Howard and Dr Hewson only serves to indicate that it is a prototype for Federal industrial relations policy&mdash;a policy espoused by the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, in an infamous address in Auckland this year as a big bang which will blow the winds of change through industrial relations in Australia. What a joke! Ever since the big bang policy has been proclaimed, Australian business has come out and said with one voice that this policy of the big bang would be counterproductive; it would destroy the very positive gains made at workplace bargaining level in Australia, and would create a counterproductive backlash that would set this economy back quite a long way.</PARA></TALK.START>

The first key feature is that all workers and employers in Victoria are put outside of the industrial relations system immediately&mdash;that is the immediate effect&mdash;and, while their awards continue, they have no recourse to the industrial relations system or the arbitrator unless one or the other of them agrees. So, if we have a dominant union able to screw an employer, it is unlikely to agree; if we have a dominant employer able to screw a worker, as is the case given the level of unemployment in Victoria, there is no access to the umpire for fair play at all.

We go back one century in industrial relations in Australia to take industrial relations through the civil courts&mdash;courts that are already clogged by litigants so we do not get a place in the queue; courts not equipped to deal with industrial relations; courts that provide justice for those who can afford it. Therefore, where court actions are beyond the capacity of individual workers litigating against a company, then those workers do not even have the rudimentary access to justice that would be applied even through the civil courts.

What I spoke of was a convergence of commercial culture, and that is an analysis that I stand behind. Business is being done in a remarkably similar way all around the region, by a whole heap of countries, including, for example, the People's Republic of China with which one never previously associated any such concept. That is making for a trading environment in the Asia-Pacific region which lends itself increasingly to the kind of cooperation, harmonisation and eventually free trade arrangements that have been the case in Europe.</PARA></TALK.START>

The point is that, in a purely economic context, already the degree of cooperation, harmonisation and liberalisation within the Asia-Pacific region is significantly ahead of that which existed, as I understand it, in the European Community in the early 1950s when the concept of a European Economic Community first took hold.</PARA>

It is perfectly reasonable to think in terms of APEC evolving over time as a single large free trade area as a result of the development over time&mdash;quite a long time one would imagine&mdash;of subregional free trade groupings which are gradually extended with the benefits of liberalisation extending as a result.

It is the Opposition that cannot understand, in particular, how it is that Australia would have very great difficulty indeed in benefiting from any specific free trade arrangement with the United States or the NAFTA countries, given the extent to which we already have free access for a whole range of goods, subject to some important exceptions in agricultural areas where there is a degree of managed trade which is highly unlikely ever to be alleviated by the particular domestic lobbies concerned, as Canada has found to its cost in the course of its negotiation of NAFTA.

I have absolutely no reason whatsoever to believe that that withdrawal of military support has been in any way changed in recent times or at any time since the settlement plan has been put into place. That is based on conversations that I have had as recently as a couple of days ago with the Chinese Foreign Minister as well as with confirmatory reporting from many other sources.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister for Industrial Relations aware of a recent report by the International Labour Organisation which shows that Australia has one of the best records on achieving pay equity for women&mdash;second only to Iceland, I believe?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One mark of how fair and just a society is is how it treats people who are not equal. It has been a long time sad history in Australia that women have not received equal pay and, now that they have the equal pay entitlement, have not always received fair treatment in the work force. Therefore, I was pleased to see the ILO's findings, which appeared in its world labour report for 1992, that Australia is ranked second in the group of 14 OECD countries in terms of achieving pay equity for women. The report finds that, in Australia, female non-managerial employees working full time earn 87.9 per cent of men's earnings. In comparison, women in Iceland earn 90.6 per cent of men's earnings. Women in West Germany receive less than Australia&mdash;73.6 per cent&mdash;and in Japan they earn much less, 50.7 per cent. On that table, Australia must rank as a very good performer in terms of social justice and pay equity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most outstanding features of the report was that in Australia, unlike most other OECD countries, women's earnings improved during the 1980s. I might say by way of a side comment that they fell back under the Fraser Government. The pay-equity gap widened under Fraser but it closed more closely under the Hawke years of the Labor Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1980 non-managerial women earned 86 per cent of women's earnings and by 1988, the last year included in the report&mdash;I refer to the Hawke years because this was the period surveyed by the report&mdash;this figure had improved to 87.9 per cent. Since then the position of non-managerial women workers has improved even further and was 90.1 per cent in May 1991.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has not normally been Government policy to oppose the very new and increasing practice of noting questions after Question Time. However, this is not to note a question given at this Question Time but a previous one. Therefore, it is very difficult to argue urgency because, if it had been urgent Wednesday last week, we could have commented on it then. It has suddenly become urgent between Wednesday and Monday. The other reason why the Government has sought at this stage to oppose the motion is quite clearly on the matter of time. It is a matter that should be addressed. It could be addressed sensibly, if we agree that this is a new and innovative process to debate questions after Question Time, if we actually set a time limit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it was quite fair for us at least today to say, `Well, if we are limited to two minutes, why does not the other side try two minutes themselves?'. Can they condense their argument into two minutes? If Senator Walters was incapable today of putting her case in two minutes and required three minutes, I suppose the same could have been said for some Ministers for some answers today. But those opposite did not worry about that&mdash;`Just roll right over the top; don't worry about that, Ministers will only have two minutes'. Well, why should those opposite not have two minutes in their response? We sat here with two questions coming to frontbenchers&mdash;I think Senator Short and Senator Alston&mdash;who went seven or eight minutes each in their answers to their own back bench. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is just part of the hypocrisy of this chamber. I do not want to anticipate a later motion on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>. It is no wonder that people get disillusioned about this chamber when they see the degree of double standards that exist in this chamber. But if we want to sensibly approach this matter, take it out of this particular debate today, and if we want to sensibly say as part of the Senate process&mdash;something that virtually did not exist a year ago&mdash;that, after Question Time, we want to note three or four questions and have a debate, for heaven's sake let us get sensible about it and let us set time limits. It does not have to be the same time limit as we have on Question Time but a sensible time limit, instead of someone getting up by way of ambush and where we have to shout over, `Well, how long?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was responsible in this chamber the other day for making arrangements that were breached. We said five minutes a speaker. The next three speakers&mdash;one on this side and two on the other side&mdash;went for seven or eight minutes. So if honourable senators opposite want to institutionalise the noting of answers to questions and have, if you like, a replacement of MPIs and urgency motions, let us structure it. Let us not have the anarchy of it going on for two mindless hours of boring repetition. In a lot of cases these things are worse than MPIs because the speeches are not even properly structured or prepared and people ramble on to waste time, one after the other with no structure whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat: this matter is certainly not urgent. Senator Walters can get up on the adjournment tonight and put her views. The second thing is that the reason we oppose the suspension of Standing Orders today whereas we may not on other days is the monumental hypocrisy of the Opposition in saying that a Minister of the Government can spend two minutes on an answer but a backbencher should have three minutes to do the same thing. Maybe there is a difference in terms of the Opposition's motion in that the intellectual powers of certain Opposition backbenchers are such that they cannot condense their contributions into two minutes. What we have seen today is monumental hypocrisy. But we should sort it out for the longer term, instead of meandering into a new process in the Senate with no discipline whatsoever. </PARA>

<PARA>I will be brief. In his reply to Senator Loosley, Senator Ray sought to castigate the policy announced by the Democrats on 9 July in relation to a cut in defence spending of as little as 12 1/2 per cent&mdash;$1 1/4 billion, admittedly. This was money which was to go into an area in which Australia is in desperate need&mdash;namely, the restructuring of industry and providing jobs for Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Ray seems not to have realised that we have got to the end of the Cold War and that our needs now are different from our needs of 10 or 15 years ago. The ordering of the frigates, submarines and so on related to an earlier period in Australia's defence needs and does not relate to where Australia's threat is coming from now. Australia is not threatened now from an external military force. Australia is threatened internally from a decline in its economic circumstances; the large number of unemployed people; the large number of people who are becoming alienated; the young people who are committing suicide; and the sort of people whom Senator Baume himself has talked about quite often. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We simply want to redirect some of that defence money into areas from which Australia needs to be defended, namely, those internal threats which are coming from the decayed and rotted economy which has been brought onto this country by this Government. It is a beating of submarines and frigates into ploughshares because that is the real need for this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amount of money concerned, $1 1/4 billion, was not to be taken out of the defence Budget and simply frittered away but was to be redirected&mdash;and that was specifically included in my statement of 9 July&mdash;in ways which would restructure industry and provide the sort of employment which was necessary. Specifically, $450m of that $1 1/4 billion would go towards providing jobs in the industries which could take up the unemployment generated by the loss of those submarine and frigate contracts. Very careful attention was given to the redirection of that money so that those people engaged in those activities at present, those people with particular skills in the electronics industry and other industries, would not be disadvantaged or thrown on the scrap heap but would, indeed, find other employment in a civilly directed defence posture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fair to say that all reports in recent times have indicated that Australia will not suffer any immediate threat from external military intervention in the next 10 to 15 years. It is also true that since the end of the Cold War the alliances which we built up during that time&mdash;although we had doubts about those alliances&mdash;are no longer necessary. Much of the defence expenditure, specifically in the area of submarines and frigates, was related more to those alliances than to the defence of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is difficult to see how the half a dozen submarines that we would build would be related to an effective defence of this country outside that alliance. There are other areas where that money would be much better spent. I believe the reply given by Senator Ray was a total misrepresentation of the Democrats' stance, a denial of the threats which this country clearly faces&mdash;from inside the country, not outside&mdash;an emphasis on threats which are now long past and an emphasis on alliances which are no longer relevant to Australia's defence needs. I believe that this chamber&mdash;indeed all people in Australia&mdash;should give a great deal of attention to the proposals that were contained in our `Getting to Work' document launched on 9 July. </PARA>

Leaving aside compensation, the program would save a lot more than $1.25 billion. Senator Coulter would rip about $3 billion out of the Defence Force budget. He should not be modest about it. Of course, the difficulty will be that it will be at the expense of an enormous number of jobs, and at the same time, when the honourable senator wants to reinvest that money, these companies will need to be paid compensation. We will lose the jobs, and get no replacement jobs in the short term&mdash;I am talking of one to two years. As a scheme it is crackpot. The press release states further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Scrap the F-111's . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I know that would appeal to the honourable senator's ideological predilections. The F111 happens to be the best bomber in the world and there is no other on the drawing board. Every country, when it configures its defence forces, usually has about 85 per cent defensive and 15 per cent offensive.

I assume that means the South Pacific patrol boat program&mdash;one of the best programs ever instituted in the South Pacific&mdash;which has meant that those countries can patrol their own fishing grounds and become viable, or have a chance at becoming viable, for the first time in their lives. That program has meant that they can stop a variety of rapacious nations coming in and fishing out the area. They can now protect it, apprehend the vessels, auction them off and fish their own fishing grounds. That is the very sort of independence&mdash;rather than dependence&mdash;we should be promoting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats want to close North West Cape. That is not a particularly good idea because they would be scrapping only one submarine; how are we going to communicate with the rest of the submarines when they are under water? I know the Democrats are scrapping the new ones and taking one existing one out of service, but the other three or four are supposed to go blind around the Indian and Pacific oceans, are they? Because that is the only way we could contact them under water. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought that Senator Coulter would at least have known that on 1 October this year an Australian commander will take over North West Cape, and we have an agreement with the Americans for it to become a totally Australian facility over the next seven years. It is not an overseas base or anything else. I ask Senator Coulter: why not, at least in this one case, drop your ideological baggage?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats want to close Pine Gap and convert Nurrungar. I have referred to that and I will not repeat my comments about that, but it is just a touch hypocritical to want to close them on 9 July and then, in early September, want to put them up for negotiations on wheat. If we succeed, where does this policy stand? Where do the Democrats stand on this policy if we do put those two things on the negotiating table and the Americans say, `Oh, gee, right&mdash;you're back in the wheat business. Are you back in the bases business? No, you're not'. And on it goes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to speak about one or two other aspects of this matter, but I do not want to take the same amount of time as Senator Coulter. Senator Coulter made the statement that there is no immediate threat to Australia for 10 to 15 years. On what basis does he make that calculation? He makes it on nothing we in Defence have put out and on nothing that Foreign Affairs, or any other intelligent defence observer in this country, has. We have, however, held to the seven-year warning time as espoused in the 1987 White Paper, and we think it is as true today as it was then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The absolute fundamental point where Senator Coulter gets it wrong is where he says, `With the end of the Cold War, we can go away and do other things'. I can tell Senator Coulter that Australian defence policy was never configured to the Cold War. If he goes back and reads the Dibb report and the 1987 White Paper on defence, he will find that our defence policy has always been configured to regional needs&mdash;never to the Cold War. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been living in this country without an identifiable enemy for 20 years. It is the same fundamental point that Canada and many countries in Europe have to come to terms with. How does a country configure its defence forces without a readily identifiable enemy?  What Senator Coulter would do is say, `We don't need defence. We'll just scrap it. We'll plough the money into a few greenie things'&mdash;all of which have some merit, but if a threat suddenly emerges in a shorter time frame than 10 or 15 years, this country is gone. As I indicated at Question Time, a range of people in this country in the 1930s argued exactly the same thing as Senator Coulter did in his press release. It meant that in 1939 we were not able to defend ourselves. It was not just, as some people interjected, Labor Party pacifists; it was basically across the board in the history of this country, as one would see from reading the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> debates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this country is about is defence in depth, defence self-reliance and a modest allocation to defence of 2.4 per cent of gross domestic product. We are not a big defence spender by regional comparisons in terms of percentage of GDP. There is no peace dividend in this country because we were never at Cold War levels. We were not like Great Britain and other countries, spending 5.5 or 6 per cent of GDP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we do is set up a basic platform on which to defend this country&mdash;a platform which can be expanded if there is a high level contingency threat. If we drop that structure in the way that Senator Coulter wants to, it can never be recovered and it can never be rebuilt. It is the minimal structure. What Senator Coulter is seeking to do, for whatever motive possible&mdash;appealing to other people in the electorate; I do not know&mdash;is to drop us below that critical mass. I can tell Senator Coulter that if we did that, we would never recover in defence terms. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the incredible events of the last week or so, in particular, the attacks by the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, upon Dr Hewson in relation to trade issues. There is also the aspect of the linkage between domestic policy and trade. We on this side of the chamber have sought to put down a policy for economic reform that has the potential to result in Australia being internationally competitive again. That is what Fightback is all about&mdash;taking taxes off business, reforming the industrial relations system and removing tariffs, because they become imposts on our capacity to export, so that we can be domestically and internationally efficient and competitive again within our region and in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Beyond that, there is then the question: if we are competitive domestically and we can compete internationally, are there barriers and obstacles that will inhibit our business community from taking full advantage of that new competitiveness? That is what the trade debate is all about. It is a debate up until now in which this Government has not been prepared to engage. It has only engaged in the debate now because the Prime Minister has resorted to his usual tactic of personal abuse in attacks upon two matters that Dr Hewson raised a little over a week ago. I think that the debate ought to be put in a rational and sensible sense, which to date it has not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first criticism was that Dr Hewson had the nerve to criticise continuing barriers that exist in the case of Japan. He criticised the extent of tariff and other barriers in Japan that are obstacles to expanding Australian trade. That, according to the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, was beyond the pale: it should not be done by an opposition leader and could in some way result in the deterioration of our relationship with Japan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter Dr Hewson raised was that of restrictions and obstacles imposed upon our export opportunities by the United States. Coincidentally or otherwise, the comments by Dr Hewson came at the same time as we experienced an enormous rise in the EEP subsidies within the United States upon its wheat exports, which have, as I think everyone understands, the effect of pushing down the price of wheat on the international market and which detrimentally affect the well-being of our producers. They also have the effect, as I think Senator Boswell and others will say, of increasing the likelihood of the US putting such subsidised products into markets that we have seen in the past as traditional markets. The more wheat that is subsidised from the United States, the more the pressure will be on to sell that product within new markets and markets that we have taken advantage of in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Hewson raised both those areas of concern and said that they needed to be debated. In fact, in the case of Japan, he said that this Australian Government should be putting a greater effort into negotiating with and pressing Japan to reduce continuing barriers to our exports. Apparently, in the eyes of Mr Keating, that is a crime. I am quite happy to be associated with Dr Hewson in that claim, because it is my view&mdash;and I think the view of everyone on this side of the chamber&mdash;that the Australian Government ought to do more to persuade Japan to reduce its barriers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In saying that, it does not mean that we in the Opposition do not recognise and appreciate the extent of our trade with Japan. Japan is our No. 1 trading partner and we have a significant surplus in our favour. From our perspective, that is good. But that does not justify the continuation of the existing barriers to other areas of export&mdash;exports from either Australia or other countries. But this Government does not seem to believe those barriers are important. That is what Dr Hewson was  criticising, and he has every right and resposibility to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one looks at this Government's trade documents&mdash;particularly the document headed <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia and North-East Asia in the 1990s: Accelerating Change</EMPHASIS>, referred to by some as the `Son of Garnaut' document, which was put out earlier this year and was supposed to be the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's major analysis of trade and trade opportunities within the east Asian region&mdash;and the extent to which they cover trade barriers imposed by Japan, those barriers are hardly mentioned at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as I can find, there is one weak sentence in the whole of this document of nearly 300 pages that mentions them at all. That demonstrates, starkly, the extent to which this Government regards those barriers as important. It obviously does not regard them as important at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In November last year the Government put out a draft document, which was to be its overall trade strategy document, headed <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Trade and Investment Development</EMPHASIS>. It looks at various markets, at Japan and the rest of this region in particular, but again obstacles imposed by Japan on our producers are hardly mentioned at all. On page 16 of the document, there is some mention of formal impediments to trade in relation to Japan. It says they are low, except for certain agricultural commodities such as beef, dairy products and rice. That is about the sum total of its mention of those obstacles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This can be contrasted with the attitude that is taken by the United States and in GATT by countries generally when they address Japan's protective mechanisms. I hope this will be taken in context because, as I said a minute ago, Japan has been gradually reducing barriers, and that is something we want to encourage, but where it has not reduced those barriers the Australian Government, in concert with other governments, should be urging it to do so. That is what Dr Hewson said Mr Keating should be doing, and that is what Mr Keating then condemned Dr Hewson for raising. </PARA>

When I look at the US 1990 annual review of trade impediments, under the heading, `Japan', I find a whole chapter of structural obstacles that exist within Japan, such as problems with its import policies and tariffs. There is particular mention of leather and leather footwear, wood and paper products, agricultural products, aluminium, seed grains, rice&mdash;on which we know there is a total prohibition&mdash;and fish products. It then goes into the standards, testing, labelling and certification difficulties that one has. It then looks at obstacles in the pharmaceutical industry and obstacles to food additives, fresh and preserved food. It looks at the Japanese Government procurement programs, its attitude to semi-conductors and to satellites. It looks at export subsidies in relation to shipbuilding, government procurement code implementation, and at questions relating to its lack of intellectual property protection. It looks at service barriers&mdash;construction, architectural and engineering services&mdash;at obstacles in relation to legal services, investment barriers, barriers against direct investment, other barriers such as semi-conductors, amorphous metals, optical fibres, aerospace, auto parts, soda ash, and the distribution system, which, of course, is critically important. One does not have to have it in the form of a transparent tariff barrier for it to be effective. It also looks at the law on large retail stores and at marketing practice restrictions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The US looks at all those obstacles, addresses them and argues, through negotiation, that it is important that Japan be persuaded to reduce those obstacles. Australia should be addressing them likewise. It is not just the United States that is putting these matters on the agenda. Look at the GATT itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will finish by simply looking at the concluding remarks by the Chairman of the Council of GATT in August 1990. This was a council meeting which was a trade policy review of Japan. I look at this document very briefly and just touch on some of the Chairman's comments. He mentions that members of the Council expressed their concerns in a number of areas, including the apparent lack of transparency in the administration of Japan's trade policies; the anti-competitive practices of certain Japanese firms which were not adequately addressed; a continuing high level of support for agriculture; the low level of intra-industry trade; the high tariffs for leather, footwear, jute products, textiles and clothing; import quotas on coal and some other products; low import content of government policies; tariff escalation; and the grey area measures. I will not go into all of these because those on the other side apparently do not want to hear them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are simply saying that Australia, together with other like-minded nations, should be addressing these obstacles. Mr Keating and his junior trade Minister&mdash;certainly not Senator Evans, because he has had no interest in trade whatsoever; there has been a whole series of subsidiary Ministers: one minute it was Mr Dawkins, then it was Mr Duffy, then it was Dr Blewett, and now it is Mr Kerin&mdash;should be at least pressing upon Japan the need to reduce these obstacles in order that trade can expand and that we can all benefit from that expanding trade. That is all that Dr Hewson was saying. It is a very reasonable thing for him to say. Instead of Dr Hewson being abused by Mr Keating for saying it, Mr Keating should take a leaf out of his book and get out there and do a bit of this hard work himself. </PARA>

The coalition believes that Australia needs an internationally competitive and vibrant manufacturing industry, including an internationally competitive and vibrant motor vehicle industry and, I would hope, a competitive and vibrant textile industry. It is clear from the last 10 years, during which time Australia's manufacturing base has been massively eroded as a result of the failures of the economic policies of which Paul Keating was the principal architect&mdash;the puller of the levers, of which he boasted; the organ grinder directing and dictating to Senator Button, the industry Minister monkey of the organ grinder and other Ministers&mdash;that this Government, of which, amazingly to me, Paul Keating is the leader&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Government, of which Mr Keating is the Leader, does not have any idea of how to correct the deep-seated malaise that it, itself, has created within industry. This Government and this Prime Minister are without precedent in their willingness to blow with the latest political wind; to abandon economic and political principles whenever they think it suits them; to bow to the dictates of the trade union movement when it comes to an inability or a failure to take necessary measures to reform and restructure industry; and, above all, to totally confuse and abuse Australian industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just look at some of the things that have been said by the Prime Minister in recent times. He has given the impression that this Government has a vastly different tariff policy to that of the coalition. He gave the impression&mdash;and it started at the by-election for Wills earlier this year&mdash;that this Government was a government that was going to maintain protection against the ravages of a tariff-reducing coalition. But how does that sit against the comments made over the last few years by the Prime Minister? Only last year, when talking to John Laws, the Prime Minister, before he was Prime Minister, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the end of (tariff) phasing, which is 1997 and 2000, we will have removed tariffs altogether.</PARA>
<PARA>It is the Prime Minister&mdash;again, before he became Prime Minister&mdash;who described tariffs as `poison'. He also declared just last year that if the textile, clothing and footwear industries needed tariffs to survive then `we are better off without them'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Button, the industry Minister, used to be a bit more honest than he has been in recent times. Only three months ago, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 23 June, he was reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tariffs are inward-looking mechanisms, not outward looking mechanisms.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it would be a cruel delusion to pretend&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that, by making what I would regard as a backward step in relation to tariffs in these industries, you would be in fact arresting what is a difficult and unfortunate decline in employment.</PARA>
<PARA>So much for the comments of the Prime Minister, and Senator Button in more recent weeks, as they have made a desperate attempt to make political capital out of the tariff debate.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In stark contrast to that political expediency and cynicism, the coalition's industry policies which are outlined in its Fightback proposals are the most comprehensive, internally consistent and logical policies for industry that have ever been produced by a political party in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the elements of the coalition's industry policy&mdash;only one&mdash;is a reduction of tariffs to negligible levels by the year 2000. By `negligible', we mean nought to 5 per cent. We have stated on many occasions that the level we are talking about for the car industry within that range is 5 per cent.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For all other industries, with the single exception of the TCF industries, the Keating Government's policy is to reduce tariffs to zero, and before this level would be reached by the coalition. Indeed, the Government, in its manufacturing industry statement of March last year, produced proposals to reduce the average tariff level to 2 per cent by 1996. That is an even speedier program of reduction than the coalition has been proposing. For all industries, setting aside the motor vehicle and TCF industries, the Keating Government's policy is to reduce tariffs to zero and before this level is proposed to be reached by the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In essence though&mdash;and I make this point very strongly&mdash;the tariff policy aspects of overall industry policy are very similar for the Government and the coalition. Even in the case of the car industry, any difference between the two is small. The Government says 15 per cent duty by the year 2000; we say 5 per cent. When one takes account of the time span involved&mdash;and we are talking about another eight years; when one takes account of the movements in exchange rates with a floating exchange rate regime; when one takes account of all of the other important economic variables that can change so dramatically from one year to another&mdash;interest rates, inflation, fiscal policy and the like; and when one takes into account the extent of natural protection that exists for Australian industries, that difference between 5 per cent and 15 per cent is quite meaningless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The overriding difference between the coalition's overall industry policy and that of the Government&mdash;there is an overriding difference here, if you set aside tariffs&mdash;is that the coalition will take a range of actions in the first two years of a Hewson government that, essentially, will make tariff protection unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those actions are: stripping $20 billion of taxes from the cost of making goods and services; abolishing the wholesale sales tax; abolishing payroll tax, which the Prime Minister himself acknowledges will either save or create 200,000 jobs; abolishing fuel excise; reducing the burden of regulation on industry; improving the efficiency of such vital support industries as transport and communications; bringing greater efficiency and competition to many government enterprises by transferring their ownership and operation to the private sector; returning and reforming the industrial relations system to produce greater flexibility in labour arrangements and, therefore, greater productivity and, in due course, higher real wages; and reforming the outdated structure of relations between the Commonwealth, State and local governments to remove duplication of cost, regulation, inefficiency, all of which hit industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamental difference between the Government and the coalition is that we are going to do all of those things in tandem, many of them before the reduction in tariffs. It is a very cohesive, comprehensive policy. That is the difference between the coalition's policy and the Government's policy. The Government's policy is to go down the tariff reduction route without taking any of those measures that improve the efficiency, productivity and international competitiveness of Australian industry. That is the way it has gone in the last decade and that is why we have had such a savage erosion of our industrial and general industry base here in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one conclusion we can draw from all of that, Mr Acting Deputy President, is that the fundamental difference between the coalition on the one hand and the Government on the other is that in the case of the coalition one has a clear direction being given, with conviction and with some leadership being shown right from the top, from Dr Hewson. There is a massive difference between that and the cynical political expediency of a desperate government and a desperate Prime Minister Keating. If anyone wants to read&mdash;</PARA>

Once one sees through that and one sees what is required in this country for a vibrant, internationally competitive and productive manufacturing sector, one realises that the policies the coalition is putting forward in a very comprehensive, cohesive way are the only way that we are going to correct the dreadful malaise that the policies of this Government over the last 10 years have wrought on Australian industry and on the Australian economy generally. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the motion moved by Senator Hill that we take note of the answer of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) to my question earlier in the day, I point out the inconsistencies of the statement that he makes in the area of trade. Senator Hill has already very adequately shown what little interest Senator Evans takes in the question of trade: Senator Evans vacates the field and leaves it to junior Ministers. He likes to strut and parade on the international stage and perhaps pursue his ultimate goal, which has now gone sour: he thought he might get the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts with Cambodia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, at the time that Senator Evans was floating his ideas, members from this side of the House pointed out that enormous difficulties were to be encountered with the Khmer Rouge, but they were things that simply would have got in the way of Senator Evans's strutting the stage in the way that he has become used to and enjoys. But when we come to trade, he does not find it glamorous; he apparently does not find it interesting either. So when he was at the conference which he mentioned just recently and made his pronouncement, he said that he wished that in the future APEC could become another European Community. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We might be as integrated and harmonised and as coherent economically, if not politically, as the European Community currently is. That is a big thought at this stage.</PARA>
<PARA>One sees how out of kilter that thought was with the very positive action that those who attended the APEC conference in Bangkok came up with. They have initiated short term programs that are aimed at removing barriers to intra-APEC trade, and I will list four of them. First, they have set up an electronic database of tariff schedules. Secondly, there has been a harmonisation of customs procedures to get rid of red tape. Thirdly, there is a program aimed at the elimination of administrative constraints. Fourthly, there has been the preparation of a guide to members' investment regulations and procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are all very sensible initiatives aimed at reducing the barriers to intra-Pacific trade. When I use the term `Pacific', I mean Pacific Rim. When I talk about the Pacific Basin, I mean all the countries that are either contained in or in fact border the Pacific. So it does include Latin America, where the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade recently said we must enhance those opportunities. But when we do an analysis of what occurs in the Pacific Basin, we see that there is indeed a need to reduce, very particularly, non-tariff barriers within the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The OECD reports will show that in OECD countries tariff barriers are now down to an average of 4.5 per cent, quite within the confines of the aim of our tariff policy of seeing tariffs reduced to between nought and 5 per cent. Senator Short very ably pointed out that there is a very close nexus between tariff policy and trade policy. The tariff policy is designed to ensure that all Australian businesses get an equal access to capital and human resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`The level playing field' is one of those phrases which is oft misquoted and misused; it is not understood. It is meant to apply to Australia in the sense that all Australian enterprises get a fair go at capital and resources&mdash;not the idea which is behind a high tariff policy of saying, `We are going to tax this group of people over here and we are going to pay it to that group of people over there because they are somehow special'. Why are they special? The way those policies operate is in fact to very often penalise those people who are at the lowest end of the socioeconomic scale; people who need not an impediment, but indeed help. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give honourable senators an example. Tariff policies as they apply to TCF mean that the cost of importing goods such as children's clothes and shoes from countries that are in the Pacific Basin bear such a tariff that, when a single mother, bringing up her child on a pension and with great difficulty, goes to one of the stores such as Target or K Mart to buy inexpensive but pleasant looking clothes for her child, she is effectively slapped with a consumption tax of the equivalent of at least 25 per cent. It is neither logical nor equitable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The strength of a tariff policy such as ours is that it does give all Australians fair access to investment capital and to human resources, and in turn that is linked to trade policy, which ensures that we then have markets for the goods that we make to export. Very clearly the Opposition is committed to an industry policy which will enable manufacturers to flourish, to prosper and to export sufficiently so that we can in turn stabilise our huge international debt and start to pay it off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the policy of how we maintain access to trade, I return to the point I made a moment ago, and that is that there is a need within the Pacific Basin and the Pacific Rim&mdash;which account for 70 per cent of Australian trade and a quarter of our foreign investment and include six of our largest export markets&mdash;to reduce barriers to trade in our own region. We support APEC as being the vehicle for doing just that. For Senator Evans to so misunderstand the trade side of his portfolio as to say APEC can become a European Community is just to show how uninformed he is in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the question of the trading patterns that Australia enjoys with countries in the Pacific Basin, we see that we require, as a medium sized but strategically placed nation, to be a global trader. Very simply, that means that not only do we need access to our traditional markets and need to increase those markets, which include Japan, ASEAN, Korea, the three Chinas, the NAFTA countries and the Latin American countries, but also we need to maintain our access to the European market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At all stages, the Opposition's policy is to encompass the pursuit of multilateral trade but with bilateral negotiations which are compatible with that multilateral thrust. Our policy has been consistent. Our policy with regard to closer economic relations with New Zealand is a very good example of how that policy works. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me go back to the question of the linkage between tariff policy and trade policy. It requires a philosophical framework to make those policies work. The philosophical framework within which I will always work is that of free enterprise. It is a lofty goal. The countries which have escaped from behind the Iron Curtain now seek to restructure their economies so that they too can compete. It is a goal which they see as worth pursuing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at tariff policy, trade policy, industrial relations policy and tax reform within that philosophical framework of free enterprise, we see that if we work at reducing impediments to trade for ourselves&mdash;that is, for Australians to be successful manufacturers and exporters&mdash;we need to free up that labour market, introduce taxation reform, keep access to our traditional markets and increase access to other markets, which include seeing a reduction in the common agricultural policy in Europe. The Europeans are simply running a social welfare program whereby they are asking the rest of the world to make those payments. We want to see a dismantling of EEP in the United States so that there is free trade in agriculture. We want to see Japan get rid of its total ban on rice imports and pursue its policy of liberalising access by lowering non-tariff barriers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, if we can negotiate through APEC a philosophy of free enterprise, which in turn means that international trade grows, thereby enabling all people's standard of living to grow, that is the route to pursue. That route leads to peace and neighbours remaining on good terms and, finally, it allows the standard of living of all people within, firstly, our region and, secondly, the rest of the world, to continue to grow. In that way, we will not face the prospect of unrest, further outbreaks of war and a diminution in the amount of international trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Free enterprise encapsulates lofty ideals. The Opposition's policies in understanding the link between taxation reform, labour market reform, tariff reform and access to markets&mdash;that is, our trade policy&mdash;give a formula that allows Australians to prosper and show that they are the strong and resilient people that they have been historically. Once the impediments and structures that have been placed upon the backs of good Australian people by way of government red tape and, as Dr Hewson says, green tape and black tape are removed, we will again see a very strong and proud nation. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans, as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, has failed to give any confidence in the answers that he has given in the Senate in recent days. Since the President of the United States, President Bush, early this month in the election campaign in the US announced in the EEP a huge increase in wheat subsidies to the great disadvantage of this country, our farmers and our trade effectiveness, there has not been an adequate protest or an alternative response strategy put by the present Government. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has failed, as has Senator Evans, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. The only positive approach has been put by the Opposition and, in particular, most effectively by the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has the Government done? In Question Time in the Senate, as in the House of Representatives, Ministers of this Government have taken cheap shots at the positive approach of the Opposition. What is that positive approach? I refer honourable senators and members of the public to two documents. The first is a three-page letter written by Dr John Hewson to President Bush direct. That three-page letter is a substantial and positive document that should be read carefully by anyone who wants to see the lead that the Opposition is giving to solving Australia's trade problems. The second document is an almost full-page article written by Dr Hewson and published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> last Thursday. It directly puts into a fuller context the trade initiatives that the Liberal and National parties are calling for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the present Government, especially the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Evans, we have seen failure, silence and inadequacy and cheap shots at distorting what the Opposition is saying about this matter. I will summarise our approach in response to the recent announcement by President Bush, like our approach to many other events involving Australian trade, in this way. The Opposition advocates a three-track approach in relation to other countries in the solutions of Australia's trade problems: firstly, internationally; secondly, regionally; and, thirdly, bilaterally with each individual nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In international terms, we wholeheartedly support initiatives for free trade in GATT in the Uruguay Round, if it is possible. We are stronger and more eloquent, and seeking more cooperation in the Uruguay Round for a positive outcome to GATT. Unlike the Government, that is not the only thing that we advocate. The present Government has put all its eggs into the GATT basket. We have to be realistic and see that there is not necessarily an optimistic outcome to the Uruguay Round, given the initiatives recently announced by the United States and the slowness with which the Europeans have only begun to define what might be a lowering of their subsidisation of agricultural products in other ways. To be effective, we must be ready in Australia to work together with like-minded nations, in particular with our major trading partners, to ensure that there is an effective solution for our trade, even if there is a delay in a positive outcome to the GATT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the second level of approach is a regional one with important associations such as the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation process. Australia has rightly initiated the APEC&mdash;the 15-member organisation made up of nations of the Asia-Pacific region. I say to Government senators that we are even stronger, even more eloquent and even more specific about what we wish to see from APEC. Let me give an example. Senator Hill has rightly lamented the slowness with which APEC has put on the agenda clear discussion which leads to action in trade liberalisation. Trade liberalisation has not flowed from APEC discussion, even though there have been three years of discussion so far. Positive action did not flow from even the Bangkok meeting that was held last week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, I welcome the setting up of an APEC secretariat in Singapore. I welcome the fact that APEC has three new members from last November in terms of the three Chinas. Trade liberalisation should be on the agenda. This should lead to a decision being made and a greater free trade environment within this region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the third area. I am afraid that the present Government has omitted completely, at least from any of its public statements in the last two weeks, any kind of imagination to produce a worthwhile outcome to initiatives that we can take on a one-to-one basis&mdash;one Australia with one Japan, one Australia with one Korea, one Australia with each of the ASEAN countries, one Australia with one United States, one Australia with Mexico, one Australia with Chile or one Australia with any other of our individual trading links. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In concert with Senator Hill and Senator Bishop, I continue to advocate the necessity for the Government to put the third track on its agenda. The Government should not have all of its eggs in a GATT basket. It should not just make some warm noises about APEC. There needs to be action on and a solution to Australia's trading problems. One of the essential elements in the three-track approach of the Opposition, which I advocate most strongly, is the exploration and active finalisation of bilateral free trade agreements with our trading partners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A year ago in August after my return from a visit to seven Latin American countries I included in a comprehensive statement advocacy of a free trade bilateral agreement between Australia and Mexico and another between Australia and Chile. I have long advocated that we keep up a precise dialogue with our major trading partners in north and east Asia&mdash;with Japan especially, China, Korea and Taiwan. This should be done with each one of them on a bilateral basis consistent with what we are saying and doing in APEC and consistent with our goals in the GATT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today I was able to meet with the Chilean Minister for Mining, Mr Hamilton, who is an experienced senior Minister of the Chilean Government. The Minister was accompanied by officials and representatives of the mining industry. I was delighted with his response when I asked, `Is the Government of Chile willing to negotiate a free trade agreement with Australia?'. He answered that question positively and clearly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last Thursday I met with the Ambassador of Mexico. For some time I have been putting to representatives of Mexico that we ought to be moving towards a direct free trade agreement with those countries on a bilateral basis. Of course, that also includes the North America Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA. Why has Senator Evans closed his mind to these bilateral initiatives? Why does he take cheap shots at the Opposition and, in particular, at Dr Hewson?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will conclude with these final remarks. The Opposition does not have an `either or' policy but a `both' policy in regard to international regional or bilateral discussions on trade. We do not have an `either or' approach to NAFTA and ASEAN. We have a `both' approach. We do not have an `either or' approach to any of the potential trading partners with this country. We have a `both' approach. We have all of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With my colleagues in the Opposition, I continue to put a request to Senator Evans and to the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, that they stop their policy and behaviour of failure and being frozen into silence about anything other than GATT. They should start to act by standing up for Australia's national interests. They should be responsive to the wishes of the Australian people by acting along the lines that my colleagues and I have been urging. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 19 June I asked the Minister whether it was correct that the issue of imported embryos, live pigs and breeding material was raised at a prime ministerial level and not purely at a department level.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The answer to that question is no. I have to say that I told Senator Boswell privately after Question Time yesterday that, when I referred to discussions between the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service and the company Danpork and the representative of the Danish pig industry, those discussions were with the quarantine service&mdash;and they were. I also understand that officers of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy were there. There was no ministerial discussion on this issue at all.</PARA>

<PARA>In the third to last paragraph the letter goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Having regard to Government to Government discussions over the years and in particular recent Minister to Minister discussions it will be necessary to give some priority to the longstanding Danish requests. With regard to new genetic material it would be useful to gain an appreciation of whether there is any demand from the pig industry in this area from any member country of the European Community as it may be that this aspect is better handled on a Community basis.</PARA>
<PARA>It is very clear from that letter that there has been or was some prime ministerial intervention or some Minister to Minister intervention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today I asked the Minister representing the Prime Minister (Senator Button) whether he stood by his answer to me of Friday, 19 June.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 19 June or thereabouts, I made an application for information under freedom of information and those papers were given to me about two weeks ago.

But the question which we on this side of the chamber asked and which this Government has failed to answer is: what is behind this latest move and what is behind the pressure on AQIS to change the rules on the importation of live pigs? Is it because&mdash;and I asked this of Senator Cook today and he refused to answer&mdash;the pressure has come from Brown and Hatton, a company notorious for its links with the Danes and for its links with Mr Paul Keating, who is now Prime Minister of this country? There is undeniably a stench which hangs over this affair&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a stench which hangs over Porkergate which is not related solely to the natural products of breeding pigs but is related to the unnatural way in which this Government runs the affairs of this nation. There is a stench hanging over this Government because it refuses to come clean and tell the Australian people why it is that all of a sudden Danish requests that have been around since the 1980s leaped to the top of the pile in 1990. It refuses to tell the Australian public what the involvement of the Prime Minister is and what the involvement of other Ministers is. Honourable senators opposite say to this Senate that there has been no involvement; yet the letters that we have tabled show quite clearly that there has been.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, we now find the absurd situation in which letters from AQIS have gone to the industry saying that it is doing this, firstly, because Denmark has an excellent disease record and, secondly, because there has been strong pressure from within the industry. We know quite clearly that Denmark has a terrible disease record in terms of pigs. But, more importantly, we know, from the letters I tabled in the Senate today, that there was no strong pressure from the industry. The Pig Improvement Company, which is one of the leading pig breeders in the nation, the Australian Pork Producers Federation, the Western Australian Pig Producers Association and the New South Wales Farmers Association all oppose the suggestion that we should import live pigs from Denmark and all wrote to AQIS saying that they opposed the suggestion that live pigs should be imported from Denmark. Yet the argument from AQIS was that there was strong pressure from the industry. I do not believe that there was strong widespread pressure from the industry, but I suspect there was strong pressure from one portion of the industry. What portion of the industry was that? Brown and Hatton, the same company which is notorious for its links with the Danes and for its links with the Prime Minister, Mr Paul Keating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not good enough for the Government to try to sweep this under the carpet.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matters that Senator Boswell and Senator O'Chee have raised are yet further examples of what is turning into an extraordinary situation where normal procedures clearly have not been followed. The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service quite clearly and uncomplicatedly stated that the matter had been resurrected, having been around for quite some time, as a result of prime ministerial interest, and then suddenly, after a formal request was made after the matter was clearly shown to be of political significance in this chamber, the story was changed. This is a clear instance of where there is a requirement for the reasons for the change in the story to be presented; it is simply not good enough to say, `We made a slight error in saying `Prime Ministerial'; that is wrong', and then not say whether or not it was ministerial&mdash;but leaving the clear inference, because it chose to withdraw only the reference to Prime Ministerial intervention, that there must nonetheless have been some ministerial intervention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The procedures that have not been followed are very important, because there is clearly an attempt to gloss over some major concerns in respect of the animal health area. As Senator O'Chee said, there has been no pressure from the industry, apart from one company that seeks to benefit from the change, and that happens to be the company half owned by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). There is no pressure from the industry for this major change for the importation of genetic material or live pigs. As I understand it&mdash;perhaps Senator Boswell or Senator O'Chee could confirm this&mdash;the UK has expressed continuing concerns about Danish genetic material and the importation of Danish pigs. That is a matter that those National Party senators know more about than I do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I am concerned about is the continuing improper activity that seems to flow through this Porkergate proposition. In the first place, we have had an admission that full information was not provided to the Foreign Investment Review Board in dealing with this whole Danpork proposal. It has been admitted that Mr Keating's interest was hidden from the two applications made for Foreign Investment Review Board approval. There were no annual reports from the operating companies in the group for years. They were formed in 1988. The annual reports of those operating companies are only now dribbling out and they are full of the most extraordinary matters which, I let the Senate know, I intend to raise here in the very near future. These reports are dribbling out despite the fact that the Australian Securities Commission instructed companies in November last year that they should make early reports and that a failure to report in good time would lead to deregistration. I think we are entitled to know why these companies seem still to be able to get away without reporting without being rubbed out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Talking about procedures not having been followed, we know that the Prime Minister's report to the House of Representatives disclosure of interest authorities was grossly inadequate in that it said simply that he had an investment instead of saying that he had a 50 per cent ownership, and in that it said that he was not a director when in fact he had a nominee as a director. We know all those things. But we only found out because we pursued the matter. We had to hunt and search to find the facts&mdash;facts which in many areas are still being withheld from us. Either the Prime Minister is simply obsessively secretive or he has something to hide in this matter. Whichever it is, it appears to be grossly unhealthy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was also a failure by the present Prime Minister, Mr Keating, to report, as required, immediately to the previous Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, when he took up his major stake&mdash;if I can use that word&mdash;in the pig company. This, of course, was done when he was Treasurer and the requirements of the Cabinet office are that any change in a Minister's assets must be reported immediately to the Prime Minister. I understand that Mr Hawke was not advised of Mr Keating's sudden and substantial interest in the pig companies, in a situation which is now known quite properly as Porkergate, and it obviously would not have been to Mr Keating's advantage to advise him as at that stage he was busy preparing to slaughter Mr Hawke rather than the pigs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation now is that not only are there financial problems but also serious quarantine questions have been raised by Senator Boswell and Senator O'Chee. These concerns underline the fact that there seems to be a specific inability for the Prime Minister's company to go about this thing properly and an incredible inability for this Government to handle this matter properly. It is getting to the situation where surely sooner or later there must be some serious questions about whether some kind of inquiry into Porkergate might not be appropriate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support my colleagues Senator Boswell, Senator O'Chee and Senator Baume in relation to the question that was asked by Senator Boswell concerning the importation of Danish pigs. It is obvious to me that there has been some prime ministerial interference in the position of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. I want to emphasise that over the last two years at Estimates committee hearings I and a number of my colleagues have consistently asked questions of officers of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy relating to what appears to be a weakening in the stance that AQIS has had over a significant number of years&mdash;in fact, it goes back 30 or 40 years&mdash;to the point where we are putting at risk not only our pig industry but also a number of other livestock industries. It goes even further than that. It relates to seed that is being imported and to the blue-green aphid, which is currently devastating much of the pasture base in this country. When we as a nation have a country that is an island and thus has such a natural advantage, why would we want to take any risk whatsoever by importing product that carries a risk in whatever nature?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We get told continually that we cannot use AQIS as a tariff barrier. Nobody is asking anybody to use it as a tariff barrier. What we are asking and what has been asked consistently by the industries involved in this country is that we protect and look after that natural advantage that we have. Why do we have to put it at risk? That is the question that has to be answered. Why would anybody in this nation, regardless of their political background or where they come from, want to put at risk the natural advantage we have by introducing disease and pests into this country?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should learn from the mistakes that were made in the early days when the knowledge was not available. I am referring to what occurred by the introduction of rabbits and foxes into this nation. Why do we want to repeat the same mistakes over and over again? We can ask anybody in this nation at this time, particularly those living on the eastern side, what devastation the aphids are doing to the pasture lands. The position that has been adopted with regard to AQIS and the interference that is occurring is just criminal. It is too late to think about it afterwards. Why do we want to commit harakiri in this country instead of protecting our genetic base and what we have built up in Australia over the last 200 years?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate my colleagues on the research that they have carried out on this matter. I just wanted to add my own viewpoint. As far as I am aware, there is not one industry organisation or responsible leader of any of these organisations that supports the current position that is being adopted. One must ask: what is the political gain to the people involved? What is the financial gain to the people involved? Why do they want to go down a course of potential devastation to a whole host of industries in this nation by becoming lax in enforcing quarantine requirements for bringing these various things into this country, whether they be live pigs, embryo, seed or other forms of imports?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to stand here with the people who have raised this particular matter and others on this side of the House and say that it is about time we took control of our Quarantine and Inspection Service in a proper manner so that it is allowed to carry out its function without interference by politicians who have something to gain from it. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need to condemn comments by the Prime Minister that Australia `shouldn't have a Senate'.</PARA>
<PARA>The attack last week by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on this institution, on the Senate of Australia, cannot go unanswered. It typifies both Mr Keating's ignorance and his arrogance in taking the opportunity of a school visit to this city to attack the Senate in the following terms. First, he attacked the Senate by saying that it frustrated the House of Representatives through parties in which he did not have a majority. Secondly, he basically said that we should not have a Senate. In other words, he made an attack on the very existence of this chamber. Thirdly, he said that the Senate was an impediment to the smooth operation of the parliamentary system. What he means by that is that it is an impediment to his always getting his way in the terms that he requires. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what this chamber is all about; it is a chamber of accountability. It requires accountability of government&mdash;both in its legislative program and in its finances&mdash;in running the financial affairs of government. Principally, this Senate is proud of its contribution in both those functions. It has a highly developed system. In some ways it has been an international leader in the systems that it has developed in an effort to require proper accountability of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this Senate were not fulfilling that function, what other body within this democracy would be doing so? The answer, of course, is simply none, because the Prime Minister basically controls and rides roughshod over his parliamentary Party, over the Caucus. His view is paramount; it prevails at all times. He treats the House of Representatives in exactly the same way. He has the numbers in the House of Representatives; he therefore refuses to permit proper debate and proper scrutiny by that chamber, using those numbers to thwart such proper debate and functioning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see it at the end of each parliamentary session with the number of Bills that are forced through under the guillotine in the House of Representatives with literally almost no debate at all, no opportunity to scrutinise the legislation, no opportunity to require proper accountability of Ministers and no opportunity for any committee stage debate to look at the detail of the legislation. This happens in each of the two sessions&mdash;in the middle of the year and at the end of the year. The legislation is simply pushed through and the Prime Minister regards that as his definition of democracy. This chamber does not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This chamber has a role, a function, to ensure that that does not occur, that within the democratic process in this country there is some attempt at scrutinising the role of government. If this chamber were not doing it, no-one would be doing it and Australian democracy would be the loser. It is interesting that the vast majority of Australians agree with that point of view. They recognise the importance of this chamber as a safeguard and they want this chamber to remain, whether or not the Prime Minister is of the same view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the statement that the Prime Minister made last week to schoolchildren, we know that his view is the traditional Labor view, the view that was stated in the platform of the Labor Party up until 1980&mdash;that is, that the Senate of Australia should be abolished. It should be abolished because, in the view of those in the Labor Party, it provides some constraint or restraint on their behaviour and Prime Minister Keating is not prepared to tolerate that restraint. Whenever the Prime Minister runs up against some form of accountability, some form of questioning, his answer is always to attack and abuse. He does it again: in this instance, it is the Senate, the institution of the Senate, that is the target. We are not concerned about individuals&mdash;he can attack individuals within this place&mdash;but he attacks the safeguard contained within the Constitution of Australia that gives the Australian people some security that a Prime Minister will not ride roughshod over their interests, as this Prime Minister would seek to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister divides his attack into three parts. He says that his program is frustrated. Mr Acting Deputy President, if you look at the functioning of this Senate, you will find that it does not frustrate the program of government; it accepts the program of government but, where possible, will improve the legislation. It will do so not only in this chamber but also within its committee system. It will do so within the standing committees that have been developed. It will do so through the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. In the case of subordinate legislation, it will do so through the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. This Senate does it well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Regulations and Ordinances Committee and the Scrutiny of Bills Committee ensure the protection of the civil liberties of individuals in this country. In that area, this Senate led the world and it is a precedent that has been taken up in so many other democracies. We are pleased about that; we are pleased that the people of Australia get that added protection that Mr Keating does not seem to think they should be entitled to. We will fight to preserve that and we have no shame in doing that because it is in the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister says we should not have the Senate at all. That is a prejudice from the old Labor position. It is not the first time he has said that or the first time he has spoken offensively about this chamber. Speaking offensively is probably what he does best.

Senator Patterson will obviously remember that article which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> back in 1978 which foreshadowed the contribution that Senator Evans would make within this chamber. He said: `The way to abolish the Senate or at least muzzle it is to white ant it from within'. That is a now Minister of the Crown speaking in that way. That was his attitude on coming into this chamber. He was prepared to take all the opportunities and advantages of this chamber to pursue his political objectives whilst having put down in writing that his real objective was to destroy the Senate. I guess that typifies Senator Evans. Senator Kemp has a pretty strong argument that Senator Evans in fact takes more benefits than most in the form of titles&mdash;`the honourable', `Senator' and `Queen's Counsel'. He will take the benefits side, but he will not take the deficit side. Senator Evans has also stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If one believes, as I do, along with all good Labor men and women true, that the Senate ought to be abolished, or at the very least deprived, of its capacity to destroy properly elected governments, there is surely no better forum in which to promote these insidious heresies than the institution itself.</PARA>

<PARA>this is Senator Evans talking about others being pompous&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">but now it is obvious to most people that it has become a very dangerous one as well.</PARA>
<PARA>What arrant nonsense. Of course, I have to concede that Senator Evans did try to get out of this chamber. He did seek preselection to move to the other place, but his own side would not have him. I will not go on, because many of my colleagues wish to make a contribution to this debate in defence of this institution and its contribution to Australian political life, particularly to detail some of the ways in which it improves the political life of this country. I will end my contribution with a quote from one of the great men of all time, John Stuart Mill, when he was looking at the case for upper chambers. What he says fits particularly aptly alongside the attitude of Mr Keating. He states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The consideration which tells most, in my judgment, in favour of two Chambers (and this I do regard as of some moment) is the evil effect produced upon the mind of any holder of power, whether an individual or an assembly, by the consciousness of having only themselves to consult.</PARA>
<PARA>Does that not fit the mould of Keating so well?  He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important that no set of persons should, in great affairs, be able, even temporarily, to make their sic volo prevail without asking any one else for his consent. A majority in a single assembly, when it has assumed a permanent character&mdash;when composed of the same persons habitually acting together, and always assured of victory in their own House&mdash;easily becomes despotic and overweening&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that sounds very much like Keating&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">if released from the necessity of considering whether its acts will be concurred in by another constituted authority. The same reason which induced the Romans to have two consuls makes it desirable there should be two Chambers: that neither of them may be exposed to the corrupting influence of undivided power, even for the space of a single year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My share of the time is up, but I leave the Senate with that comment because it is this Senate that places some constraint upon the potentially corrupting influence and undivided power of this Prime Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have actually got my eyes open; I just cannot stand looking at those opposite. Nobody is seriously proposing to abolish the Senate. But I have to say that when I look around the world at democracies which operate quite effectively without two chambers of parliament, it reminds me of Kim Beazley Sr saying that Australians should be so concerned about their poor colleagues in New Zealand that we should mount an armada and go over there to defend them in their democracy because they only have one House of parliament, they do not have any States and they have one vote, one value. What a shocking condemnation of their democracy that they should have those three things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, he said that in a State where these great defenders of the checking role of the upper House have, for 100 years, conspired to ensure that they always have the numbers in that upper House and that even when the Opposition&mdash;the Labor Party in that instance&mdash;gets 50 per cent at two elections in a row, it cannot win control of the upper House just in case it might be a constraint on the conservatives. It is all right for it to be a constraint on Labor governments, but not on conservatives, who have had control of that upper House for 100 years without a word of concern about the lack of check and balance upon conservative governments in Western Australia that have rorted the system for 100 years. </PARA>

When one studies the democratic processes of unicameral and bicameral democracies, one sees that the procedural significance and the democratic distinction is very hard to find.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, the Prime Minister went on to talk about the House of Representatives `putting on a better show'. I think the Prime Minister revealed himself as someone who does not fully understand or appreciate the gravity of what goes on in both Houses of this Parliament. After all, we are formulating laws in regard to the very things that Senator McMullan talked about. We are discussing issues to do with such things as unemployment, tariffs and the GST. We are discussing a whole lot of important things. Yet the Prime Minister says to schoolchildren, `We should not have a Senate because the House of Representatives puts on a better show'. Surely that is denigrating the whole function of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What he is really saying is that parliament is really all about a theatrical performance&mdash;and we all know what goes on down in the other place at Question Time&mdash;rather than the business of better government. I think his reference to a `better show', linked with his remark about smoothing the processes of government, indicates a megalomaniacal wish to have the processes of his Government smoothed without the intervention of this Senate casting a critical eye over those legislative processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the Senate should be an impediment to those smooth processes because, as we all know, so much of what passes for debate in the House of Representatives is simply decided as a result of number crunching. When the time is up, the numbers vote and the party with the majority simply gets the vote irrespective of how many good points are raised by whichever party happens to be in opposition at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unfortunate that the very important role of the Senate in relation to legislation&mdash;namely, the close scrutiny of legislation by a chamber in which for some years no party has had sufficient numbers to get legislation through without the support of another party&mdash;is not noticed a lot more by people in the media. The media still has over-interest in what goes on in the House of Representatives to the exclusion of an awareness of the very important legislative changes and amendments which are made in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For quite a number of years it has been the Senate in which important amendments and changes to legislation have been made. The Senate has upheld the appropriate processes of Parliament, which have been neglected in the House of Representatives simply because of the nature of the election process in that chamber. For instance, in the last 12 months we dealt with a very important package of fisheries legislation. The Senate considered a package of six Bills which was designed to restructure totally the management of fisheries which come under Federal government control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation went through the House of Representatives in 45 minutes with no amendment whatsoever. The legislation was then introduced into the Senate and was referred to the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. The Committee sought evidence from the CSIRO, State fishery experts, tourism interests, conservation interests, and  professional and recreational fishermen. As a result, over 80 amendments were proposed to that package of fisheries Bills. Those Bills were incomparably improved because of the presence of this Senate. Australia would not have been well served had the processes of government been smoothed, to use Mr Keating's terminology, and if the Senate had not existed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A larger number of amendments were inserted into a package of social service legislation as a consequence of the Senate committee processes. We can look at recent debates in this chamber on superannuation. Irrespective of what one might think about the end result, very significant changes were made to superannuation legislation as a consequence of the fact that in this place serious debate must occur and serious amendments must be considered. Nobody has the power simply to push things through on the numbers without that proper consideration being given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industrial relations legislation is another example of very significant changes being made. When Senator Peter Baume&mdash;a senator who had been a member of this chamber for a very long time&mdash;gave his valedictory address he remarked how significant it was that the Senate was the place in recent years in which the major portion of changes and improvement to legislation occurred. He said that it was in the Senate that the proper government of this country was managed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say something about the role of the Senate, Independents, minor parties and, indeed, oppositions. It is important to recognise that there is a debate going on out there in the community. This debate is raised in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>. I refer to the issue of what in fact constitutes a mandate and whether the party that gains the largest number of seats in the lower House has a mandate to carry through its legislation without any intrusion by the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would simply observe that because of the single member electorate system it is possible for a party to gain control of the House of Representatives with a very small proportion of the total vote. Indeed, if there were a three-party contest in each electorate&mdash;and often there are more parties than that&mdash;all that a party would need to gain to take control of the lower House is 25 per cent of the vote plus one vote in 50 per cent of the seats plus one seat and 25 per cent of the vote from the party that gets the second preferences. That amounts to just over 12 per cent of the vote. So, theoretically it would be possible for a party to gain control of the lower House with somewhere between 12 and 13 per cent of the vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, because of the proportional representation system, to gain control of the Senate a party must gain the support of more than 50 per cent of the voters in more than 50 per cent of the electorates. This is, indeed, the democratic chamber. Consequently, it is appropriate that when legislation comes to this chamber the majority here should determine whether that legislation passes or whether that legislation passes with amendment. Let me be specific. The goods and services tax was raised in the editorial in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>.

The Labor Party and the Democrats combined would have a mandate from the majority of Australians to block or to modify the GST legislation, whatever that will be when we see it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To argue otherwise, as people from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> and a few others have attempted to do, would mean that the Independents and minor parties must go back on their word to the electorate. Indeed, if one follows the logic of it, the Opposition would also have to go back on its word to the electorate and vote for legislation to which it was philosophically opposed.

What is of great concern is that the Prime Minister should have used the words he did to a group of schoolchildren. Those words indicate an inappropriate level of behaviour on the part of the Prime Minister with schoolchildren and an unwillingness to accept the gravity of the legislation which is dealt with in this place. Instead those words place emphasis on the theatrical performance in the House of Representatives, rather than on that important aspect of dealing with important legislation&mdash;legislation which does indeed deal with the issues of unemployment, tariff reductions, stimulating industry, trade and all those other things that Senator McMullan indicated. These are the important things. I think the Prime Minister's remarks do not indicate that he accepts these as the important issues which they really are. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that Australia does not need a Senate is really the statement of a man who has no regard whatsoever for the parliamentary checks and balances inherent in a democratic society, a man who believes that all power should reside in the Executive&mdash;that is, in the Government&mdash;and therefore that the Parliament should be subservient to the Executive, and a man who is so consumed by the lust for power that he will do anything to trample underfoot any curbs to that power. Coalition speakers today in this debate will deal with a host of concerns that all Australians should have about Mr Keating's desire to see the Senate abolished. In the five minutes available to me, I wish to devote my remarks to just one of these issues and that is the rights of the Australian States and Territories in our Federation or Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The founding fathers quite deliberately and correctly decided in the 1890s, when the concept of federation was being debated, that the new federation, which was born on 1 January 1901, should have a bicameral parliamentary system. It did this for very good reasons. The Senate was to be two things: the House of review and the House which protected the rights of the States. I am sure that the role of the Senate as a House of review will be the main focus in this debate today. The gross incompetence of this Government over the last 10 years that it has been in office has only been curbed at all by the vigilance and diligence of the Senate, which has corrected time and time again dreadful legislation which abused people's civil liberties, which was sloppy legislation, which was regulatory legislation and which was just sheer bad legislation. I will not go any further on the House of review aspect; others will do that. It is in terms of the rights of the States that I want to address my remarks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There would have been no federation, of course, without the agreement to establish the Senate, because the smaller States, in particular, would not have been prepared to join. They feared that the larger States of New South Wales and Victoria would have all the say, and that their rights would be neglected and, indeed, abused. That is why we have an equal number of senators from each State, regardless of the population of each individual State. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although it is correct to say that, over recent decades at least, voting in the Senate has been along party lines rather than along State lines&mdash;I certainly acknowledge that&mdash;I think that equally there is no doubt at all that the existence of the Senate has acted as an important watchdog over the rights of the States. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe, contrary to honourable senators opposite, that that is an essential requirement of any true federal system. The Prime Minister does not want that because he does not want to protect the rights of the States. Mr Keating is and always has been a centralist through and through. He believes that all power, all knowledge, all wisdom, resides in a central government, a Federal government, in Canberra, and his whole political life has been built around that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He has not been on his own, because for decades it was the official policy of the Labor Party to abolish the Senate. That has only changed in recent years, but there are still members of this Senate on the Labor side who have fought long and hard within their own party over many years to have the Senate abolished. Senator Evans is perhaps the classic example; he is on the record time and time again for wanting to abolish the Senate. He first put it to the national Labor conference back in 1979. As recently as 31 May 1988, which is only four years or so ago, he said in this place that he believed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . along with all good Labor men and women true, that the Senate ought to be abolished . . .</PARA>
<PARA>So let there be no doubt that it is the underlying wish of many people in this chamber&mdash;Senator Walsh I know is another one&mdash;to abolish the Senate. Very importantly, that would have the effect of abolishing the rights of the States to be protected in a true federal system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is an essential difference between this Government and the alternative coalition government. We on this side of the chamber happen to believe that in a true federation there is a proper and responsible role for each of the three spheres of government, and that all power and knowledge does not and should not reside in the Federal Government. We believe that the States do have a very real and important role to play and that the rights of the States, without any doubt at all, would be trampled on and trammelled if the proposal mooted yet again by the Prime Minister, that this nation of ours does not need a Senate, were to come into operation. One could not think of a more undemocratic action for any Prime Minister to propose. That is the reason the coalition has moved this amendment, and that is why the Prime Minister's statement needs to be roundly condemned by all Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take issue this evening with some remarks made by Senator McMullan. In my view, Senator McMullan on many occasions comes into this place under the pretence of being a reasonable man. He puts his view in a calm and, what seems to be, reasonable manner only to disguise the fact that there is not a lot of reason at all behind what he says. That is in contrast to someone like Senator Ray, who does not necessarily put his view in a way that comes over as being calm and reasoned but by and large usually is, even though one might not agree with the reasons in themselves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to draw attention to some of the remarks made by Senator McMullan. The first remark he made is that we should have a sense of perspective and that sense of perspective, he says, should tell us that this is not an issue we should be talking about. We should, for example, be talking about what the Government should be doing for the one million people it has made unemployed. But, of course, that is his version, his sense of perspective. His sense of perspective clearly does not put at the base of all issues having a properly functioning parliamentary system. He says there is no plan to get rid of the Senate&mdash;and I will come to that in a minute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply make the point first off that, by any sense of perspective, in order for people to enjoy the rights and freedoms that they now do enjoy, an absolute precondition for issues to be properly debated&mdash;sensible and important issues like unemployment, trade policy, tariff policy, all those sorts of things&mdash;is that we have a proper parliamentary system. So the question of whether we should have a bicameral system in fact comes before all of those issues and, from my sense of perspective, therefore, is more important in itself than any one of those issues on its own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, Senator McMullan says that no such plan exists. Since when has this chamber been restricted to discussing things where there is a plan on behalf of the Executive to undertake a particular course of action? It is not my understanding that the Senate is so restricted, nor do I think is it the understanding of anyone else here. I am sorry that Senator McMullan in his 4 1/2 years has not learnt that this place is not restricted to discussing things that the Executive has a plan for. This place is not restricted by that at all. I do not know why he even raises that as a point of debate which he thinks has any merit. He then goes on with an overdramatisation of the case. He says that, because we want to discuss this issue, we are bringing in the thought police, and is it not shocking that because someone has a different view from ours we have to discuss it&mdash;quite missing the point altogether. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not have a problem with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) having a different view from mine on any issue. In fact, it only confirms in my mind that my views are right and his are wrong. Of course there is going to be debate on this issue and all others&mdash;and of course there should be&mdash;but I take offence at Senator McMullan suggesting that this is not an appropriate place to have such a debate. He suggests that we can have a debate on the important issues&mdash;for example, what type of parliamentary system we want&mdash;when we are talking to schoolchildren but that we should not have such a debate in this chamber. In my view, that clearly is not an acceptable proposition for him to be putting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us get to the question of what are the important issues. He seems to have a false logic of saying, `This is not an important enough issue for us to be discussing here'. I have already dealt with why I think the parliamentary system is the prime issue that we should always keep in our minds, that we should always be promoting debate on and that we should always be trying to get the public more interested in. But it begs the question: if it is not important enough for us to be discussing it here, why is it important enough for the Prime Minister to be raising it with schoolchildren? If the most important issues of the day are unemployment, tariff policy, monetary policy and the incompetence of this Government, why does the Prime Minister not go and explain the one million unemployed to the schoolchildren and leave the distracting issue&mdash;which Senator McMullan sees it as being&mdash;of the Senate's survival or otherwise to others? So, quite frankly, I found Senator McMullan's calm and quiet exposition of his case totally flawed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last minute or two, let me address myself to what I think is the best example around of why we obviously do need the Senate, why we need to constantly remind people of why we need it and the good work it does, and why we especially need to remind them when someone in the position of Prime Minister raises with impressionable schoolchildren the question of not needing the Senate. That is obviously the appropriate time to put an alternative case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no better alternative case than the sales tax legislation currently before this place. Just on a procedural basis, I think it was something like 18 months ago that this Government said that it could reform the wholesale sales tax system in a way we say cannot be done. It spent all that time doing it. It brought the legislation in here; it tried to guillotine it through with the support of the Democrats and I think some of the independents; and those Bills were referred to a select committee. What did we find out after that was done? The Bills were drastically flawed: they either do not say or did not say in their original state what the Government wanted them to, or the Government finally realised what it had done and is now trying to undo that legislation by means of amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That sort of review will not happen if we give unbridled power to one House. The legislation will just be shoved through on a guillotine. People will suffer because of the ineptitude not of draughtsmen here but of Government instructions, and they will then wait even longer to get the legislation repaired and put in the state it should have been in the first place. There is no better example than the sales tax package of how a lower House on its own is manifestly incapable of producing legislation to be inflicted on the community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator McMullan opened the debate today by telling us that the matter before the Senate was trivial and no-one outside this place would believe that we would debate it. Let me make it quite clear that today we are debating democracy. The comment of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was not a throwaway line that he often uses, although his staff went to great pains to say, `Oh, it was just an off-the-cuff statement'. We know that from 1919 it has been Labor policy to abolish the Senate. It was not until 1980 that Senator Evans at a Labor Party conference said, `Well, look, we know that this is pretty unpopular with the Australian people and therefore we ought to take it out of our policy, but there is no reason for us not to white ant the Senate from within'. That is why when he came to the Senate he used those words. Senator Coates, as we all know, has made similar statements in this place on many occasions. As so many of the Government members opposite agree that there really is no need for the Senate, I wonder why they bothered to enter it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Walsh earlier made some odd interjection about the States' House and said, `When has it ever been a States' House?' Let me tell Senator Walsh that in 1976, when the Fraser Government, of which I was a member, tried to have a referendum on issues on the Senate, Fraser lost that referendum, even though the Labor Party was in agreement with him, because several of the States' members in this Senate, members of the Liberal and National parties in this Senate, voted against their Government and divided on Senate State lines alone. Indeed, many Western Australian, Tasmanian, Queensland and South Australian senators crossed the floor and were instrumental in arguing the case with the Australian people that the Senate and all its powers ought to be retained.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, let me come to perhaps an even more important issue. Mr Keating has been very concerned that the Senate interferes with his powers in the lower House. His main reason for wanting to get rid of the Senate is that he cannot continue to just push legislation through the lower House, guillotine it if there appears to be any substantive debate, and get it passed without debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since this Government has been in power, 2,954 amendments have been passed in this place. That is, nearly 3,000 amendments to Government legislation have been passed in this place since this Government has been in power. There have been 1,922 amendments put and passed by the Government. The Government passed through the lower House such shoddy legislation&mdash;as I say, without debate, guillotined through&mdash;that it was not until the legislation was fully debated in the committee stage of this place that the 1,922 amendments were agreed to by the Government. The Government believed 1,922 amendments were needed, and they were debated and put up in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In total, nearly 3,000 amendments were put up in this place to overcome deficiencies in the legislation that would otherwise have gone through, creating tremendous problems in the business community and for individuals in terms of interfering with their rights and benefits. There is no doubt at all that Mr Keating is, as was said in an interjection from our side a few minutes ago, flying a flag. I do not doubt for one minute that if he had his way we would have another referendum to try to abolish the Senate. But there is no way that he would ever get that through. We have him attempting to dump the Queen, the flag, the Senate and free speech. Anything at all that interferes with his power in the House of Representatives he opposes very strongly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the urgency motion before us. In doing so I wish to comment briefly on what Senator McMullan said when trying to trivialise this motion. It is worth noting who put this matter on the public agenda. It was this country's Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the same man who put the republican debate on the agenda and the same man who chose, overseas, to put the flag debate on the agenda. In fact, Senator McMullan was criticising his own Prime Minister, because we are debating this matter in this place today because of what the Prime Minister did at a school in this country. It is worth noting what the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> said. One could quote from a number of things but I will quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> because Senator Coulter referred to it. It said:</PARA></TALK.START>

This is not about good government for this country; it is not about good government for everyone in Australia; it is about his own little power base. That is why I rise to defend very strongly the Senate and what it stands for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to make particular reference to what Australia is about, because Australia is a federation of States. Let me say quite clearly that, if ever the Senate were abolished, I would be leading the charge for Western Australia to secede. Not only would I lead that charge to secede, but also it would in fact secede, because there would be no point in being subject to a dictatorial parliament in this country. I suggest that we would probably see Senator McKiernan, who is sitting on the other side of the chamber, alongside us in that charge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth looking at the figures in order to understand the reasons why we would secede. We should look at what Western Australia contributes&mdash;and the Senate provides us some protection in that regard in terms of the policy making process. Western Australia produces 100 per cent of the liquefied natural gas&mdash;not to be confused with liquefied petroleum gas&mdash;produced in Australia. It produces 97 per cent of the iron ore and 84 per cent of the lupins. One can go down the list of natural resources. Western Australia is the leader in terms of this nation's exports. We are one of the smaller States in terms of population but the largest in terms of production, and it is this Senate that gives us protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at some of the legislation that has been before this Senate. Previous speakers have already mentioned some examples. The sales tax Bills are not yet through. The Government slammed that legislation through the House of Representatives but has been forced to deal with 48 amendments. We can look at one of the pieces of legislation that I dealt with when I first came to this place&mdash;the legislation in respect of the wool industry. The Government was forced from its position of 15 per cent to 12 per cent. In fact, we on this side of the chamber were right; it should have been 10 per cent as that was all that was required. Let us look at the contractors legislation. The Government was hell-bent on unionising contractors. Because of the activities of the Senate it was forced to remove that part from the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate, through the Committee system, gives people the opportunity to put their point of view and have it dealt with. Senate standing committees and the Friday legislation committees review legislation, and that is a very important component of the legislative process in this country. We have very important issues to deal with in this country. In the last unemployment figures the unemployment rate in Western Australia went up another 0.7 per cent to 11.5 per cent. One would have thought that when Mr Keating went to this particular school he would have talked to the children about how he as Prime Minister was going to do something about getting them jobs. But he took off on a diversion; he stepped sideways. He does not have the ability, any more than the Government as a whole does, to address the key issues that bedevil the Government. </PARA>

I got up to about page 140 and my getting that far before I threw it away just shows how simple and how slow I was. I got up to the section which said that the Senate is a State's house. </PARA>

The reason for that was that it provided a consolation prize for people like me who could not win seats in the House of Representatives.

This is all set out in much greater detail in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of Thursday, 10 September in a letter from one Gordon Brysland, whom I do not know, but who is apparently a lawyer employed in the firm of Phillips Fox in Perth.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New Zealanders have been across here recently looking at introducing a Senate into New Zealand for the simple reason that it provides better government. Why does it provide better government? The manner in which legislation is guillotined, gagged, or whatever term one likes to use, through the lower House, has to be explained in terms of the way government works. There is a misconception abroad that those people who are members of the party which is elected with a majority of members are all part of the government. That is wrong. The only people who form part of the government are those people who are sworn in as members of the Executive Council. The other members of the political party who are of the same persuasion as those people so sworn in are merely there to give the numbers. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot fail to remember that the Constitution designed the Senate to be a House of greater power than any ordinary second chamber.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate was constituted as it is, after long fighting, prolonged discussions, many compromises, and many concessions on the part of the various shades of political thought throughout the Commonwealth, and it stands there in the Constitution in a position that has no equal in any Legislature throughout the world.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Bishop has just made some points about that. It is quite interesting to listen to Labor Party senators arguing the points and trying to support the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) when he cannot be supported for the remarks that he made. The ALP platform in 1984 mentioned review of the Constitution to ensure that the Senate did not have the power to reject, defer or otherwise block money Bills. It also wanted reform and eventual abolition of the upper Houses in the State parliaments but did not go so far as to suggest that the Senate ought to go at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1991, at the ALP conference, the platform seems to have done away with the objective of abolishing State upper Houses and refers only in the briefest way to the function of the Senate, suggesting that the lower House should be able to govern unobstructed by the House of review, as it refers to the Senate. God love us! What sort of country would we have if that had been allowed to happen?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us think of some of the things that this Senate has done in the recent past. The Australia Card legislation was flawed and it was discovered only through the work of the Senate. The superannuation legislation was flawed and was amended in the Senate. Sales tax amendments were pushed through the House of Representatives and while in the Senate committee the Government realised the flaws in that legislation. The Senate has blocked Labor Government legislation that would have affected the honey industry, the dairy industry, the prawn industry and the fishing industry, and it has been able to avoid the deeming of assets as income for country people. It has been able to quarantine the family home and the family farm from the capital gains tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us give a bit of credit to the committee system. The Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills and the Selection of Bills Committee do not exist in the House of Representatives. I have had the honour of being Deputy Chairman of the Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. The number of times we have found flaws in the Bills and have referred the matter back to the Minister are innumerable. These committees have been consistently responsible for amending flawed legislation, that is, legislation that is legally incompetent, not just legislation that does not have the support of the Opposition parties. Without the Senate, flawed legislation would become law and would need to be redrafted and reintroduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Look what happened the other day when we had another shambles caused by the Government pushing something through in the other place. It is this chamber in which the Government departments are brought to account. I believe Senator Bishop does that very ably in scrutinising the expenditure of government departments. Without the Senate we would not be able to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that Mr Keating's efforts would be better served by focusing on achieving the objective of fixing up the economy of this country, fixing things that need fixing, rather than trying to get a red herring across this landscape by trying to get rid of the Senate. The throw-away remarks which the Prime Minister made to school kids, or to any people in the community, does him little credit. One only has to watch him at Question Time and the way he handles that. He has no regard for the parliamentary process.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. It is evident that there has been a dramatic need to correct legislation that is gagged and rushed through the House of Representatives with no debate. If it were not for this chamber, those corrections to legislation would not have been made. As it is, enough legislation goes through, over our dead bodies, to cause the Australian people enough problems. Some of it is even so bad that it is thrown out by the High Court, despite our endeavours.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one wanted to get rid of any sort of restraints or constraints on the exercise of power&mdash;in other words, if one were Mr Keating, the Prime Minister, and one did not like the fact that one's whims, one's decisions, were not automatically rushed through the Parliament without debate, without proper scrutiny&mdash;then naturally one would want to get rid of the Senate; if one were that sort of person. So we have an attack on the Senate. We have had an attack on the Crown which provides a structure, which imposes some constraints on government. We get the continual attack on the States which are another power centre which are out of Mr Keating's hands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whenever we see people who are obsessed with power, we will see people who wish to destroy those instruments which separate them from the full exercise of that power. The Senate stands in the way of a man who wants to exercise power. That man is the present Prime Minister of Australia whose obsession with power is self-evident when we watch him, when we look at him, when we see what he has been doing. As a result, it is inevitable that the Senate should stand in his way. It is essential for democracy that it continue to stand in his way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on this urgency motion&mdash;what can only be called a bizarre motion. In the past week, with the issues of trade and tariffs confronting Australia, what have been the attempts of the Opposition to raise the big issues in this place? Senator Boswell wants to drape the Senate chamber in Australian flags. As I said in that debate, he wants a bunting-led recovery; he wants flags draped all over the place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite all the debate in the community, again today we get a debate about tariffs and about trade. We get the best we can get from the people opposite&mdash;a motion moved by Senator Hill condemning the remarks of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) regarding the role of the Senate. As my colleague Senator Walsh said, the remarks of Mr Keating were informal and obviously facetious, but there is more than a grain of truth in them. He said, `In reality, it's a (political) Party House'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not a States House. It has never been a States House. Ever since it was formed just after Federation, people have been voting in here according to their party tickets. It has always been thus and it always will be. Senator Bronwyn Bishop does not vote for what is best for New South Wales. She votes the way the Liberal Party caucus tells her in the party room to vote. That is her role; it is my role; it is the role of everybody here. That ought to be recognised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Remarks have been made about Mr Keating's concern about power. What has Dr Hewson said on a number of occasions over the last 12 months about the Senate? He has said that if a coalition is elected at the next election and it does not have a majority in the Senate and the Senate thwarts the introduction of Fightback and the GST, he will call a double dissolution. He is already indicating that he is frustrated with the Senate as it is presently structured. He will go to a double dissolution if the coalition wins the next election. Six or twelve months later what will we have? London Bridge to two bob the coalition will be back in here with a minority party holding the balance of power because of the proportional representation system of voting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Dr Hewson wants is almost impossible even in a double dissolution. Under the present political support in this community about 10 per cent of the public will always vote for a third or fourth party. They will ensure that this Senate will stop the Liberal Party from introducing large sections of Fightback and GST. Then we will hear the screams from those on the other side. The bagging they already give the Democrats for not voting with them on every occasion will continue. They will be bagging and crying about the powers of the Senate thwarting the mandate they have from the House of Representatives if they win the next election. So do not come in here and spill crocodile tears about the powers of the Senate, the balance of power and reducing the power. When those opposite were in government, especially when they had a majority in this place between 1975 and 1977, they used their numbers consistently to vote the Opposition down because they could put anything through they liked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had evidence in here before in debates about the guillotine; where the toecutter, Reg Withers, used to move that 20 Bills go through in an hour. That was when those opposite had the numbers. When they had the numbers outright they used it to make a mockery of the Senate as a house of review. Senator Walters, who was part of those gag motions, should not come in here and talk about the House of review representing the small State of Tasmania. You have never voted for Tasmania. You have always voted for the Liberal Party because its members select you into this place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have had remarks in here relating to other countries and their looking at introducing a Senate. Canada has been mentioned. Canada has an appointed upper House at the moment and it is looking at a way to overcome its problems and the difficulties between the French-speaking Quebec province and the rest of the English-speaking part of Canada by establishing some sort of elected upper House.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had representatives of the New Zealand Parliament in the chamber last week. What a great day it was to observe the Senate in full flight. I certainly know that the Labor members of that group went back saying, `We would really have to be stupid to take this on in New Zealand to move away from the unitary system'. The National Party in New Zealand is delighted to have a one-chamber parliament so that it can put through all the measures on industrial relations, to wipe out all the industrial relations regulations. The Opposition will not get that through the Senate because a compromise will be reached. Those opposite will be screaming and shouting about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had mention of South Africa as a possibility for an upper House.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find the list of the Liberal party spokespeople remarkable. This year is the fiftieth anniversary of the movie <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Casablanca</EMPHASIS>. One of the great lines in Casablanca involves the police commissioner, who is rather corrupt. To deflect attention from his activities, when some crime takes place he issues the immortal phrase, `Round up the usual suspects'. One can see what Senator Hill and the Liberal Party did for this debate. They rounded up the usual suspects who would scream and shout about Senate powers&mdash;the Senator Walterses, the Cranes, the Kemps, the Bishops, the Brownhills and the Baumes&mdash;the usual list of suspects who stand in this place and rant and rave about the powers of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe at all in the Senate having the power to overthrow the popularly elected House of Representatives. I do believe that the only justification for a House of review is to review legislation, but if the lower House insists on that legislation being carried, it should be carried. Here we have had people defending the Senate as an end in itself. That is not democracy. I think a lot of people in this place justify the Senate and its associated paraphernalia as an end in itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People ought to remember that the Senate operates in the way it does because of a quirk of the counting system that was introduced in 1948. As Senator Walsh says, if Mr Calwell, the Minister who introduced it, had realised he would be inflicting on the two major parties, the Labor Party and the Liberal Party, a Senate voting system which ensured practically for all time that a minority, a third or a fourth party, would have the balance of power, he would not have done it. So the only reason the Senate has any standing in exercising power is a fluke of the proportional representation system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If those opposite happen to be fortunate enough&mdash;I hope they are not&mdash;to win the next election or some subsequent election, they will be screaming in here about how a balance of power in the Senate has stopped the introduction of their Fightback and their GST. Then we will see what those opposite think of the Senate powers. Then they will be taking a different view. Certainly Dr Hewson has already indicated that he does not like the Senate having the power to thwart his GST or his Fightback policy. I am interested that people like Senator Bishop and Senator Walters, who are great devotees of the Fightback and the GST, do not recognise that at least Dr Hewson is honest in suggesting that he is going to take the Senate on and he disagrees with the Senate having the power to stop the implementation of his radical policy to introduce a Fightback and a GST. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, I foreshadowed during the short intervention that I made in the urgency debate that I would deal with some of the remarks that were made by Senator Walsh, en passant as they seemed to me, concerning the behaviour of the Australian Taxation Office and the comments that were made by Mr Boucher in his opening statement on the first day of the hearing conducted by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would remind the Senate and place on the record, so that we are not confused by Senator Walsh's comments, that I was making the point that the Tax Office has enormous might and power. I have said that the Tax Office and the Taxation Commissioner have the power to make grown men cringe. If anyone takes a look at the correspondence that I have received since this matter was aired they would see that there are thousands of ordinary Australians who have felt that might upon their heads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has been arguing that the Senate is a place in which ordinary Australians can get their voices heard. I now cite the Tax Office inquiry as a relevant case. Senator Walsh misrepresented my position in that he did not explain the points that I thought I had made succinctly. I had made the point that when we are dealing with an office such as the Australian Taxation Office we may examine only what is on the public record. Section 16 of the taxation legislation precludes, at least at first blush, the Australian Taxation Office from giving details of any particular tax pay out. Therefore, I said that we may examine what is on the public record. We find on the public record a letter dated 3 November 1986 written by Mr Cortese, the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation, to the Hon. P.J. Keating at his home address, in a very friendly fashion&mdash;</PARA>

I believe that Senator Bishop may be going into a realm of debate on this very sensitive issue, which is, of course, a matter of concern to many senators. She has championed a certain point of view.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy President. As I have said, I dealt with what was on the public record. What was on the public record was a letter to Mr Keating from the Australian Taxation Office. It was a personal letter to Mr Keating because it was sent to his home address. The letter stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dear Mr Keating,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this letter is to draw your attention to the need for you to file your 1986 tax return which is now outstanding.</PARA>
<PARA>The letter pointed out that his 1985 tax return was also outstanding. I compared that with a question that I asked in Estimates committees as to how many ordinary Australians&mdash;that is, not the boss of the Tax Office&mdash;were in fact prosecuted for exactly the same thing. The Tax Office itself answered me. It told me that there were nearly 10,800 ordinary Australians who got no such kindly letter but simply a summons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, I have received much correspondence from ordinary Australians who highlight the unfairness and injustice in the way they have been treated. I compared this to the way in which Mr Smiles had been treated. I drew attention to the fact that Mr Smiles' case involved an apportionment fight. During Estimates hearings I again asked the Tax Office how many matters had been pursued under the Crimes Act as distinct from the Taxation Administration Act on a matter of apportionment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason that the prosecution has been brought under section 7A of the Crimes Act was outlined to me in a letter from the DPP, which I have tabled in this place before. I did that because the DPP, together with the ATO, has chosen to deal with certain negotiations between those people and Mr Smiles in a particular way. I am merely saying that, on the public record, they have chosen to deal with Mr Keating in a particularly favourite way. A favouritism has been given out to the man who was the boss of the Taxation Commission.</PARA>

Earlier on I used the term `desk audits'. Mr Boucher very cleverly used a very technical definition to answer my questions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say that Senator Walsh has misrepresented my position for the following reason: I have highlighted these questions because I say that the Australian people cannot and will not respect the Tax Office and the people who administer it unless justice is not only done but is seen to be done. The evidence that I have before me is legion to show that that is not the case. </PARA>

She will be aware that there is a clause that says `but such matters may not be debated'. That means that she cannot in fact debate the issue with Senator Walsh or anyone else in this chamber.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Olive</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing in response to the final report on the implementation of pharmacy restructuring measures, handed down on 7 May 1992 by the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I note that the final report focused on the administrative aspects of pharmacy restructuring rather than broader policy issues that arose during the course of the inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Administrative and Legislative Framework</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate Standing Committee found the legislation for pharmacy restructuring unnecessarily complex and identified problems with the initial administrative processes to implement the restructuring.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends the consolidation of legislation and subordinate legislation for pharmacy restructuring and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. This idea is a positive one which would streamline the legislation. I will ensure the suggestions made by the Committee are taken into account in the context of the review of major portfolio legislation which was announced in this year's Budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I advised in the Government's response to your interim report, administrative procedures to implement restructuring measures, considered by the Committee, have been addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government recognises that some pharmacists may maximise their financial gain by using two interrelated guidelines under the Agreement. This practice is difficult to prevent as the two guidelines are pivotal to restructuring. A small number of pharmacists are able to take advantage of an unusual and fortuitous situation with pharmacy location, where they can claim a closure package on one pharmacy and subsequently relocate another pharmacy they already own which is within 500 metres of the closure site to that site.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Administrative measures to implement pharmacy restructuring were, in the first instance, undertaken on the basis of my press release. The Government acknowledges that there were problems with the introduction of these administrative reforms but, given the need to implement the decision with respect to the new approved criteria quickly to prevent speculation amongst pharmacists and entrepreneurs, the use of press releases to implement the changes were necessary in this instance. There was no intention to either advantage or disadvantage pharmacists through the implementation of the new arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, I would note that, except in circumstances when a very rapid response makes it impossible, it remains a major objective of the Government to implement all national programs by means of an effective and appropriately organised strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Implementation of Pharmacy Restructuring</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In accordance with the sub-section 98BAA(1) of the Act, the Government acted appropriately by negotiating with the Pharmacy Guild of Australia. With well over 90% of the owners of community pharmacy in Australia represented by the Pharmacy Guild, it is the most appropriate body to represent pharmacists in negotiations over restructuring of community pharmacy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The more specialised pharmacists' organisations referred to in the Committee's report, such as the Extended Hours Pharmacy Association and the Isolated and Essential Pharmacy Association are generally members of the Guild. As such, they were aware of and are represented in the Government/Guild Agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the early stages of restructuring, there was a settling in period as the Health Insurance Commission and the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority's duties were defined and clarified. This may have resulted in some administrative duplication. However, the few cases in which duplication occurred have been addressed during the course of your review. Administrative procedures have been streamlined.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nevertheless, both the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority and the Health Insurance Commission have roles in the administration of the arrangements. To avoid the potential for duplication in the future, the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services will continue to provide a secretariat service to assist the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority in its day-to-day functions and to undertake liaison with the Health Insurance Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following these initial administrative difficulties, the Government believes all officers involved in administering the legislation are adequately familiar with the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Evaluation of Pharmacy Restructuring Measures</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recognition of the importance of evaluation, the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority undertook a survey of industry in late 1991. Submissions on the effects of restructuring were invited, and those received from various pharmacy bodies showed a favourable attitude to the initial phase of restructuring. As a result of this favourable response, it was not considered necessary to undertake any major reforms at that time. Departmental evaluation of the processes of restructuring is ongoing with the continued assistance of pharmacy bodies. The Government is also about to undertake a computer analysis, using geodemographic modelling, on the impact of restructuring.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Lack of Appeals Mechanisms</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority was set up, no internal appeal mechanism was developed as it was envisaged that usual appeal mechanisms would operate including:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">&mdash;appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">&mdash;review of decisions by the Federal Court of Australia;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">&mdash;complaints to the Commonwealth Ombudsman; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">&mdash;complaints to the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These appeal mechanisms were found not to apply as a result of an appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Administrative Appeals Tribunal ruled that, although it had jurisdiction under section 105 AB of the Act to review a decision of a Secretary of the Department, it had no greater power than the Secretary. Since the Secretary could not grant an approval in the absence of a favourable recommendation by the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal could not do so either.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The absence of these normal appeal mechanisms was not intended.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following this decision, the Government moved immediately to amend the National Health Act 1953 to allow aggrieved applicants access to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The amended legislation was granted Royal Assent on 24 December 1991 and was made retrospective to the date the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority commenced operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By late January 1992 all aggrieved applicants were advised in writing of the changes. They were also advised of their right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and of the right to obtain a statement of reasons for the rejection of their application from the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More than forty applicants notified of the amended legislation exercised their right to obtain a statement of reasons from the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority and a significant number sought an Administrative Appeals Tribunal review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Remedy for misleading advice</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any pharmacist who can establish that he/she has been financially disadvantaged through being given wrong advice by Commonwealth Officers has remedies at common law which have been available since 1981 and has also had a possible remedy under the Audit Act 1901 since 1979.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These remedies are:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">1.Following the High Court decision in L. Shaddock &amp; Associates v. Council of the City of Parramatta (1981) 150 CLR 225, a Court can award damages if it finds that a public servant or other person acting on behalf of the Commonwealth has given advice negligently and the claimant has relied on that advice to their detriment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">2.Where it is apparent that a claimant is likely to succeed against the Commonwealth, in a claim for damages arising from misleading advice, the matter can be settled without being determined by a Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">3.Section 34A of the Audit Act 1901 enables the Minister for Finance to authorise the payment of moneys to a claimant where the Commonwealth is under a moral, as distinct from a legal, obligation to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Duplication of remedies which have been available for many years and which are directly applicable to the situations envisaged by the Committee is unnecessary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government also notes that complaints that certain pharmacists may have received incorrect advice have not been substantiated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conclusion, I would like to reiterate that pharmacy restructuring will achieve savings to the taxpayer and encourage a competitive, streamlined pharmaceutical industry. The initial administrative problems experienced with the introduction of pharmacy restructuring have been resolved and evaluation processes are in place to monitor the restructuring process. In addition, any significant policy issues which the committee identified in the inquiry have been promptly addressed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I read with some concern the Government's response to the final report of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs on the implementation of the pharmaceutical restructuring measures. The response I am talking about is dated 11 September, which does differ somewhat from the document provided to the Committee on 10 August. There have been some changes in the Government's response over that month and, while these do show a more positive attitude than the first response, I believe that the Government has still not appreciated the extent of the problems caused by the pharmacy restructuring measures which it began to implement in 1990.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleagues will remember that the objective of the pharmaceutical restructuring program was to rationalise the number and distribution of retail pharmacies throughout Australia. In its early stages the program was characterised by a lack of proper legislative basis, poor communications between the parties involved and confusion among public servants and the pharmacies alike. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Evidence before the Committee indicated clearly that the program had a number of loopholes. On the one hand, these led to rorts by some pharmacists who either obtained new approvals to dispense pharmaceutical drugs through questionable eligibility, or obtained closures or amalgamation payments in excess of those that they should have received. On the other hand, misleading and incomplete information left some pharmacists in a disadvantaged position. Although the Government addressed some of these problems prior to the Committee's final report to the Senate, its response to the final report falls short of expectations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that one of the changes that the Government now appears willing to accept is the Committee's recommendation that legislation be consolidated. I also note that there is now a greater willingness to accept that there were indeed problems inherent in using press releases as the basis for extensive action without the provision of standard guidelines. I welcome these changes. However, I note the explanation given by the Minister that there was a need for a press release in order to prevent speculation amongst pharmacists and entrepreneurs, which I consider to be simply an evasion of the issue. Discussions were being held for a considerable period before the press release of 24 July and 8 August 1990, so many pharmacists and others were well aware that changes were coming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It remains my belief that the failure to provide a sound administrative framework for the changes led to chaos, and certainly did not result in there being no speculation. The variable meaning of the word `commitment' in the Minister's press release resulted in some extraordinary decisions being taken, which is hardly conducive to establishing a solid basis for a major restructuring. The Minister suggests that the continued respective roles of the Health Insurance Commission and the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority will be safeguarded from duplication by the provision of a secretarial service by the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services. This is no guarantee at all. In fact, since the status quo is being preserved in all aspects of the restructuring program, we must expect to see a continuing absence of clear definitions, continuing blurring of the areas of responsibility and a growing number of disadvantaged and confused pharmacists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister goes on to say that the Government believes all officers involved in administering the legislation are adequately familiar with it. I would like to believe that, but I have yet to be convinced. With regard to evaluation, one of the major concerns of the Committee was that there was a limited relationship between the supposed objectives of restructuring and the means of achieving them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Minister's response of 11 September, we were advised that departmental evaluation of the process of restructuring is ongoing with the continued assistance of pharmacy bodies and that a major reform of the process was not considered necessary in late 1991. I am afraid I find this response totally unsatisfactory, as I do the promise that there will be some future computer analysis using geodemographic modelling. Surely it should have been the Department's responsibility to establish this before restructuring got under way. Is it that the Department and the PRA simply do not know what the current situation is? Why has no clear statement been issued on what has been achieved so far? Is not this response the place to state clearly that restructuring is working because there has been an appropriate and expected shift in the distribution of pharmacies, that the process has been cost effective and that the community can look forward to much more efficient and economical provision of this valued service? As this has not been said, as we have no real evaluation, I believe we still have some serious problems with the achievement of the objectives of restructuring. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE REPORTS OF THE SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ANIMAL WELFARE ON TRANSPORTATION OF LIVESTOCK WITHIN AUSTRALIA, ASPECTS OF ANIMAL WELFARE IN THE RACING INDUSTRY, AND EQUINE WELFARE IN COMPETITIVE EVENTS OTHER THAN RACING</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final three reports of the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare were tabled on 3 September 1991. The reports were entitled Transport of Livestock Within Australia, Aspects of Animal Welfare in the Racing Industry and Equine Welfare in Competitive Events Other Than Racing. The Government is now in a position to respond to the reports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reports on racing and other equine events are directed primarily towards State and Territory Governments and the controlling bodies of the sports concerned. With the exception of the Equestrian Federation of Australia, these bodies are not funded by the Commonwealth Government. The Government's role in the response to those two reports will therefore be primarily a coordinating and monitoring one, through the Sport and Recreation Ministers' Council. The National Consultative Committee on Animal Welfare (NCCAW) will also be providing advice to the Government through the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, on the implementation of measures proposed by the Senate Select Committee and on any outstanding issues of animal welfare concern. The Government has brought to the attention of the Equestrian Federation of Australia those aspects of the Committee's conclusions which are within the Federation's influence. The Government will continue to contribute to equine welfare through funding sources conducted by the Australian Coaching Council, which address issues such as equine conditioning, nutrition, injury prevention, work stress and recovery. Consideration is also being given to the establishment of an Australian Horse Industry Council in order to facilitate research and development in the horse industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report on livestock transport contains twenty recommendations, several of which are directed specifically to Commonwealth Ministers, their Departments or Councils which play a significant coordinating role between Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments. These recommendations will be addressed in detail in this response.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Legislative control of animal welfare and transport within Australia is primarily the responsibility of State and Territory Governments; the Commonwealth's involvement is limited to a coordinating role. Animal welfare legislation and codes of practice are administered by the Government of the States or Territories through which the stock travel and may vary considerably from one part of Australia to another. Model codes of practice for animal welfare are developed by the Sub-Committee on Animal Welfare (SCAW) of the Standing Committee on Agriculture. Once endorsed by the Australian Agricultural Council (AAC), these codes serve as the basis for the States and Territories to develop their own codes. The Model Codes are revised every few years to take account of advances in scientific knowledge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a need for uniformity in the States and Territories with regard to the transportation of livestock. The regulation and control of livestock transport is complex and, even within one State, involve at least two Government departments and several other interested parties. Furthermore, one truckload of animals can fall within several State or Territory jurisdictions during the course of one journey. This has two consequences. Livestock transporters can be fined in one State for what is quite legal in another&mdash;for example, volumetric loading is legal only in Queensland, and carriage of horses in double deck vehicles is illegal only in New South Wales. Secondly, it becomes more difficult to undertake a successful prosecution for cruelty to animals during an interstate journey unless it can be proven that the cruelty occurred in the State or Territory under the legislation of which the action is being taken.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been an overall increase in the distances stock are being transported for slaughter, resulting from economic rationalisation of the slaughter industry, and this increases the need to address livestock transport from a national perspective so as to minimise welfare problems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth Department of Transport and Communications plays an important coordinating role in promoting a national perspective on road transport policies through the adoption of uniform practices. The Department's objective is to improve the operating environment of the road transport industry and reduce regulatory impediments to interstate trade. The National Road Transport Commission (NRTC) will play an important role in developing a national perspective on road transport, including the transport of livestock. The NRTC is an independent statutory authority established under Commonwealth legislation. Its role is to develop national technical and operating standards for heavy vehicle registration, regulations and charging arrangements. The regulations will include design and construction requirements, vehicle road worthiness and inspection standards, traffic codes, driver licensing standards and procedures, special codes of practice, enforcement levels and penalties for breaches. Regulations will apply nationally unless the NRTC considers there are compelling reasons to allow regional variation. The NRTC will also oversee the implementation and enforcement of those technical and operating standards by State and Territory administrations. The proposed establishment of a consultative committee on transport will ensure that the needs of both industry and government bodies are taken into consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AAC, known from February 1992 as the Agricultural Council of Australia and New Zealand (ACANZ), will also play a major role in national coordination of livestock transport policy. The Sub-Committee on Animal Welfare (SCAW) has expertise in this area from an animal production perspective and is presently revising the model codes of practice for road and rail transport of livestock into a National Model Code of Practice for Land Transport of Livestock. The AAC considered the Senate Select Committee's recommendations at its February 1992 meeting and has referred them to SCAW for detailed consideration with a view to implementation by the States and Territories. The National Consultative Committee on Animal Welfare (NCCAW) has also made recommendations to the Government on how the welfare of animals during transport can be improved and its recommendations have been referred to State and Territory Ministers for consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am now in a position to respond to the recommendations made in the Senate Select Committee Report on the Transportation of Livestock.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 1: That the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and the Minister for Transport and Communications assess current mechanisms for national co-ordination of animal welfare and transport matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government agrees that a national perspective is required on road transport policies, with the adoption, as far as possible, of uniform practices in the States and Territories. The Agricultural Council of Australia and New Zealand (ACANZ) (formerly the Australian Agricultural Council) and the National Road Transport Commission (NRTC) will play a major role in the national co-ordination of animal welfare and transport matters. Establishment of a common national livestock transport advisory committee will facilitate coordination between the two portfolios.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 2: that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and the Minister for Transport and Communications establish a national livestock transport consultative committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At its February 1992 meeting, the Australian Agricultural Council considered this recommendation and agreed that the Sub-Committee on Animal Welfare (SCAW) should form the core of a Consultative Committee on Land Transport of Livestock. Council considered that in addition to State and Territory Departments of Agriculture, already represented on SCAW, the Consultative Committee should include representatives of the Australian Livestock Transporters' Association, the Australian Veterinary Association, RSPCA, the National Farmers Federation, the National Road Transport Commission (NRTC) and the State and Territory Departments responsible for transport. The establishment of this Consultative Committee will be implemented by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and Minister for Transport and Communications.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 3: that the Department of Primary Industries and Energy ensure that the Model Codes of Practice on Animal Welfare and, in particular, the Code on the Road Transport of Livestock are published in a more compact, durable and professional format.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 4: that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, in conjunction with other members of the Australian Agricultural Council ensure that these Codes are distributed to all relevant parties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported in principle.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government agrees that the national Model Codes of Practice should be published in a compact, durable and professional format, and should be available to all relevant parties but considers that industry organisations must share the responsibility for making their members aware of, and encouraging them to comply with, the Codes. Several Model Codes of Practice have already been published by CSIRO as part of the SCA Technical Report Series and are available from CSIRO at $10 per copy. It is intended that the new Codes and those currently under revision, including the transport codes, will be published in the same format. The Government acknowledges that the cost may be a disincentive and the Sub-Committee on Animal Welfare is currently addressing the need to achieve wider dissemination and greater awareness of the codes in conjunction with State and Territory Governments, statutory authorities and industry organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 5: that all State and Territory Governments adopt the Model Codes of Practice and, in particular, the Code on Road Transport of Livestock and give them recognition by regulation under relevant legislation relating to the prevention of cruelty to animals. The Committee further recommends that the codes be disallowable instruments and that breaches of the codes, although not actionable as such, may be used as evidence in support of prosecutions under provision of the principal legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported in principle.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The availability and status of the Model Codes of Practice is an issue which was addressed by the Senate Select Committee both in this report and the report on the Culling of Large Feral Animals in the Northern Territory and which is being given continuing consideration by Governments. There is a diversity of views among State and Territory Governments, industry bodies and animal welfare organisations regarding the status of Codes of Practice, some considering they should have legislative backing while others believe their value is greatest if they are regarded simply as guidelines as is the case in most instances. There is also a divergence of view as to whether the codes should reflect average farming practice or the leading edge of good animal welfare practice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government considers that this lack of agreement on the role of the codes is limiting their effectiveness and needs to be resolved, particularly in the case of Codes on transport. The Government's view is that the Model Codes endorsed by AAC should have the status of guidelines to industry on good animal welfare practice, based on the best available scientific information, and that measures which are necessary to prevent serious animal welfare problems should be incorporated into the State and Territory legislation rather than into Codes of Practice. The need to make Codes of Practice more readily available to, and accepted by, the relevant industries is recognised by both Governments and industry and is being addressed through SCAW.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 6: that all State and Territory Governments ensure that authorities enforcing legislation relating to prevention of cruelty to animals being transported be given sufficient powers and resources to perform these tasks.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported in principle.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government considers that measures need to be implemented to protect the welfare of horses and other animals during transport. However, it is not convinced that there is sufficient evidence of welfare problems arising from the use of double-deck vehicles per se to warrant their being banned at this time. The greatest opportunity for improving the welfare of horses during transport may lie in other measures such as selection of horses of suitable height for the crates to be used, and careful handling and driving. Research in Queensland has demonstrated that horses can be carried safely in double-decker transport, provided there is sufficient head clearance to allow them to stand comfortably and that they are drafted on height before transport; however, opinion is still divided on whether these criteria are likely to be met in practice. The Government concurs with the view of the Bureau of Rural Resources Report entitled "The Welfare of Horses Being Transported" which concludes that further research is needed into the welfare implications of horses travelling long distances with their heads close to wither height before a conclusive statement can be made on the humaneness of double-deck transport for horses. The Government urges the Northern Territory and those States from which horses are sourced for slaughter to undertake such research as a matter of priority and for all States and Territories to develop a consistent regulatory approach based on the outcome. The Consultative Committee on Land Transport of Livestock will be asked to consider this issue.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government agrees that a set of national design rules appropriate for the registration of vehicles licensed to carry livestock could be a positive step in a welfare sense and has referred this recommendation to the relevant Ministerial Councils. The Consultative Committee on Land Transport of Livestock would be a suitable body to carry out this task.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A distinction needs to be made between "optimum density loading" and "volumetric loading" as the latter term is widely used to describe the system which operates in Queensland, under which trucks loaded to optimum density are exempt from compliance with weight limits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Livestock producers and transporters strongly support volume loading on the grounds of both animal welfare and productivity considerations. The Australian Livestock Transporters Association is in favour of volume loading.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The overriding concern of the Department of Transport and Communications in the movement of livestock is that any initiatives are implemented on a national basis. Whether or not optimum density or volume loading is adopted on a uniform and reciprocal basis is a matter for the States and Territories to resolve. If a decision is made to introduce optimum density or volume loading, the Department would support the establishment of a consistent national regulatory framework to improve the operating environment of the livestock industry and minimise regulatory impediments to interstate trade.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Volume loading has not been adopted outside Queensland because of a lack of general agreement between the State and Territory Governments due to concerns about greater road damage and safety. The National Road Transport Commission is currently preparing a discussion paper on national arrangements for moving specific commodities which will encompass volume loading of livestock.</PARA>

Arrangements are still in place for a drover to be accommodated free of charge on trains conveying livestock, subject to prior application by the consignor. The AN also recently sought the views of the companies and associations with a major role in the transport of cattle on the Alice Springs line.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Chairman of the Animal Welfare Committee, I welcome the Government's response to the reports on transport of livestock in Australia, aspects of welfare in the racing industry and equine welfare in competitive events other than racing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to refer briefly today to three matters raised in the response to the Committee's report on transport of livestock. Firstly, the response recognises, as did the Committee's report, that legislative control of animal welfare and transport within Australia is primarily the responsibility of State and Territory governments and that the Commonwealth's involvement is limited to a coordinating role. As legislative controls and codes of practice may vary considerably from one part of Australia to another, the need for a consistent and coordinated approach becomes obvious. For example, during the course of one journey, a truckload of animals can come within the jurisdictions of several States or Territories and hence a livestock transporter can be fined in one State for what is legal in another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I welcome the Government's initiative, in response to the Committee's recommendation, to establish a National Livestock Transport Consultative Committee. This Committee will include representatives of the Australian Livestock Transporters Association, the RSPCA, the National Farmers Federation and the National Road Transport Commission&mdash;all organisations which are involved with these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I note the statement that the Government is not convinced that there is sufficient evidence to prohibit the transport of horses in double-decked vehicles. In this regard, I draw the Senate's attention to the fact that, in 1987, the New South Wales Parliament prohibited the transport of horses in these vehicles after a series of incidents involving several injuries to horses carried in double-deckers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I bring to the attention of the Senate some of the remarks that were made in New South Wales at that time. The State Government argued in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Horses on the lower deck [of a double-decked trailer] are unable to adopt a normal head carriage. Horses are forced to hold their heads at or below the level of their withers [shoulders]. This necessitates extension of the dorsal muscles (stretching of the top muscles of the neck) for prolonged periods in the case of long distance transport. An opinion on the effects of this type of head carriage was sought from Dr Rex Butterfield, former Professor of Veterinary Anatomy at Sydney University and President of the Australian Equine Research Foundation. Dr Butterfield said this position would cause great discomfort to horses forced to maintain it for extended periods. He added that it would also make it difficult for a horse to maintain equilibrium when the natural tendency when unbalanced is to elevate the head.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Severe head injuries, including skull fractures, eye injuries and deep lacerations, are frequently sustained by horses travelling on the top decks of trucks&mdash;due to the horses being hit by overhanging branches, etc.</PARA>
<PARA>This was the basis for the outlawing of the carriage of those animals on double-decker trucks. I find it very difficult to understand the sort of advice that might have led the Minister to make the comments he did about not being convinced of the sufficiency of the evidence. For instance, paragraph 2.5 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The position adopted by the New South Wales Government is also supported by animal welfare organisations. RSPCA Australia's policy statement maintains that the Society "will only accept the transport of horses in single deck vehicles especially designed for the needs of the species carried". Similarly, ANZFAS opposes the use of double-decked vehicles for horses.</PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 2.6 states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Representatives of other organisations appearing before the Committee were opposed to the use of double deckers for horses. These included Mr Michael Clark, of the Australian Council of Livestock Agents and Dr Lex Carroll and Mrs Ruth Wade, speaking on behalf of the Cattlemen's Union.</PARA>
<PARA>That is by no means an exhaustive list of the people who oppose this practice. During the Committee's investigations I did not talk, either privately or officially, to anyone who did not agree that such a practice should be outlawed. Therefore, I again suggest to the Government, through the Minister, that it take whatever action is possible, and not give succour to those State governments which appear to say, through pressure from whatever lobby, that this practice should not be outlawed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government, in its response to this report, has basically opted out of making any recommendations about the reports on racing or competitive equestrian sports. I find it a little incongruous that the Government can say on the one hand that it has no involvement with these sports while on the other hand suggesting that a National Consultative Committee on Animal Welfare will provide advice to the Government on the recommendations. One minute it is saying that it wants to opt out and the next it is saying that it wants to opt in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the enormous success of the very much underfunded equestrian team in the recent Olympics&mdash;the team of Matt Ryan from Singleton, Andrew Hoy from Culcairn, Gillian Rolton from South Australia, and David Green, who is now resident in England but previously a Queenslander&mdash;one would hope that in future the Federal Government takes a more active interest in this equestrian sport as well as others. If our team members can be successful&mdash;as they were with almost nothing from the Federal Government&mdash;imagine how much better they might have been with some assistance for coaching and other financial help that it has given to other sports such as swimming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the Government's response to the report of the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare on the transport of livestock within Australia. I believe the report was a credible document. The report involved considerable research on behalf of the Committee and its secretariat, and a large number of honourable senators were involved during the Committee's existence. I am pleased that many of our recommendations have been supported. I say to Senator Burns that I believe it shows the worth of the Senate&mdash;the Senate that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) wants to get rid of. But I am disappointed that other recommendations use the hackneyed phrase `supported in principle'. That is too often akin to doing nothing or duckshoving to yet another committee, subcommittee or department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendations 1 and 2 highlight the need for a national approach to transport. In a country such as Australia, I believe it is absurd that we have different rules for different States, given that a truck can drive through three or four States in 24 hours. It is obvious that only a national approach to transport will be effective and efficient and in the best interests of the animals involved. I am concerned that at the Federal level we have various committees dealing with animal welfare. We have SCAW, the Subcommittee on Animal Welfare, the National Consultative Committee on Animal Welfare and now subcommittees of these to review various legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report back process under this regime has a tendency to get bogged down. I hope this will not be the case with the recommendations from our report that have been referred to these committees. Our recommendations, such as codes of practice, may well get lost in the toing and froing, and it might be another decade or so before the drivers who transport livestock become aware of such codes. We found in the inquiry that, too often, drivers and transport companies were unaware that such codes existed. I hope that the new revised codes are better circulated and publicised in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that distribution of the new codes, which was recommendation 4, is only supported in principle; in other words, it is not our job. If everyone says that, there is no point in writing them. Recommendations 5 and 6 on the uniformity of animal welfare legislation have once again been referred through the Agricultural Council to the various States and Territories. Although it is a matter for the State Governments&mdash;rodeos have been banned in the ACT, even though they are not held here&mdash;this ad hoc approach to animal welfare laws should obviously stop as soon as possible. Constant reminders through the Agricultural Council might be the only way, but it definitely needs to be repeated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The response to recommendation 7 is probably the most disappointing of all. Our Committee called for all State and Territory governments to prohibit the transport of horses in double-decker vehicles, which the Chairman of the Committee, Senator Burns, made reference to a little while ago. The response is, in my view, a total cop-out by the Government. There was an abundance of evidence to prove that transport of horses in this manner is inhumane. Offhand, about the only submission to favour such a move was the Queensland Department of Agriculture, which obviously had considerable pressure from long-haul transport drivers and maybe horse meat processors. Of course it is cheaper to use one truck rather than two to transport 60 head of horses, but to take animals from Queensland through to Peterborough in South Australia by this method is barbaric in this latter half of the twentieth century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope the new Consultative Committee on Land Transport of Livestock acts quickly to ensure a uniform ruling on this issue. I believe that anyone who is interested in horses&mdash;especially horses that have been friends of the people who have been riding them&mdash;would believe that the practice of horses being sent away to spend the end of their days in such an inhumane way should stop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope also that this committee looks favourably and acts quickly on national design rules for vehicles. We need minimum standards before we can start to achieve uniformity of legislation. The Government response to recommendation 12 on further examination on optimum density loading comparative to volumetric loading is neither a yes nor a no. It merely states, `The issue is contentious'. That is precisely why the Committee suggested that further research on this was needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other recommendations involving training programs for drivers are also supported. I hope that the major driving and other relevant industry organisations have already started to work towards this. They said during our inquiry that they were. Personal experience has shown me that there is a wide divergence in the skills and the expertise of drivers employed by transport companies. In the inquiry on which we have embarked into the feedlot industry, it was quite interesting to hear that the industry is making sure that the drivers who bring their stock in and take their stock away are their accredited drivers. It is so important that the animals are handled in the correct manner due to problems of bruising and stress, and other bad handling methods which make for bad-eating meat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that, for their own part, transport companies have little to go on when hiring drivers other than the experience the driver says he has. If there were accredited driver training schools, at least prospective employees could demonstrate some expertise in this area. I think that would be a step in the right direction. I am pleased that the Government has finally responded to these reports, even if it has taken some 13 months to do so. </PARA>

As a member of the Committee, I share with the Chairman and the Deputy Chairman of the Committee their disappointment to some extent that the Government has chosen to express its response with words such as `supported in principle' and has not given sufficient detail to how this principle will be either enacted or enforced in sufficient circumstances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> On the first page of the Government's response, at the end of the paragraph under point 2, mention is made that consideration is being given to the establishment of an Australian horse industry council in order to facilitate research and development in the horse industry. It sounds quite a good sentiment to express but gives us no indication of either a timetable or a method by which such a council can be established. As I have said, it does not indicate when it will be established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similar sorts of wordage are contained throughout this response and I think that is the reason for the Chairman and the Deputy Chairman expressing some degree of frustration with it. Although it seems to be a response which takes into account the concerns that the Committee found through examining numerous witnesses and travelling extensively on the inquiry, the response lacks a definite approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are told that legislative control of animal welfare and transport within Australia is primarily the responsibility of the State and Territory governments, and I can certainly forgive the Commonwealth Government for making that observation. We are told that the Commonwealth's involvement is limited to a coordinating role. What the four parties that were represented on the Committee unanimously found&mdash;and this was strongly supported by all witnesses who came before it&mdash;was the need for somebody to take the lead and to do a little bit more than coordinating by showing that leadership. Suggestions were made about the areas in which leadership was required urgently. The coordination was going along fine, but without leadership the coordination was not producing the results that were necessary in this particular area of animal welfare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all very well for the Government response to include a list of what legislation and codes of practices are administered by the governments of the States and Territories and to illustrate lack of agreement by those States so that a transporter could traverse several areas of jurisdiction in carting animals from one part of the country to the other. That is hardly a revelation; Australians have been observing that for almost 200 years. This is a big country involving many different sets of circumstances. What we need is some leadership in pulling these documents together and making them logical and relevant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Parts of the response do not merit cynicism. I congratulate the Government on them. In response to recommendation 2 the Government proposes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and the Minister for Transport and Communications establish a livestock transport consultative committee.</PARA>
<PARA>In short, the Government's response is to say that the establishment of this consultative committee will be implemented by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and the Minister for Transport and Communications. That is certainly welcome, but again I observe in passing that there is no indication of a timetable, so perhaps it is a hollow promise; I have no reason to think it is anything else. </PARA>

<PARA>That is something that I agree with. It is all very well to require the Government to print these in a cheap and available format and recommend that they be adopted, but there is a dual responsibility, and I must agree with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not take too much of the Senate's time by reading each of the recommendations and drawing a conclusion which is shared by most of the members on the Committee.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Committee was unanimous in its recommendations;  there is not a minority report.

<PARA>I know that I can speak on behalf of other members of the Committee when I say that our Committee heard sufficient evidence to know what effect that would have and also to make the recommendation, as we did in recommendation 7, without any qualification.

<PARA>Although that sounds as if we might be getting somewhere, we are caught up in wordage. It `will facilitate resolution'; it will not require resolution. I am afraid that what the industry requires is the resolution of this longstanding issue. It may be facilitated, but I am afraid that is about as weak as most of the responses that we have before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 16 recommends that all drivers of vehicles carrying livestock as part of a commercial transport enterprise should be properly trained and possess a suitably endorsed vehicle driving licence, et cetera. We are told that that is supported in principle. Then we are given the revelation that the issue of driving licences is a State and Territory function but qualifications are a National Road Transport Commission function, and any proposals to include additional information on the licence would require the agreement of all States and Territories. We know this; it is not news. We are asking for leadership, and perhaps heading towards the implementation of relevant and necessary accreditation of people who have been trained in the transportation of livestock. I am disappointed that what we are told in response is a bunch of truisms rather than some enlightenment that we can follow or leadership which is worth while. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Deputy Chairman of this Committee, Senator Brownhill, mentioned, a couple of years after hearing evidence on this particular subject, the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs is hearing evidence from those who are involved with the feedlot industry. We are hearing evidence from the operators of cattle feedlots that training in and proper execution of their duties by those involved in transporting cattle is crucial to the profitability of the industry. It is a matter which is treated so seriously by the operators that we were told in evidence that operators employ their own regular drivers and are very reluctant to consider employing somebody who is not known to them or recommended strongly by somebody who knows what requirements there are in the moving of livestock. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with Senator Calvert; provided that train No. 7166 arrives at Dry Creek at 10 a.m. on Sunday, everything will be hunky-dory. This all sounds very well. Several witnesses addressed themselves to the problems of rail transport. Page 59 of the report, which honourable senators may care to refer to, states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Peter Barnard, Director of Transport of the National Farmers' Federation, referred to the results of a study on bruising and other indicators of animal welfare incurred during various modes of transport. The study concluded that "rail came out worst".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was suggested to the Committee that rail's poor record in running to schedule, owing to both delayed departures and unplanned stops, exacerbates animal welfare problems. For example, Dr Plant, a member of the Australian Veterinary Association, commented on "sheep leaving Broken Hill, where they had to be loaded at a certain time in the morning but probably did not leave until the afternoon".</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Wirth and others added to that evidence. The point of my raising that now is to suggest that the good intentions of Australian National Railways, in suggesting that everything would be fine provided that train No. 7166 arrived at Dry Creek at 10 a.m. on Sunday, may be all very well, but in practice we have evidence that such schedules can go wrong. The whole matter requires a little more than the assurance that it is possible to fix it. In this response we are looking for something more than what amounts to a response of words rather than action. It may read very well, but I would have preferred to see a timetable of action and assurances that were couched in legislative terms rather than promises. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to follow on from where Senator Bell left off on the Government's response to the reports of the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare. I wholeheartedly agree with the point he made that in some ways it responds to some things and leaves a lot out. It has been very detailed in its response to the matters that the Commonwealth sees as its own, and that is mainly related to the transport of livestock. It is what it does not say that I believe is the most disappointing part of this response.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government has done the usual trick of most Federal governments over the years: when they see something that is the responsibility of the States, or that they think is the responsibility of the States, they handball it off to the States and it goes back to where it started from. It is most disappointing, as a member of the now disbanded Animal Welfare Committee, to see the amount of work that was put in by not only ourselves but also those people who made submissions and all those well-intentioned people who put forward their views and tried in their own way to improve what has been rather contentious. I am referring mainly to the racing industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a disappointment, considering the amount of time we spent on the report and the publicity we received. Some of the publicity was not all that positive&mdash;when we attended the Melbourne Cup, for instance&mdash;and I can understand the criticism. When one looks at our report, one sees it is only so thick, and it is a disappointment that of even those recommendations the Government is saying, `It is really not our business; it goes back to the States'.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The racing industry is a very important industry. It has an annual turnover of more than $250 billion a year. It employs 250,000 people. The best we can come up with is a report only so thick because we did not have the time, the resources, the know-how and the willpower to finish it because it was too hard. By the same token, in response to that report, the Government is saying, `It's a matter for the States'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are serious about things such as the use of the whip and all the animal welfare issues that were raised, including the racing of two-year-olds, harness racing and greyhound racing, I am sure we should have built on the evidence we received and made the report a more comprehensive document. The sporting people involved in the racing clubs were looking for something better. They did not get it. The response they got from the Government was even worse. It has gone back to the States where it will stay and nothing will happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Something positive did come out of this report, believe it or not. When we were taking evidence on the sulky design and harness racing, Mr Bede Ireland, one of the people who submitted evidence, put forward a very strong case for changing the sulky design because of the accidents that had been happening in harness racing in Australia. We gave a platform to those people who were concerned about the design of sulkies to put forward their views. We did not make a recommendation&mdash;another thing about which we were not positive enough in our report. We did not pursue the matter because we ran out of time, but at least we raised the issue, the issue has been debated and I believe in recent days statements have been made and action will be taken about changing the design of sulkies, which could be of some assistance to the safety of our racing industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area that we covered, which again was not examined in the Government's response, is equine welfare in competitive events other than racing&mdash;and here I refer to rodeos. As rodeos are seen as a State issue, there was virtually no response from the Commonwealth Government. But I notice there has been a response from the Labor controlled ACT Government. It is in the process of&mdash;if it has not already&mdash;banning rodeos, along with performing live animals in circuses. This is the same Government that has allowed abortion clinics to open up and, in recent days, has decriminalised drug taking in the form of marijuana. The ACT has always been the centre in Australia for obtaining pornographic movies. The ACT Government does not have enough money to support decent health care for aged people in the Australian Capital Territory, but it certainly knows how to ban rodeos and how to stop people from enjoying good, wholesome family fun at a traditional circus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is disappointing to see that the Government has not responded to the issue of rodeos. They are part of our culture, particularly in the northern parts of Australia where the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins), who is at the table, comes from. Rodeos are held in his area and I do not think the governments there have any great problems with them. Most of the RSPCA bodies keep an eye on those things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the issue of the transport of live animals. In Queensland there is optimum loading; in other areas it is called volume loading. As far as I am concerned, it is commonsense loading. If someone has a truck and puts as many animals on that truck as is reasonable, without causing too much discomfort to the animals, not only is the situation being avoided where those animals may be bruised and trampled on and welfare matters may arise but also the amount of money people pay for freight is minimised. It seems that optimum loading is allowed in only one State at this point in time because of the load weight limitations in other areas in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Government supports the recommendations for a national set of standards for the loading of livestock. It also supports in principle the recommendation that drivers of vehicles carrying livestock be properly licensed and have the proper qualifications to cart livestock and&mdash;a very important area&mdash;that owners provide train drivers or clearers for the stock that spend so much time on rail transport. The sooner those recommendations are put into place the better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All in all, it is good to see that the Government is supporting some of the recommendations. I hope it supports them through to fruition. I guess support in principle is okay but, as I said at the start of my speech tonight, someone has to pick up the recommendations of the racing industry report and the equine welfare report. In the endurance riding area, a significant number of horses are being killed from overriding. That came through to us loud and clear. It is important that we have a decent report as soon as possible on the problems in the multi-billion dollar racing industry. As soon as we have that, it is to be hoped that the Commonwealth Government&mdash;whichever agency it may be&mdash;will come up with some national principles and national rules. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This document indicates that some 42 million people around the world may be in need of assistance. This is more than double the entire population of Australia. The problem is massive; there is no question about that. Incidentally, the document that I incorporated was one which came from a conference held in Sydney earlier in the year called `Welcome Stranger'. It was convened by the Australian Catholic Bishops Committee for Migrant Affairs and the Australian Council of Churches Refugee and Migrant Services. To deal with this growing problem, Australia and other major countries of resettlement such as the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom have been reviewing and amending their refugee laws and processing arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Joint Standing Committee's inquiry has been an important part of that review process. With countries around the world looking to each other for solutions to their own refugee difficulties, the Committee report takes on a significant international dimension. The recommendations in this report will be compared with and assessed against the proposals which other countries are bringing to the refugee debate. In the report, the Committee has sought to achieve a balance between the best humanitarian outcome for asylum seekers while ensuring that Australia maintains control over its refugee programs and systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the inquiry, the Committee had to come to terms with a number of changes to Australia's on-shore refugee and humanitarian system implemented by the Government. Through these changes, the Government has sought to address the deficiencies in the existing processing arrangements. Most of the evidence to the inquiry supported the establishment of a simpler and speedier processing system for on-shore asylum seekers. There was a strong view that lengthy delays in processing not only disadvantage genuine refugees by the prolonged uncertainty in their lives, but also provide an incentive for those who do not have legitimate refugee claims to lodge an asylum application as a mechanism for prolonging their stay in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this report, the Committee has noted the recent changes which have been implemented and announced in relation to both the primary refugee decision making process and the review procedures. At the primary stage, the changes include priority processing of border claimants and detained illegal entrants, time limits on the lodgement of applications and greater emphasis on case officers obtaining information at interview. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the review stage, the changes include the recently announced replacement of the Refugee Status Review Committee with a new and independent Refugee Review Tribunal in 1993. The Committee anticipates that the RRT will be demonstrably fairer, should allow for more accurate assessment of the merits of a claim and should be faster and less costly. The Committee, though, was concerned to ensure that there would be consistency in decision making between the various members appointed to the Tribunal. For this reason, it has recommended the appointment of a senior member to the RRT who would be responsible for allocating work to Tribunal members, ensuring development and enhancement of country expertise and who would be empowered to establish three-member Tribunal panels to consider model case types for persuasive authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the inquiry, one notable criticism of the existing decision making process was that information available to the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs regarding events and circumstances in particular countries was incomplete and out of date. The Department itself admitted in evidence to the Committee that the data available to it is limited as its documentation centre is still in the formative stages. To rectify this problem, the Committee has made a series of recommendations aimed at improving the information which is available to both the Department and the review body.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, the Committee has recommended that the Department establish and maintain a current and comprehensive database relating to every country in the existing refugee case load for use by departmental officers and the Refugee Review Tribunal. In addition, refugee applicants should be able to request and obtain all publicly available information which is used by the Department or the Tribunal in making its decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee also gave consideration to the existing procedures for granting entry on humanitarian grounds. In this report, the Committee has endorsed the principle of providing short term extensions of stay to particular ethnic or nationality groups in humanitarian need. Recent examples of this policy include the concessionary arrangements applied to the nationals of Kuwait and Iraq during the Gulf conflict and to nationals of the former Yugoslavia. The unique situation relating to students in Australia from the People's Republic of China is dealt with by way of a separate chapter in this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Committee's view, such a policy allows the Government to respond appropriately by providing protection to classes in need while ensuring that such protection is given for the term of the conflict or disaster which is the basis of the need and not beyond it. To this effect, the Committee has recommended that short term extensions of temporary stay not only should be given to individuals in a class or group affected by civil disorder, but also should be considered for individuals in groups whose homes or livelihoods have been affected by a major natural disaster. The areas affected by the civil disorder or natural disaster could be either a nation state or parts of a nation state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To ensure that the temporary extension of stay is given to those who actually need it, the Committee has recommended that where repeated extensions of stay in excess of one year have been given, before any further permit is granted the applicants should be expected to show not only that they are citizens of the country affected by the civil strife or natural disaster, but additionally that their homes, livelihood and families are in areas affected, or that they would be required to return to the area affected if returned home. The Committee was unanimous in support of this measure but unfortunately that consistency has not remained through the further deliberations of the Committee and its recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the general on-shore humanitarian program, the Committee considered the existing procedures for humanitarian entry, under which the refugee and humanitarian streams are combined into one process. The Committee was firmly of the view that the refugee and humanitarian streams should not be separated because of previous problems relating to duplicitous applications. However, it has recommended that to assist future decision making in this regard, monitoring of the existing refugee case load is required to determine which cases are more appropriately humanitarian claims than refugee claims. The Committee has also recommended that the new Refugee Review Tribunal be empowered to recommend to the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs that, in deserving cases which do not meet the requirements for grant of refugee status, the Minister grants stay on humanitarian grounds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the more contentious issues during the inquiry related to Australia's procedures for processing people who claim asylum at Australia's borders. This includes boat arrivals who, under existing requirements, are held in detention until their applications for asylum are processed. In particular, the Committee heard some criticism about the lengthy detention to which recent boat arrivals have been subjected. In a number of cases, persons have been held in detention for over two years. Various explanations were given to the Committee for this lengthy detention, particularly of the Cambodian boat arrivals. While some have criticised the processing procedures of the Department, others have been critical of the time taken by lawyers to lodge refugee applications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been particularly concerned about some of the public comment on this issue. It has been argued that undocumented arrivals should be released into the Australian community because they have been detained for so long.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is conveniently overlooked that some of the delays in the processing of applications were in part caused by the withdrawal of applications lodged on an individual basis. The withdrawal was requested by refugee support groups who delayed the re-lodgment of the applications and now conveniently blame the authorities for the delays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee is firmly of the view that, regardless of where the blame should be apportioned, the detention of those boat arrivals has lasted far too long. It is imperative that the procedures which are in place do not allow a repetition of such lengthy detention. In this regard, the Committee has noted the recent initiatives of the Government which are aimed at achieving a more efficient and expeditious determination system for border claimants, including the adoption of processing target dates. The Committee has also noted the amendments to the Migration Act in May this year, which set out the intentions of the Parliament that undocumented boat arrivals should be held in detention until their status is determined, but that such detention should not extend beyond a designated time frame. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for existing detention arrangements, the Committee has recommended that, given the new expeditious processing procedure for border claimants, the Government retain the policy of holding border claimants in detention until such time as their applications can be processed. Priority, though, must continue to be directed to the expeditious processing of border claimants, with adequate resources to be directed to the Department to ensure that processing targets are met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has also recommended that the detention facility at Port Hedland be maintained. While the Committee heard various criticisms about the Port Hedland facility, particularly about its remote location, the Committee found that the facility had proved useful in ensuring improved access to detainees and improved opportunities for obtaining information relevant to their claims. In particular, the Committee took note of evidence from one group of lawyers working at Port Hedland that the location of the facility enables those lawyers who are assisting border claimants to focus on the task of preparing applicants' claims without the usual daily distractions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that the Committee did not, as a committee, visit the Port Hedland facility probably detracts from the report. Had we done so, we would have been in a better position to refute some of the more outrageous claims that have been made about the facility. The Deputy Chairman, the honourable member for Dundas, and I found during some in camera hearings that we were advantaged by the fact that we had some understanding of conditions at Port Hedland because we had seen them first hand. I hasten to add that Mr Ruddock was in Port Hedland at a different time to myself. Our first-hand information enabled each of us to ask incisive questions of witnesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the next meeting of the Committee, I shall be moving that the transcripts of in camera proceedings of the Committee be published with the appropriate deletion of names. I give notice of this action, because I feel inhibited by the in camera proceedings to refer to that evidence in public at this time. However, I do feel that the Government and, indeed, the taxpayers of Australia, should have the opportunity to see how some publicly funded bodies argue their case before parliamentary committees. The Government and the taxpayers should be able to judge whether they are getting value for money. Indeed, the refugee applicants, the asylum seekers, should be able to judge this as well. I suggest that some asylum seekers would be more than a little disappointed in their advocates, based on the evidence presented to the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the role of lawyers in the refugee processing system, the Committee has recommended that public funding be available for the provision of legal assistance to border claimants in relation to the preparation of primary applications for refugee status. However, the Committee felt that public funding should not be available for pursuing unmeritorious claims through every avenue of appeal. Accordingly, it has recommended that publicly funded legal assistance to refugee claimants seeking review of a refusal decision be provided via the Legal Aid Commission, based on the merits of the particular case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this time I will move away from my prepared notes to say that, on reading the final document, I now have some concerns about the words that we have used in our final recommendation. If we had put in something about making application to legal aid commissions in the various States, it might have better and more appropriately reflected the views of the Committee and certainly my own personal views. I am aware that many legal aid commissions throughout the nation are strapped for cash because some of the State Governments are not fulfilling the obligations that they have in the past agreed to. I will draw that point to the attention of the Minister in due course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee also considered the issue of permanent residence for refugee applicants. In the past, Australia granted successful refugee applicants immediate resident status. However, this policy was modified in June 1990, when new regulations were introduced which gave refugees a four-year temporary stay with the option of obtaining permanent residence at the end of the four years, subject to availability of places in the migration program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While endorsing the general principle of granting a four-year temporary stay to refugees, the Committee was concerned about the inflexibility of this arrangement. In the Committee's view, there are a few refugees, notably torture and trauma victims, who ought not to be required to wait out their full four-year temporary permit time if places in the refugee program are immediately available or become available at some earlier time within the four years. Recommendations to this effect are contained in the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final chapter of the report discusses the contentious issue of asylum seekers from the People's Republic of China. This issue was the subject of much debate during the inquiry and within the Committee itself. In particular, considerable attention was focused on the position of PRC nationals who had arrived in Australia prior to the incident in Tiananmen Square in June 1989, and the Government's decision to grant such persons four-year temporary entry permits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Debate within the Committee was directed especially to the undertaking given by the then Prime Minister that no PRC national in Australia before 20 June 1989 would be forced to return to China against his or her will. This undertaking was reaffirmed in April 1992 by the current Prime Minister. The Committee concluded that while recent policy in relation to PRC students&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Committee considered that there were difficulties in granting permanent residence to pre-Tiananmen Chinese as a class. It also considered that there are problems if all such PRC citizens are rejected for permanent residence when their temporary entry permits expire in June 1994. Such a move would raise the alarming possibility of the refugee determination system being clogged with some 10,000 PRC citizens when their temporary entry permits expire in June 1994.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In searching for a solution to this problem, the Committee came to a consensus agreement that Australia, as a nation, must stand by the word of its Prime Minister and should honour the spirit of the commitment which was made to those PRC nationals. However, there was disagreement in the Committee as to what constitutes a solution to the PRC dilemma within the spirit of the Prime Minister's commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this question, the Chairman of the Committee chose to follow his own point of view which differed from that of the majority of the Committee. The Committee recommended that the Government should end the uncertainty concerning the long term future of PRC permit holders in Australia by announcing the arrangements which will be used to differentiate between those who, from June 1994, will be granted permanent residence; those who may be granted a further four-year temporary entry permit; and those who will be returned to the People's Republic of China. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has recommended that, from June 1994, PRC permit holders should be able to apply either for permanent residence on the basis of already existing criteria for change of status&mdash;like everybody else&mdash;or for continued protection on a case-by-case basis against internationally accepted refugee criteria. The Committee has recommended that those who do not meet the selection criteria should be granted on expiry of their permits a short extension of stay&mdash;say, three months&mdash;to put their affairs in order and make appropriate arrangements for departing Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key words in the Committee's recommendation No. 28 are `non-discriminatory criteria' and `principle'. Little emphasis was placed upon those words when the report was tabled in the other place. In fact, the Chairman very carefully omitted reference to the words in his tabling speech. This is surprising when considering the importance of the meaning of these words and particularly the meaning and effect of the words in the context of the recommendation and the report as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee, in saying that the Government should not treat PRC nationals any differently than any other national group, is saying that there should be no distinction, no favour for or against, no prejudice against or for, PRC permit holders. The Committee is quite properly reflecting in this recommendation the evidence that was given to the Committee during the inquiry. `Principle', according to the Macquarie dictionary, means, among other things, `a fundamental, primary, or general truth, on which other truths depend'. In addressing the dilemma of the PRC temporary permit holders in Australia, the Government should be non-discriminatory, principled and consistent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, commenting on the cost of processing onshore applications as opposed to the cost of processing refugees from overseas, I quote from the speech given by the Secretary of the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs Mr Chris Conybeare, to the conference I mentioned earlier, the Welcome Stranger conference, which was convened by the Australian Catholic Bishops Committee for Migrant Affairs and the Australian Council of Churches Refugee and Migrant Services. Mr Conybeare said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The difference in cost between on-shore and off-shore processing of refugee cases is staggering. The Government has allocated $42 million for 1992/93 for processing of on-shore asylum claimants. On current processing and approval rates up to 1500 people will be approved for refugee status on-shore next year. This represents a cost to the Australian tax-payer of $28,000 just to process each successful on-shore refugee. This is over 100 times the cost of processing a successful refugee applicant overseas&mdash;processing of Australia's planned off-shore component for 1992/93 is expected to cost just over $2 million.</PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that that figure is outrageous. I suggest also, as I did some three weeks ago at the close of business on the Thursday night, that it is offensive to Australian taxpayers and the Australian Government, when some PRC nationals have gone through the process of making claims, lodging appeals and then being granted refugee status, that those people should then come out publicly and bag the Government which is granting them refuge. I suggest that these words be taken into account by all future successful refugee applicants and that they, in their public announcements following the success of their claims, be very guarded in their comments because the words of those last six who visited this chamber did not help the situation of refugee claimants in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The political news from this important parliamentary report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's Refugee and Humanitarian System: Achieving a Balance Between Refuge and Control</EMPHASIS> of the Joint Committee on Migration Regulations is that a majority of Government members and all Opposition members call for an end to the discriminatory refugee policy which was announced by the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, with regard to China. This majority have called for a non-discriminatory refugee and humanitarian policy whereby persons applying for refugee status in Australia, from whatever part of the world they come, will be treated alike. I welcome that emphasis in the important, indeed major, parliamentary report that is before us today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the three honourable senators who serve on the Migration Regulations Joint Committee are Senator Cooney, Senator Lewis and Senator McKiernan. I note that two of those honourable senators are absent from the chamber today on parliamentary business, so it is following Senator McKiernan that I make these few remarks as a coalition senator. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I very much welcome the particular remarks of Senator McKiernan that have differentiated his tabling speech from that of the Chairman of the Committee, Dr Theophanous, in his reported remarks in the House of Representatives today. I do not agree with the minority report of Dr Theophanous. For that matter, whilst I recognise the conscientiousness of the minority report of my other colleague and good friend Senator Cooney, I do not favour that either. I would want to look with some scrutiny at the majority report, and certainly I prefer it to the two minority reports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that there are two Government members of Parliament on this important Committee who have conscientiously disagreed with three of their colleagues and have joined with the four coalition members of the Committee is something of political note. I regard the conclusions set out in the minority reports, somewhat similar between Senator Cooney and Dr Theophanous, as a softer option, as an overemphasis on compassion and as not getting the balance right between Australia's ability and justice in making available refuge and the issue of control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to differentiate three periods in Australia's immigration experience with regard to refugees: firstly, prior to 1975; secondly, a transition period between 1975 and 1989; and, thirdly, the more difficult years since 1989. Most of us are familiar with the great contributions made to Australia by refugees from Europe following the Second World War, particularly east Europeans dislodged from their countries by the communist menace and those of the Jewish community in Europe who had been persecuted by the nazi war machine in Germany. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are in all of our cities Australians from all of the Eastern European countries&mdash;indeed most countries of Europe&mdash;who we know have made positive contributions to this country. I am proud that Australia was a refuge for these people trying to find a stable and peaceful home, a place where they could constructively develop their own families. I do not wish to single out the Baltic communities, but I am very close to the Lithuanian, Estonian and Latvian communities and I recognise the enormously positive contribution they have made to this country through three generations now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the pattern of refugee immigration to this country that we were all brought up with. But then we have the Indo-China refugee situation, the so-called boat people, from 1975 until 1989. We are aware that over these years Australia gave as many as 22,000 refugee places a year, a higher number per capita than any country in the world&mdash;even exceeding that of the United States and Canada. In this period the intake was still somewhat limited to the people escaping, if you like, from Vietnam and Cambodia. The number was rather limited. At the same time, there were refugees in Australia from Central America, Chile and other parts of the world where there was totalitarian persecution and a denial of the freedoms and rights of people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After that experience we came to this much more difficult era that has been with us since 1989. Why do I pick 1989, and why does the Parliamentary Committee refer to this matter as a worldwide problem requiring a new sensitivity, as Senator McKiernan said in his speech just now, involving scores of millions of people in every part of the world right now? What are the concerns in respect of this new era of refugees in what we will call the new world order post-Cold War, post-Gulf war and following the collapse of communism in the Soviet Union? I think we are in a new era when we will not easily see the end of distressed refugees fleeing countries and even parts of countries. We see the problems in Africa&mdash;Somalia, Mozambique and many other parts of Africa&mdash;in Yugoslavia, still in Indo-China and also in many other parts of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Along with that we have seen particularly students but also others coming away from China following the massacre in Beijing and the breakdown of order in that city in June of 1989. Of course, the largest group concerning Australia in these last three years in terms of making applications for immigration on a humanitarian basis has been people from China. We were aware that at the time of the events in Tiananmen Square in Beijing there were 21,000 Chinese in this country, the majority of them students. They were, by a wave of the hand, given the ability to stay in this country by the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke. But it is not widely known that some 44,000&mdash;more than double the number here at the time&mdash;came from China to Australia under not very vigilant visa requirements, again mostly students. The great majority of those arrivals are still in Australia and still have undetermined status. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of them are illegal residents in this country. Many of them think they have been promised some continuation of temporary residence. Some of them think that they will never be forced to leave this country and return to their own country. Many of them believe that they will be successful in making applications based on humanitarian considerations. It is therefore highly appropriate that this important joint Committee of the Parliament consider all of those elements, including the international situation, the precise law and regulations in this country and our processes of making determinations. Therefore, in chapters 1, 2 and 3 we see the development of this report. In chapters 4 and 5 there is direct discussion in detail of law and practice concerning refugee status and humanitarian status, and in chapter 6 the determination process is examined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I really salute the members of the Committee. I note that Senator McKiernan is in the chamber. I mention also my colleague the Deputy Chairman of the Committee, Mr Philip Ruddock, whom I represent often in this chamber in handling immigration matters for the Opposition. I really respect the body of knowledge that they have developed and the conscientiousness and care with which they have gone about producing those chapters of the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was happy to serve on this Committee during its inaugural year and to sit with those colleagues, and also the Chairman, Dr Theophanous. I also note the expertise of the legal adviser, Dr Kathryn Cronin, and the staff of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though I have had only the day to read the report, and I have indicated that I much prefer the majority report to the minority reports, I believe that all of us should still read the report very carefully. I would not be surprised if the Government, when it responds to the report, was still not as inclined to move away from the control aspect as is suggested by even the majority report. I am very aware that Australia must look to its own national interest and must assure the Australian people that the immigration program is under control. The present Labor Government has been beset by confusion, indecision and delay in these matters, and, whilst this report goes a long way towards helping the Government out of those huge difficulties, I do not believe that it is necessarily getting the balance exactly right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I very much respect my four Opposition colleagues who have been right through this inquiry for two years, and I do not wish to express a disagreement with them and the majority of the Committee. But I want to say that I, and I believe other senators, feel that we should look away from the soft option side of some of the expressions in this report and ensure that the government of the day gives confidence to the Australian people that it is in control of our immigration program, including refugee and humanitarian determinations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by referring to chapter 8 and the recommendations therein concerning citizens of the People's Republic of China. I have not yet seen in the report any direct admission of the mixed motives of those who have applied on the basis of humanitarian and refugee considerations for permanent residence in this country. Amongst these mixed motives is widely acknowledged to be a straightforward love of Australia&mdash;an aspiration to find in this country a better lifestyle, greater affluence and a better life for the applicant's children by establishing families in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are all good aspirations and no doubt the great majority expressing those aspirations will be excellent citizens of this country. But I wish to see in the report&mdash;and I do not see it&mdash;an explicit recognition of these mixed motives in the persons who are applying. I talk of up to 40,000 applications with regard to these matters. I wish to come down in the same way as Senator McKiernan and my colleagues in the Opposition in this report by stressing that we should make sure we have an immigration program which is non-discriminatory and which is fair to all applicants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that there are millions of people around the world who would love to have a lifestyle such as is possible within Australia. They would love to see their children grow up in Australia and they would love to see the opportunities that Australia affords for them and their families. We must be fair in our immigration program choosing between applicants from all countries and not least applicants who would set out applications on the basis of refugee or humanitarian concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not time now to expand upon recommendations 27, 28, 29 and 30, which are certainly fair, stable and preferable to the minority reports, and certainly do come from the considerations set out in the body of the report, especially chapter 8. If I have differed, even with the majority, it is to ask questions only; to ask questions about whether the balance really has been right and how we can ensure that we restore confidence to all the Australian people&mdash;or at least the great majority of Australian people&mdash;by having a refugee and humanitarian determination process which inspires their confidence.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening we are continuing the second reading debate of the Sales Tax Assessment Bill 1992 and a package of related Bills. There is no better example available to the Senate or interested parties of the ineptitude of this Government than this particular package of Bills. It is not just that it is a package of Bills that displays some ineptitude; it is a package of Bills that goes to the very heart of what the next election in many respects is going to be about, that is, taxation reform.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is well-known that some time ago my Party said the wholesales sales tax system had to go. It was unreformable, unwieldy, unworkable, too complicated and nobody understood it, and that system and some other indirect taxes had to go and be replaced by a simple one-rate goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To that claim the Government said, `Do not be ridiculous; you are a hopeless lot of idiots and you do not know what you are doing. The wholesales sales tax system can, in fact, be reformed'. What we see in this package of Bills is the Government's attempt at reform. We all know that the issue of tax reform is really going to be one of the key issues at the next election; it is central to the outcome of the next election and which party will form government after that election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, we have a situation where my Party says, `This hopeless wholesale sales tax system cannot be reformed,' and where those opposite say, `Yes, it can'. The Government announced in the 1990-91 Budget that it would undertake a review aimed at simplifying the wholesale sales tax system. In short, the Government has messed it up and messed it up badly. Those opposite have had a long time from the 1990-91 Budget&mdash;the first Budget introduced by this Government after the last election&mdash;to do it and they have messed it up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government said, `One does not have to get rid of wholesale sales tax; one can so simplify it as to get rid of its problems'. This simplification process has proceeded in two steps. The first was the extension of wholesale sales tax exemptions available for business inputs which were announced in the 1991 economic statement. This package of legislation we are talking about tonight is the second and final step, as far as the Government is concerned, in fixing that wholesale sales tax system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This package was introduced into the House of Representatives on 26 May and agreed to by the House on 28 May. I am not sure, but I think it was debated under a guillotine. The package of six Bills certainly went very quickly through the House of Representatives without obvious adequate scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The package of six Bills replaces the current total of 27 wholesale sales tax Acts. One can turn to the Senate program of business to get the names of the Bills concerned. The primary substance of the changes to the sales tax system are included in the first two Bills; the other changes in the remaining Bills are much more mechanical. Prior to the legislation being debated here, Senator Short, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, supported by the Democrats quite wisely, successfully moved a motion to refer the legislation to a Senate select committee for examination. We had already heard concerns in the community about the way the Bills were drafted. These are the Bills that are the result of an extensive inquiry into how to simplify the sales tax system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee was established on 25 June and had as a reporting date 19 August. That was not a very long time. The Committee advertised for submissions and in spite of the very short time involved, 150 submissions were received from a very broad spectrum of business and community organisations. There were 150 groups or individuals that put in a view in that short space of time. I will not say pretty well all of them but by far the great majority said, `You have messed it up. You have not simplified this in the way you said you would'. There were some people saying that, from the taxpayers' point of view, it would be worse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Public hearing dates were set for this select committee. The Committee met on 12 August and 13 August. What did we find on the night of 11 August? We found the Treasurer issuing a short press release announcing that due to the continuing consultations that he had had&mdash;which is the nice way of saying, due to the fact that someone had tipped him to the fact that he had messed this up&mdash;he would now have to make amendments, drastic amendments, to fix up the mess he had made. Because the Government did not want to be as overtly honest as that, it said that due to the continuing consultations it now had to make some improvements. That is a euphemism for fixing up a botch. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This press release was issued the night before the Senate select committee was to meet. I have a deep suspicion that had Senator Walsh not been on that Committee and not looked through the submissions, toddled around to the Treasurer and said, `Listen buddy, I do not know whether you can read or not but you have messed this up badly', not much would have happened. We can at least be sure that if the Government had its way and the Bills passed in the original form they would have been very badly flawed Bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why did that not happen? The reason it did not happen is that the Bills had to come here. In the Senate there was a capacity to force the Government to wait for its Bills, to submit those Bills to further proper scrutiny and to allow the members of the community who were going to be affected by the Bills a better chance to have their say as to how the Bills in reality would affect them. It is because of that action that the Government had to announce its drastic backdown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To look at what the substance of the legislation is meant to be about, one goes to the ministerial second reading speech in the House of Representatives. One sees that in that speech the main features of the package are painted as being a significant reduction in the number of persons required to pay tax, a complete restructuring and redrafting of the wholesale sales tax system into plain English, a streamlining of the system for acquiring business inputs and other conditionally exempt goods free of tax, and a significant strengthening of the anti-avoidance provisions. That is what one would think it is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one reads those highlighted features, they would suggest that the simplification process was primarily concerned with the mechanics of the sales tax system rather than changes to the tax base or to the tax treatment of various goods and business operations. It is now apparent that this was not the case. The proposed legislation included clear policy changes, particularly related to the following areas: external costs, leases, goods donated to or used in repair or construction of buildings and so on owned by exempt bodies, coverage of tax rulings, businesses operating as deemed manufacturers and the treatment of untaxed goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation also had the effect of overturning a number of court decisions which had gone against the Taxation Office in recent years. That is more evidence again of a clear change of policy being painted as being mere simplification; it is getting through under the guise of being simplification. These proposed changes to the sales tax system understandably raised the ire of the business community and that resulted in this last minute backdown. It was a pretty pathetic effort; a press release issued the night before a Senate select committee was set to have public hearings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The backdown was on six key elements of this so-called simplification package. The elements are: the treatment of external costs, the application of the general anti-avoidance provision, exempt use leases, the untaxed goods provision and the deemed manufacturers provisions. It might be worth spending a bit of time to go through some of those to give an idea of just how badly the Government messed this up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us deal first with the external costs. As I understand it, the original legislation sought to bring into the sales tax base product design and development costs incurred by persons beyond the wholesale taxing point, that is, design costs incurred by a retailer who contracts out the manufacture of goods. It was particularly intended to catch large retailers who were involved in designing and developing their own brand products. What the select committee was told was what the public response was&mdash;that this provision would affect a much larger group than was its intention, bringing into the tax net things such as shop floor designs, promotional material and letterhead paper, the difficulties of isolating the design or development component of a good, and calculating a notional wholesale value to it. These elements were highlighted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The design industry was also vocal in arguing that the provision would strongly impede products innovation. The Government backdown in this respect is that it has said that it will not proceed with the external cost provisions at this time. Therefore, the design and development industry is not totally happy. `At this time' seems to imply that at another time if the Government can it will. Nonetheless, at least at this time that is not being proceeded with and the Government is going to be happy with toddling off to do some further examination of the issues raised by business&mdash;some further examination one could argue it should have done before it brought the Bills into this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I refer to the general anti-avoidance provision. The original proposal gave very wide scope to the Tax Commissioner to decide whether or not a taxpayer was involved in tax avoidance&mdash;it was a frighteningly wide power&mdash;and to cancel the identified tax benefit according to the Commissioner's own view of what otherwise might have occurred. Business argued very strongly that these powers were too wide, and that the provision was draconian and would threaten many legitimate commercial transactions and create considerable uncertainty in business dealings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government saw the writing on the wall and we had a back-down there too. The Government will now include a list of criteria in the general anti-avoidance provision which the Commissioner will have to consider in deciding whether or not to cancel a tax benefit. I understand that the Commissioner will need to determine that the overall dominant purpose of an arrangement is to gain a tax benefit before commencing proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to exempt use, the original legislation stated that for a good to be conditionally exempt, the immediate user had to qualify to receive the tax exemption regardless of the status of the final user. The public response to that was that community and business organisations expressed concern that this would result in tax on things such as construction and repairs carried out by contractors for exempt bodies such as charities and public instrumentalities, and goods donated to charities. It would be a disaster. The Government realised the stupidity of its course of action and backed down. The Bill will be amended to retain exemptions that would have been removed by the original proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, with leases, the original legislation would have removed tax exemptions for equipment leased by businesses for short periods. Business argued that this proposal would hamper efficient commercial practice and give a competitive advantage to firms that could afford to take on long term leases or buy equipment. I understand that the amendments will show that the Government now has to retain the current tax treatment of leases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could go on and deal with the untaxed goods provision and the deemed manufacturers provision, but the story is the same pretty well all along. We have a package of Bills that is meant to reflect a competent review of the wholesale sales tax system by a government that says it is competent, and in six major respects it mucked it up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might be worth while, Mr Deputy President, to raise with the chamber through you some of the things the Select Committee was told. Mr Firmstone, from the Institute of Chartered Accountants, who presumably knows something about these matters, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We doubt that&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the new system&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">will, in the ultimate, be easier for taxpayers to work with. It will be easier for tax consultants to work with, but the language of it and the sheer size of it is such that I do not think taxpayers are going to be any less daunted in their task of trying to deal with it, despite its re-expression and streamlining.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We think that on balance certainty has not been added to, it has been detracted from.</PARA>
<PARA>One of the key elements of any taxation reform is certainty. Mr Firmstone, representing the Institute of Chartered Accountants, said that on balance its view is that certainty has been detracted from, not added to. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A lot of the Bills before us. . . tend to confuse rather than simplify, and they appear to be adding restrictions to certain areas that were not there before.</PARA>
<PARA>That is certainly the view of the aviation industry. People have written to me in the last couple of days about extraordinary difficulties with the Tax Office in relation to some of those matters. I will not mention another quote that I was thinking of mentioning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is worth repeating the mess-up that this is, and exaggerating the degree to which it is a mess-up. I do not have the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> in front of me, but I see some of the officers who were at the hearing are assisting the Minister in the chamber. They will no doubt remember that there were occasions when questions were put by senators. None of us on the Select Committee, as I understand it, are accountants. I do not know about Senator Short; perhaps he has worked as an accountant. I think his degree is in economics. None us being accountants, we put pretty simple questions and were told by the Tax Office that they would have to be taken on notice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the answer to Senator Archer's question: what about simplification? There were numerous&mdash;and by `numerous' I do not mean to imply that there were 20; it was perhaps even less than a dozen&mdash;occasions when the Taxation officers assigned to assist the Senate Select Committee were asked questions about the so-called simplified package and they had to take them on notice. They did not know what the effect of this or that particular provision quite specifically would be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question is: if the Tax Office does not know at a Select Committee hearing, how can we possibly expect taxpayers to know? How can this Government continue to deny that the operation of this wholesale sales tax system, simplified or otherwise, is costing people in the business community a fortune because they have to pay to get advice as to how this matter works. They get themselves into quite serious trouble if they take a guess and get it wrong.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What that leads to is that this purported simplification should probably not be proceeded with. The Government should accept that the best thing to do with the wholesale sales tax system is simply to get rid of it. Lest the arguments as to why that should happen have fallen on deaf ears in the past, as I imagine they have, I will repeat them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we get rid of the wholesale sales tax system and shift to a goods and services tax, as proposed by the coalition, we will take the wholesale sales tax element in the cost of products out. We will stop that wholesale sales tax element, indirect or otherwise, cascading through the system, so that consumers pay when they buy, whether they are people who want to buy the goods to reuse them or people like you and I, Mr Acting Deputy President, who want to consume the product. This is often lost on people because when we buy something at the supermarket it does not have a big tag on it saying `wholesale sales tax'. That is one of Labor's biggest lies. Those in the Labor Party march around the country saying, `Members of the coalition hate low income earners, they have no compassion for them and they are going to put a tax on food and clothing. Isn't that shocking? We would never tax food and clothing'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at food. Let us take the example of Weetbix. The wheat has to come from somewhere and it has to go in something to get to the Weetbix factory. By and large, it goes in trucks that are pretty big&mdash;trucks that have a wholesale sales tax component on them of upwards of $25,000 on each truck. All these trucks are out there carting around all this stuff, whether it is wheat to the Weetbix factory or flour to some bakery. They go to all the factories that produce food that low income earners and high income earners buy and eat. All that stuff that gets from the producer to the factory goes in these trucks that have this wholesale sales tax component on them and their parts, and a fuel excise on the fuel that they use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be no surprise to anyone that the freight companies that carry the wheat, the flour and everything else to these food companies do not pay that out of the goodness of their hearts. They are not the Salvation Army and we do not expect them to pay them out of the goodness of their hearts. So what do they do? They pass it on. The freight man says, `I've had to pay this wholesale sales tax. This is my cost and I'm going to mark up my cost'. So he not only pays the tax, but he also puts a mark-up on it and passes it on to the poor old Weetbix factory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we toddle along to the Weetbix factory and we have a gander at what is happening in there. We find a whole lot of people who do not think they are paying payroll tax, because they are not; but someone is paying it on their salaries. It is being loaded onto the price of the Weetbix because the Weetbix manufacturer does not pay the payroll tax out of the goodness of his heart either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not only a case of payroll tax on the salaries of the people in the Weetbix factory plus these taxes involved in bringing all the gear there; wholesale sales tax is also on a whole range of things in the factory that are non-production related items&mdash;and that is not paid for out of the goodness of anyone's heart. What do the Weetbix people do when they have put all this stuff together, when they have paid all their taxes and the profit on it is charged by the freight forwarder?  They add up their costs and they add a bit more on to that. So the tax component not only has been put up by the freight man but also has now been put up by the Weetbix man. Surprise, surprise, it all goes into another set of trucks on which there is another lot of sales tax, with another lot of sales tax on the parts, and another lot of fuel excise. All this stuff is rolling around the country, cascading through the price of food. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We get to the wholesaler and what do we find again: more people with payroll tax on their salaries, more trucks going out, more bits and pieces in the wholesale warehouse that do not have an exemption from sales tax. What does the wholesaler do?  He does not run this service for nothing. He is not the Salvation Army. He calls in another set of trucks with wholesale sales tax on them and another load of people with payroll tax on their salaries and off it all goes to the supermarket. </PARA>

All of this is loaded into the price of Weetbix. Because the supermarket does not have a big sign on it saying, `Sucker, Food Tax Here', Labor pretends that it does not tax food. That is the biggest load of rubbish I have heard in my life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the moment the ingredients leave the farm, at every step along the way, taxes are added to the price of food.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The big Labor lie `They are going to tax food' tells the truth&mdash;yes, we are going to put a goods and services tax on just about everything&mdash;but not the whole truth. Those opposite are trying to pretend that they are the Salvation Army and that there are no taxes on food and clothing and that they are going to keep it that way. By pretending that, to the extent that they do say that individually, they will be liars because they will be telling the truth but not the whole truth. They will be deceiving the public because of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do we want to do? We want to get rid of this stupid system so that the sorts of business input taxes I have been referring to will be abolished. There will be a simple 15 per cent tax on the value added at the end. That will, of course, mean that a lot of prices of goods and some services will be reduced because we will be made more competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These arguments fall on the deaf ears of those on the other side of the chamber because they have locked themselves into rejecting Option C, which was the preference of the then Treasurer. It has been dumped now because we have opted for it and those opposite cannot afford to come too close to our position. They want to keep this existing wholesale sales tax system. They want to keep a system that has, as one of its smartest moves, things like taxing carbonated mineral water but not taxing flat mineral water. That is a really bright spark initiative. They want to tax goods but not services. Why should we continue to do that? Why should people who make things suffer some sort of an administrative burden when people who provide services do not? It is clearly ridiculous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We say this whole stupid system should go. We say not only that this system should go but also that a number of other taxes should go, some of which I have referred to, including fuel excise, payroll tax and a number of other taxes. We say it should go not just because it is stupid to have taxes cascading through the system from some academic point of view. It is stupid to have them doing that because it is costing us jobs. It is making the prices that we pay for goods and that we charge for goods uncompetitive, and that is costing us jobs. This Government does not seem too interested in that, since it has cost this country over one million jobs. Over one million people are looking for work because those sitting opposite do not have the brains to run the country properly. I only hope they have the brains to call an election sooner rather than later so that they can be tipped out and we can be put in; so that this wholesale sales tax system can be tipped out; and so that a simple goods and services tax can be put in. That will make us a much more competitive nation and it will generate real jobs. </PARA>

It is a hidden consumption tax&mdash;a tax which, as Senator Vanstone has said, cascades down through all products, including food.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the absolute nonsense of Labor candidates in the Victorian election running around handing out little brochures saying that 15 per cent will be added to the cost of every item of food. One of the brochures I have seen does have the good grace to show an example of a list of items from the supermarket. The wholesale sales tax is taken off, although there is no indication of what it is so that people know what is on their confectionary, what is on their pet food and what is on all the other items, such as carbonated drinks, they buy in the supermarket, and can then add on 15 per cent. All the other taxes that we are taking off under the Fightback package are not taken off. These candidates are putting around propaganda that is just wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike the coalition's goods and services tax, the Labor Government's consumption tax is not visible. It is not an up-front consumption tax; it is quite the opposite. It is a hidden tax that is levied at the wholesale level without the vast majority of Australians even knowing about it. The older Australian who goes down to the supermarket to buy the pet food does not know it, but he or she is paying wholesale sales tax on that pet food. People are paying wholesale sales tax on their tonic water so that they can have a gin and tonic at night. They are paying a hidden tax. It is not fair; it is not broadly based; and it is not a single rate like the coalition's goods and services tax. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Flavoured milk and plain milk is a perfect example. The Government's consumption tax is not levied at a single rate, it is ramshackle and it is levied arbitrarily on different products at different rates ranging from 10 per cent to a massive 30 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite unlike the coalition's GST, the Government's hidden consumption tax is a tax on business. Whereas a GST is fully rebatable on all business inputs throughout the production cycle, the Government's consumption tax is in-built into the cost of many goods&mdash;including Weetbix&mdash;used by business and not one cent of this in-built cost is rebatable. This means that the Government's consumption tax unnecessarily distorts the choice of production processes and the choice of products produced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike our GST, the Government's consumption tax, as Senator Vanstone has so graphically pointed out, is also a tax on tax, because it is not rebated at each level of production. It has a cascading or a pyramidal effect whereby each seller throughout the production process includes the effect of the tax in his or her mark-up price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's consumption tax is particularly destructive because it increases the costs of our exports and reduces the competitiveness of our struggling primary producers and manufacturers. The fact that the vast majority of our overseas trading partners are not burdened by this sort of debilitating consumption tax on the goods they export to Australia makes it even more difficult for our exporters. Unlike the Government's consumption tax, the coalition's GST will not apply to exports. They will be zero rated, meaning that the GST will not be charged to exports, while exporters will get the GST on their business inputs rebated to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another major difference between the coalition's proposed GST and the Government's consumption tax is the fact that the coalition has given an undertaking, which will be written into the legislation, that the rate of the GST will not rise above 15 per cent and that it will have to be debated here in Parliament. In stark contrast, the Government is constantly both increasing the rates of its consumption tax on individual items and applying its consumption tax to new items. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give just a few examples of the widening of the coverage of the consumption tax since 1983. In the 1983-84 Budget, new items to which Labor's consumption tax was applied included oil and lubricant for business or industrial purposes&mdash;another tax on the trucks that get the food to the supermarket in the long run&mdash;matches, non-agricultural tractors, ride-on mowers, skin care creams, disinfectant, swimming pool parts and filters, soda bicarbonate and non-irrigation guttering, piping and tubing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the end of 1985, Labor's consumption tax had been applied to alcoholic wine and cider, low-alcohol beer and imported horses. In the 1986-87 Budget, Labor's consumption tax was extended to non-alcoholic wines and cider, packaged flavoured milk, Australian fruit juices, bathroom fittings, sinks, tubs&mdash;a real luxury&mdash;toilets, and the development of photographic film. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1988-89 Labor's consumption tax was applied to wrapping material for marketing use, pre-packaged coffee, chocolate and malt drinks, muesli bars, ice-creams and containers for marketing alcoholic beverages. In the 1990-91 Budget, at the same time as the Government announced its simplification and amalgamation of the wholesale sales tax system, the Government extended sales tax to newspaper supplements and inserts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Probably the most despicable thing about the Government's consumption tax, and a major difference between it and the coalition's GST, is the fact that the Government has not seen fit to pay one cent of compensation to taxpayers for the $10 billion it takes from them annually in wholesale sales tax. Since it came to power in 1983, the Hawke-Keating Labor Government has increased the amount of money it stealthily takes in wholesale sales tax by 60 per cent in real terms. Today the Government's consumption tax amounts to 5.4 per cent on everything we buy. This is actually higher than the net effect of the coalition's GST, which is estimated to be 4.4 per cent by the coalition and less than 4 per cent by the Treasury. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the fact that under Labor the annual amount of wholesale sales tax collected has risen from $3 billion to $10 billion, Australians have not received one cent of compensation to make up for the decline in the purchasing power of their earnings. In stark contrast, the coalition will ensure that all Australians are compensated for the GST through tax cuts averaging 30 per cent, through an 8 per cent increase in pensions, through a higher tax-free threshold, through a doubling in family allowance for low income families, through a 6 per cent increase in other social security benefits, through GST tax credits for people who cannot be fully compensated through tax cuts or benefit increases, and through wealth compensation for the effect of GST on the value of people's savings. There is simply no comparison between this comprehensive compensation package for the GST and the total lack of compensation by the current Labor Government for its consumption tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final major difference between Labor's consumption tax and the coalition's GST is the comparative cost of their administration. Labor's consumption tax imposes a huge administrative burden on Australian business. This complex, cost-ineffective tax is characterised by many exemptions and differential rates and has long been plagued by problems relating to valuations and classifications. Because of its complexity, it is estimated that about $400m in staff costs is spent annually by businesses in complying with the Government's consumption tax. Another $100m is spent by businesses annually on the professional fees of lawyers and accountants to assist in interpreting Labor's anachronistic consumption tax. In addition, the Australian Taxation Office employs some 763 personnel nationally to administer the Government's costly and cumbersome consumption tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to point out a couple of examples of administrative problems which are entailed in the administration of the Government's consumption tax. The first is the application of wholesale sales tax to veterinary materials. Item 6 of the first schedule of the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act provides a sales tax exemption for:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Goods (and parts therefor) for use in the maintenance of livestock, viz.:-</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(13) Veterinary instruments, appliances and materials of a kind ordinarily used by veterinary surgeons.</PARA>
<PARA>While it appears from item 6 that the Parliament wished to restrict the exemption `for use in the maintenance of livestock', this was not the practice of the Commissioner of Taxation, who for some years applied the compensation to all veterinary materials. However, earlier this year the Government moved to fix a date for the commencement of the stricter interpretation of this subitem which would have extended Labor's consumption tax to veterinary products used to treat household pets. That would have meant that people who were paying wholesale sales tax on their pet food would now be paying wholesale sales tax also on veterinary products used to treat their animals at home. However, due to complaints lodged by the veterinary field and the Opposition, prior to a date being fixed the Treasurer announced that no change to the current practice would occur. Item 166 of the first schedule of the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Bill now provides for an exemption for veterinary instruments, appliances, materials and preparation of a kind ordinarily used or prescribed by veterinary surgeons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, in the 1986-87 Budget, the Labor Government announced that, in situ, in-ground swimming pools would be subject to a 20 per cent consumption tax. Earlier this year, the High Court ruled that legislation which made swimming pools constructed on site taxable by deeming them to be goods for sales tax purposes had no effect. The legislation had sought to have in-ground swimming pools treated in the same way as off-site, prefabricated swimming pools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The High Court ruled that a swimming pool constructed in situ forms part of the land and is denied the character of the goods, the majority holding that the tax imposed was not a tax on goods but a tax on land. The High Court ruled that the restriction imposed by section 55 of the Constitution requiring laws imposing duties of excise to deal with duties of excise only could not be avoided by deeming them to be, as they are not. We do not have to go on and on with what happened and how the Government had to twist and turn to try to rectify that situation with legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to give another example tonight in this chamber of a situation that I find absolutely appalling. A manufacturer of a product produces it and decides, on reading the Sales Tax Act, that wholesale sales tax should not be charged on the item. So he does not charge it. He is then visited by the Australian Tax Office and told, `You should have charged wholesale sales tax on this item. You owe us all this wholesale sales tax'. `No, I don't', says the manufacturer, `I've read the Tax Act'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After a number of visits from the Tax Office, he is told, `We are going to take you to court and we'd like to speak to your lawyer'. The manufacturer says, `I do not have a lawyer'. He is then told, `Well, you had better get one because you are going to court'. `If that is the case', says the manufacturer, `I will speak to all the other people who manufacture this product who have been charging wholesale sales tax'. What then happened? The Tax Office came back with an agreement and said, `Tell the manufacturer to sign this, but do not publish it as part of the agreement. If he does not tell the other manufacturers, he will not be liable to pay this. Although he is still liable for it, he will not be liable at this moment to pay that wholesale sales tax'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is blackmail. That is what we are getting with this corrupt and ramshackle wholesale sales tax system. Decisions are being made which are corrupt and which involve people in blackmail. It is appalling. That is what is happening in this country. Our tax system is in such disarray that we are seeing an agreement struck between a manufacturer and the Tax Office so that the other people who are charging wholesales sales tax do not know about it. That is what is happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that manufacturer publishes that information, he will be liable to pay that debt. It is disgraceful. It is not acceptable, and that is what is being perpetrated by this archaic and out of date wholesale sales tax system. That is what we are trying to get rid of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The swimming pool example was but one that reached the High Court. I do not know how many other agreements have been made between the Tax Office and manufacturers&mdash;maybe one day I will find out&mdash;but I do know that there has been an agreement made on one occasion and it is totally unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In stark contrast to the Government's consumption tax, the coalition's GST is a straightforward tax for business to administer. Business knows where it stands; it knows whether it should be charging it. There is not some discussion or debate between the Tax Office and the manufacturer about whether the tax should be charged on an item and, if the manufacturer has not charged tax, whether it owes money, as in the ridiculous situation I have just mentioned. It will be levied at a single rate on all sales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Submitting a GST return will entail a one-page statement of business inputs and sales. Any business which maintains records of its costs and sales will face little or no administrative costs in complying with the GST. We will not have the business of agreements and the situation of businesses not knowing whether they should charge a GST. It will be charged. If it is not at the end of the production line, the input cost of the GST that is paid by the next line of production will be rebatable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Business will also receive a substantial cash flow benefit through being able to hold on to the GST received from sales being made between collection periods. It will also get a cash flow benefit now. If I am a jeweller or I have items in a shop which attract wholesale sales tax, and I have a large number of items, all that wholesale sales tax sits on the shelf until I sell those items. There might be 30 per cent in tax on some items. I have borrowed the money from the bank. With the interest rates the way that they were last year, I am paying interest on all that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But under the GST that tax will be rebatable, so I will get another benefit. A coalition government will also provide income tax deductibility for any additional capital equipment needed to accommodate the GST. As we are debating these Bills, which will supposedly simplify a ramshackle and archaic wholesales sales tax system that is beyond repair and really should be abolished, it is imperative that the people of Australia realise that the Labor Government continues to levy a consumption tax of its own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Comparing the Government's consumption tax with the coalition's GST is like comparing chalk and cheese. The coalition's GST is a broadly based, up-front and highly visible tax. As I said before, it will be levied at a single rate which will not be raised beyond 15 per cent. It will be fully rebatable on all business inputs and will not apply to exports. The coalition will provide a comprehensive compensation package to offset the inflation effects of its GST, which will replace seven current taxes. I have said this before and I will keep saying it: finally, the GST will be simple and inexpensive to administer and will result in substantial cash flow benefits for business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other side of the coin, Labor's consumption tax, which it calls a wholesales sales tax, is levied arbitrarily at rates ranging from 10 per cent to 30 per cent on a wide range of goods which are used every day by Australians. Labor's consumption tax is a cascading tax which also impacts indirectly on the price of many everyday items, including Weetbix, as Senator Vanstone pointed out. Unlike the GST, it is not fully rebatable on all business inputs. Labor's consumption tax applies to exports, making it more difficult for Australian exporters to compete with overseas traders which do not levy such an incentive sapping tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last 10 years, Labor has increased more than threefold the amount of money it collects from Australians through its consumption tax. But, as I have said before, it has not seen fit to provide one cent of compensation to taxpayers to offset its effect on their purchasing power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, due to its many exemptions, classifications and variable rates, Labor's consumption tax is cumbersome, very expensive for business to administer and, as I said before, leads to anomalies which mean that some manufacturers may be charging GST and some may not, or that some people enter into agreements with the Tax Office, which I find totally unacceptable. I am sure that when the Australian public is made aware of all the facts and it is given the opportunity to make an informed comparison between Labor's consumption tax and the coalition's GST, the vast majority will agree with me that the GST is infinitely superior. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A couple of weeks ago, I was in New Zealand with Mr Reith in a factory that manufactures electrical goods. We went to the factory floor and chatted with some of the young people soldering in the component parts area. We asked them, `What do you think about the GST?'

We then said, `If you accept that the Government has to get money for defence, health and care for old people and it gets it from taxes, you are now paying income tax and a GST'. Let us assume that they were getting about the right amount of money&mdash;and we could argue about that. We asked, `Would you like the Government to increase your income tax and get rid of the GST, or do you want to keep the GST and have the tax as it is?'. One young fellow said, `Keep the GST'. He was not in favour of the GST at the beginning, but when he had the option of having either higher income tax or a GST, that is what he opted for. Do you know what he said? He said, `If I go out and choose to spend my money on sausages, I pay less GST. If I choose to buy steak, I pay more GST. It is fairer'. This came straight from the factory floor.

Mr Keating himself wanted to do that. How he can backtrack now is beyond my belief. I assure the Senate and my colleagues that I will do everything in my power in the run-up to the next election to convince Australians of the importance of the need to reform the tax system, but not in the ridiculous way the Government has tried to do it by patching up the wholesale sales tax. </PARA>

I would just like to try to bring the debate into some reasonable perspective.

I would certainly commend the speech to all Government members. I will just quote a few pieces as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not of course argue that the only voice a government should listen to is the business community. But I do say that when weighing up the various views about structure and levels of taxation, a government should pay closest attention to the views of business.

<PARA>A little later on he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But what would be best of all is that the introduction of the GST . . . as odd as it may at first appear, the aim of the GST is to lower taxes . . . If Australia is to emerge from recession, it will first be essential that taxes and excessive Government spending are wound back.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The importance of the GST is that it will allow other forms of taxation to be reduced.</PARA>
<PARA>Again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The GST is also useful in improving the trade balance since exports are not subject to the tax while imports are.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The absence of a properly constituted consumption tax needlessly penalizes the Australian economy since the virtues of this change in the tax mix are well understood and the practical results can be observed in virtually all other industrialized economies.</PARA>
<PARA>That is only the ACCI and I suppose those opposite would say, `What would it know?' It represents the entire productive sector of Australian industry, that is all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill that went into the House of Representatives on 26 May passed through that chamber with no proper debate of any sort and it was brought in on the guise of being a so-called tax simplification process&mdash;anything else but not that; nothing could be further from the truth. It was obviously brought in with very limited discussion from people with any knowledge on the subject, as was borne out by the submissions that were made when it went to the Senate committee. Almost 150 submissions were made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If those people had been adequately consulted at the time the legislation was being prepared, the legislation would not have come forward in that condition in the first place and it would not have been necessary for these people to have made submissions. Then we had the farce of trying to cram that into two days of hearings. I think it is important to consider what Coopers and Lybrand said in its submission because it is an expert in the tax field. It said in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As sales tax is a self-assessing tax, it is imperative that this `new law', which replaces existing sales tax legislation, meets all the tests of a good statute, ie simplicity, equity, efficiency and certainty. In generality, in our opinion, the legislation as it presently exists, fails all four tests.</PARA>
<PARA>So far, not one Government member has been able to produce a case that would in any way defend the present wholesale sales tax. It is a ramshackle mess that has grown and grown and is now virtually falling to pieces under the weight of its own production. As we know, the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) made various changes, but not the sorts of changes that were going to improve it. As various witnesses have confirmed, the Government has done everything other than reduce the confusion, uncertainty and concern of the Bills. The Treasurer's about-turn emasculates much of the two-year simplification exercise to rehash the old system and has left it without the certainty that the previous legislation had.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a number of witnesses said, it will not make the sales tax one bit easier or simpler for taxpayers. That was one of the things that we understood from their very titles&mdash;the tax simplification Bills. The Government has done anything but make it simpler. It goes to show that the Government has a total lack of understanding of the tax process and the effects of it. It is the real double whammy, and by increasing sales tax we have become even less competitive in other countries than we already are. The legislation would make</PARA>
<PARA>many more people unemployed&mdash;it has already made hundreds of thousands of workers unemployed&mdash;and it will continue to do so. It has discouraged investment, but still the Government presses on. I quote from Steven Kates's speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So the question that business can answer is how best to structure the tax system so that business can pay taxes in ways which least harm production. What it does indicate is that business prefers a tax system which will least interfere with its ability to generate the greatest amount of production. You would think that would be the kind of tax system every government would want to encourage.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course one would think that. But that is not the way it is turning out. It makes me wonder how many members opposite have owned and operated businesses where sales tax was a feature of everyday life. The stupidity and the hassles that go with the sales tax regime are a nuisance, a nightmare and a terrible disincentive to many people in business. Honourable senators know that there is only one way to handle the wholesale sales tax, and that is to abolish it. If we bring our taxes up-front and let the people know what the tax is, they will be much better off. As I understand the figures, since this Government came into power, sales tax has increased by 223 per cent. </PARA>

That is no way to run a tax operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tax on production is one more item destroying Australia's ability to compete with other countries. It matters not whether we are talking of competing in Australia against exports or in overseas markets. It goes on just the same. For instance, I display here two volumes that come from Singapore. They just happen to be books describing what that country will do to assist industry to overcome the problems of dealing with other countries. If we were serious about our trade issues, we would be doing something like that too. Instead, we are hitting everyone who is competing with imports or trying to build up an export market with taxes all the way through that they cannot avoid under these circumstances. Tax on production is a real killer, a stupid killer. What other countries would ever try to do the same thing?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was recently in Victoria at a car parts plant which has been transferred largely to New Zealand. I was told there that the cost in Australia they must use is the net labour cost plus 51 per cent. Having built the factory in New Zealand and transferred the main part of the enterprise there, the cost is the New Zealand net wage figure plus 17 per cent. So much of that cost in Australia is taxes, including sales tax, and rates and so on, but it makes us uncompetitive in the real world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sales tax is a tax on production, a tax on investment, a tax on employment and a tax on international competitiveness. It determines very much who gets the sale. Twenty-one out of 24 OECD countries are against our present system and, as a result, they will beat us on the world markets nearly every time. Please, cannot Government members see that we are on the wrong track in the world arena?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would not matter whether they were right, which they are not. The dictates of the world demand that Australia does not penalise itself if we are trying to survive.

The Bill and the theory behind it are flawed, and we all know it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we follow this route, we have a guaranteed direct route to further economic decline. The present taxes are business based.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Look at the effects of the wrong tax policy. We have lost tens of thousands of businesses. We are buying what we used to make. We are discouraging those who could help and we owe the people we buy from $150,000m on our purchases. At the same time, remember that a place such as Taiwan, which is half the size of Tasmania, does it differently. It has $A100,000m in overseas credits. I point that out to the Government, because if it really studied the matter it might work out that there could be some connection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look to the other side to see how many Government members have ever employed people in the productive sector. I then have to ask: what would they know about employing people? Would they, if they did know, whip in yet another round of sales taxes, super taxes, training levies or taxes under any of the other names that they give them? How would they know what the effect is on the ordinary, little struggling business that is trying to make Australia survive, export and compete with imports? How many of them over there have laid awake at night worrying about whether there would be orders tomorrow; whether they would survive without some new equipment that they cannot afford; how they were going to fund the Christmas pay; and how they would compete with imports or big industry or whatever?</PARA>

Look at the changes that have been made and the mess that it is still in. Whatever happened to consultation?  What a mess the legislation is in! At present, there are still outstanding unsatisfactory issues: the general anti-avoidance provision and the fact that there is no protection for taxpayers who are acting genuinely in the course of commerce or trade; the situation in respect of rulings and the continuing uncertainty that revolves around the issue; the continued speculation about external costs; the administrative compliance arrangements; the many and varied exemption anomalies and inconsistencies; the tax treatment of deemed manufacturers; and the discrimination against two Australian oil companies. However, the Government still expects us to pass this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The hearings revealed that the Government's proposed new wholesale sales tax would include a tax on food, a tax on services, a tax on exports, a tax on tourism, a tax on farmers, a tax on many manufacturers, double taxation, a tax on infrastructure and a tax on plant and buildings. All these things are ahead of us the way we are heading now. This ramshackle wholesale sales tax legislation is an absolute mess. It is a disgrace that it has got to the state that it is in. I, too, want to know why it is that, if a spoonful of chocolate is placed in a glass and a cap is put on it, it is taxable whereas it is not taxable if one puts it in oneself. I am talking about things like this. The inconsistencies of it are crazy. The administration of it is a nightmare for the people who are supposed to administer it and for the people who are having it administered.

In particular, I chose to come into this debate mainly to correct the appalling errors put into it by the Opposition.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the ways Senator Patterson says the Opposition proposes to compensate people is by reducing personal income tax. I decided not to interject on her at the time, but I do suggest that Senator Patterson checks out the number of times personal income tax has been cut since this Government has been in office. If she claims that could be a compensation for the Opposition, then clearly she should acknowledge that there has been considerable compensation to people under the Labor Government. I do not know whether one would say it was compensation; it is just that the Government has, on a number of occasions, very significantly reduced personal income tax. The Government has also done a number of other things by way of addressing the needs of people through family payments, setting benchmarks for the cost of rearing children and so on. But I do not want to trawl over those items, at least at this stage. I want to have a look at the appalling errors from those opposite. </PARA>

<PARA>In the course of that speech Senator Knowles accused Government members of being `liars', and she was reminded that that kind of language was unparliamentary. I do not know what to say in this place about Senator Knowles. If one goes around insisting that cosmetics and sanitary items are taxed at 30 per cent, then one suffers from the inability to get it right; one is very, very ignorant; wickedly ignorant; or one is fibbing&mdash;to quote Senator Knowles, `telling whoppers'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But for the record, there is no wholesale sales tax on sanitary products. That was removed in 1948. My view is that probably around 1948 we did not need cotton wadding for the war effort. I cannot imagine why else, but there were probably other reasons. But sanitary products have not had a wholesale sales tax on them since 1948. They are not taxed at 10, 20 or 30 per cent. They have no tax. They are certainly not taxed as luxury items, as Senator Knowles would have us believe. Neither are Tampax although, if one listened to Senator Knowles, one would think that they were. Wrong, Senator Knowles; wickedly wrong. Tampax may come with strings attached but they have no tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition policy is going to put a 15 per cent goods and services tax on these products. Those opposite are going to force women to pay 15 per cent more for all those sanitary products, which are already a significant cost to any household that has one or more women in it. Madam Acting Deputy President, you would know as I do the considerable burden that places on many families with one or two teenage daughters or more; I refer to the cost each month from their household budgets. Under the Opposition, those products will cost 15 per cent more. Those opposite, of course, will dodge and twist on this. They have got it wrong. There is no tax on Tampax or sanitary products; there will be a 15 per cent goods and services tax if the Opposition comes into government. They are, I think, forcing women to consider going back into rags, and that is because the goods and services tax policy in this area is in tatters. </PARA>

It is quite outrageous that some people, in particular, women senators opposite, who should know better, are going around the country telling that great whopper to the people of Australia.

Wrong, Senator Knowles. They are charged a 20 per cent wholesale sales tax and, indeed, it will be more or less the same price with a 15 per cent goods and services tax; not much to argue about there. As Ms McHugh has said in the other place, and in various speeches, there is not much nutritional value in cosmetics. If the Opposition wants to argue about the 15 per cent wholesales tax on these things, it must know that the prices will not be different, in one way or another, from what they are now.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Knowles went on to say that she was shocked to discover that the `Slip, slop, slap' commercials encouraging people to use sunscreens were to be set back because sunscreens were now enjoying wholesale sales tax. Well, once again, Senator Knowles is wrong. If a sunscreen is above a factor 4&mdash;that is, has a content that prevents the sunburn effects of ultraviolet rays&mdash;up to factor 15, and more, it does not attract a sales tax. I have to say to Senator Knowles that under the Opposition's goods and services tax the hats that people will wear on their heads&mdash;do wear now and will wear in the future&mdash;will attract a 15 per cent goods and services tax. So will the shirts on people's backs; so will the trousers on their legs; and so will the shoes on their feet. Sunscreen is not enjoying a sales tax, if it is a sunscreen. Senator Knowles is wrong on that, but under the goods and services tax the whole campaign will be dramatically different.

He is going to either seduce or force people into buying private insurance; but he is not going to tell people that if they have private insurance they cannot have any guarantee that they will not be hit with very large bills. That is why people are leaving private insurance at the moment. It is no assurance at all. But it is certainly a right to large bills. Any number of us here know of those many stories of people who say, `I have had private insurance all my life to protect me against the costs of going to the doctor or having an operation.

Let me tell honourable senators what the people in Toronto think about the goods and services tax&mdash;over 70 per cent of them loathe and detest it. I had to ride in a taxi or two, and in the taxis they have printed in sort of gritty letters along the edge of their windows the words, `The goods and services tax is already included in this price'. They hate it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At restaurants in Toronto not only do patrons have to work out what to pay for the 15 per cent tip but they also have to add on the 15 per cent goods and services tax. The menu might say $20 for a main course, but it is 30 per cent more than that when the goods and services tax and tip have been paid. Canadian people absolutely hate their goods and services tax! It is very clear what they think about it. I think Australians should be told what it means for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It means increasing costs by 15 per cent with a goods and services tax on all the products so critical to everyday living such as food and clothing. It also means that people will have to be taxed when they buy things. That means that people whose disposable income is limited and fixed and largely goes on expenditure will be hit very hard by this goods and services tax, and on any evidence they cannot be adequately compensated for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Opposition proposes to absolutely wreck equity in the name of a goods and services tax. The members of the Opposition do not like equity at all. They also, by the way, have skidded over the fact that many people in the Tax Office will have to be devoted to collecting this goods and services tax. Senator Bishop talked about how many people are currently involved in collecting the wholesale sales tax. I think I am correct in saying that she was told that there were 763&mdash;and it was to be reduced to 740&mdash;officers in that category. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New Zealand, which has a much smaller population and a smaller demand on its tax officers, started off with 1,000 dedicated tax officers for its goods and services tax. Of course, it would have to be much higher in Australia. By way of comparison, the number of dedicated officers for the goods and services tax in Canada was 5,000. So it is quite clear that in Australia the figure would have to be, at a very moderate and conservative estimate, at least 2,500. It would probably need to be more than that, and that is a significant increase on the 763 or 740&mdash;whichever it is currently&mdash;that Senator Bishop was complaining about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bishop did not tell us in detail about how many more officers will have to be involved in Treasury in the collating and collecting, parsing and analysing of the goods and services tax. In the end, it is very simple. The goods and services tax is a 15 per cent charge on the essentials of life&mdash;on food and clothing, rent and services. It is going to be most inequitable because for those people who have low and fixed incomes it is going to affect almost all of their income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is going to be very nice for those on a very high income with the top marginal rate reduced and more choice. Those people will have more opportunity to save. This tax is classically regressive. It is going to be terrible and damning for people on low and fixed incomes and, as part of the package, it is going to give a much easier ride for people on high incomes. It is for those reasons, as well as the fact that it is levied on food and clothing, that I so strongly oppose it. It is regressive and it is unfair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to close on the point that was raised by some members of the Opposition that this tax is 15 per cent and that there it will stay. Honourable senators should wonder about that. In the United Kingdom, the original rate was 10 per cent; now it is 17.5 per cent. In New Zealand, the original rate was 10 per cent; now it is 12.5 per cent. In Austria, the original rate was 8 per cent; now it is 20 per cent. In Sweden, the original rate was 11 per cent; now it is 25 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would not hold my breath about the Opposition keeping its GST at 15 per cent. Of course, it will not do so because, as well as its packet of GST, it is proposing to massively cut government expenditure, so somewhere or other it will have to find the dollars to maintain the services that this Government thinks are so critical to maintaining quality of life and services to people, particularly those on low and middle incomes. Those services are what the Opposition is going to do away with. Quite clearly, not only would the GST be 15 per cent on food and clothing: in no time at all it would be more. The goods and services tax is an appalling tax: it is regressive and it is unfair. As I have said, it comes from the Opposition's mouth time and time again incorrectly, based on gross error to the point where one could say only that the Opposition must intend to get it wrong or else it is so sloppy that it never checks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The points I particularly want to correct tonight relate to the sanitary provisions for women. Pads and Tampax have not had tax on them since 1948, but the Opposition is going to bang a 15 per cent tax on them. Its policy is in tatters. It intends to go to the election on the pad and Tampax tax: not a winner with women. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not a personal explanation. There are actually two misrepresentations. Senator Crowley said there is a clear skating over of the coalition proposal to put 15 per cent on everything. There has been no attempt, and certainly not in my speech, to skate over that. I am sure the record will show in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> later today that I made it abundantly clear that we are going to put a 15 per cent tax on just about everything. If Senator Crowley thinks that I have attempted to misrepresent that case, I think she has misunderstood what I have said. I think I said perfectly clearly that we will put a 15 per cent flat, simple tax on just about everything. There is no walking away from that. It is one of the key elements of the policy that it is so simple and people will not have to work out what the taxes are on this or that category of good.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second aspect of my dispute of Senator Crowley's interpretation of what I have said relates to the question of whether there is a tax on food or clothing. I suspect that Senator Crowley has allowed me to speak tonight by simply at large saying, `Senator Vanstone said blah, blah, blah', because it is clear to me that she probably was not listening to what I was saying. Had she been listening she could not have misunderstood me so drastically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I said was simply that one of the big Labor lies&mdash;one of the biggest&mdash;is to go around saying that the coalition wants to tax food and clothing. The implication contained in that allegation is that there is no tax on food and clothing at the moment. That is exactly what Senator Crowley has tried to imply in here tonight. She has clearly misunderstood that part of my speech that explained the cascading effect of indirect taxes that are not directly placed on individuals but cascade through the system. If you were in the chamber, Madam Acting Deputy President, you will realise that they are measures such as payroll tax and the wholesale sales tax charged on trucks. I will not go through the list again but I did use, at length, the example of wheat coming from the farm, going to the factory, going to the wholesaler, going to the retailer&mdash;there are other goods that do that&mdash;and how at each stage the trucks that carry them have wholesale sales tax on them and the fuel used in those trucks has an excise on it. Those people do not pay that out of the goodness of their hearts, nor do the manufacturers of Weetbix pay the payroll tax out of the goodness of their hearts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I tried to show in my speech, and what I think I clearly did show, was that there is an element of indirect wholesale sales tax on food and clothing, and for anyone in the Labor Party to be saying that there is not a tax on food and clothing at the moment is grossly misrepresenting the truth of the matter. I regard that as one of Labor's big lies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, for Senator Crowley to say that I am, in the first instance, trying to skate over the question of a 15 per cent tax is to misunderstand what I have said. I have said quite clearly that there will be a 15 per cent tax on just about everything. It is one of the key elements of the package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point I wanted to make was that for her to suggest that I have tried to put in the debate tonight something in relation to the tax on food and clothing that does not amount to a tax is to misrepresent what I have said.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the first complete revision of the 1930 sales tax legislation and the measures we are debating tonight stem from the decision announced in the 1990 Budget to review and simplify the sales tax system in its entirety. Some would argue that the Government has done this in response to the Opposition's release of Fightback. Others would say the Government has been working on this for a couple of years. Whatever is correct, I think it could be argued that the package, the simplification, is also a worthwhile initiative in its own right as most of the members of the business and professional community have stated. Inevitably, however, this debate has become the `My GST is better than your WST' debate that we had to have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess it raises the question: what is the purpose of taxation in a developed society? Is it simply to raise revenue for public services? Is it to facilitate business growth which then stimulates employment? Is it a redistributive tool to be used to achieve desirable economic and social results, such as a fair distribution of wealth and income? It is my belief, and the Democrats' belief, that it is a combination of these principles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently, sales tax is imposed at differential rates to reflect social priorities. Exemptions&mdash;those nasty exemptions&mdash;can be used to support charities, hospitals, schools, universities, people with disabilities, and to favour certain products such as recycled products, solar collectors, safety equipment and so on. Further, the multi-tax sales tax system can be used as a disincentive against harmful products to shape consumer preferences in environmentally beneficial ways&mdash;for example, away from inefficient motor vehicles towards fuel efficient ones. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A selective tax can also be used to pursue socially just objectives such as exempting the necessities of life from taxation. It is interesting to note in this regard that not even Mrs Thatcher proposed to tax food, children's clothing and so on, although she is the one who actually implemented the draconian poll tax. So perhaps she thinks taxing the necessities of life is more draconian than that. But giving up such an important economic policy tool of discriminating in favour of a flat rate, non-discriminatory tax will please only those who advocate that our values and priorities should be shaped solely by the market&mdash;the total hands-off approach of the Opposition. I am not an advocate of the market at any cost, and in any event we all know the theory is completely flawed because it assumes that there is perfect information and perfect competition as a natural state. Everybody knows this is absolutely ridiculous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike the coalition, for whom it is survival of the fittest, or `Stand there and wait, and if you are lucky it will trickle down to you', I believe that government has a role. It has a responsibility for the well-being of the community, and it must have the capacity to intervene when the need arises. So when I am asked to make a choice between a GST and a WST regime I will continue to choose the wholesale sales tax, not because I denigrate the role of business but mainly because I reject the trade-off that business must be treated most advantageously, and that other social policy must fall into line behind this priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not put business ahead of battling families who struggle to feed their kids properly or disabled veterans who can currently buy their motor vehicles free from tax. They are equally important. I do not want to allow more luxury cars to be imported whilst unemployed Australian workers do not have the dignity of a decent job with fair industrial rights. In other words, I think it is fair to discriminate and I think that is much more important than the claims made for the merits of the GST. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition is arguing that the wholesale sales tax system is in need of repeal, not reform. The Democrats reject that position. We all know there are some problems with sales tax; this legislation addresses many of them, and there will be further changes after this. However, this is not a weakness in the system. It is simply reflecting the fact that, like all other bodies of law, indirect taxation needs to be constantly finetuned to achieve optimal outcomes. This finetuning will involve altering classifications to either stimulate or contract the demand for the particular product concerned. In particular, I think we could go to a system which increases the taxation on luxury items, especially those which are imported, and reduces the taxes on those items which contribute to sustainable development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wholesale sales tax was introduced in 1930, during the Depression, to address the collapse in customs duties which was being experienced by the Scullin Government. It is perhaps appropriate that this time of the worst economic downturn since the Depression is the time chosen to reform and modernise the system. The Opposition is calling this the `so-called simplification'. I think that is totally disingenuous because without question this is the largest scale taxation legislation simplification project&mdash;or what I would call a streamlining project&mdash;ever undertaken. The volume of legislation is being more than halved. The drafting style is plain English and the extremely cumbersome system of multiple assessment and imposition Acts is to be reduced by over 20 pieces of legislation. Is that not enough?  According to the Opposition, the system is bad because it discriminates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without committing the Democrats to supporting every detail of the Bills, I would like to acknowledge the work done by the officials of the Tax Office on this project. The supporting material to the Bills&mdash;the explanatory memoranda and the cross-referencing document&mdash;are of a very high standard and deal with the most complex of matters in an understandable way. In addition, the work done for the Select Committee on Sales Tax Legislation by the Tax Office was of a high quality and done under great pressure of time imposed by us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now turn to the specific proposals in the legislation and I may well be the first speaker to do so. Sales tax will be imposed on assessable dealings with assessable goods unless an exemption applies. If the dealing is taxable, tax will be imposed at the rate of tax applicable to the goods. If the goods, or some input to the goods, have already been taxed then a credit for that earlier tax will reduce the tax payable on the later dealing. An assessable dealing may be exempted from tax because one of the parties to the dealing had made a quote. There will be two types of quoting: quoting a registration number by a registered person and quoting an exemption declaration by an unregistered person. There will be general grounds for quoting for both registered and unregistered persons. In addition, there will be special quotation grounds available to registered persons. Registration will be purely voluntary and will be solely to gain access to the special quotation grounds. No special obligations will be imposed on persons who choose to be registered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main assessable dealing will be a wholesale sale. This is similar to the current system and means that the current small number of taxpayers will be maintained. Contrast this with the absolutely massive compliance costs which a GST will impose on all levels of business in Australia and the massively increased administrative task which the Taxation Office would have to undertake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this legislation the multiple rate structure has been maintained. The rates are 0, 10, 15 and 30 per cent. All other goods are taxed at the standard rate of 20 per cent. It is this multiple rate structure which, we say, is so important in any fair indirect tax system. The system is designed so that certain types of consumption are favoured by the tax system and certain types are discouraged. This is a very basic concept, a very fair concept, and a very important tool to encourage, amongst other things, sustainable development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition believes that all consumption should be treated in exactly the same manner. There is no room for preference as an instrument of public policy. Those in the Opposition want to tax the purchase of a hand gun at the same rate as the purchase of an orange. There is no room in their economic model for equity or compassion or price discrimination, to achieve environmental and social goals. My goodness, no, that is not the role of government! In its rigid inflexibility, I believe, they are out of step with public opinion on this issue, and they may well lose the upcoming election because of this rigidity, irrespective of all almost one million people being unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the proposals in this legislation have attracted well-publicised criticism and this has tended to overshadow the other non-contentious changes. I will spend just a few moments dealing with these changes before I deal with the controversial ones. Firstly, the small business exemption is being significantly broadened. Currently, there is an exemption from sales tax for Australian manufacturers whose turnover of goods over a five-year period does not exceed an average of $50,000 per annum or whose sales tax liability does not exceed $1,000 per annum. The legislation proposes to change the existing concession to provide an option sales tax exemption for all taxpayers, not just manufacturers, whose total sales tax liability over a 12-month period does not exceed $10,000; that is, there will be a common exemption for all small businesses which will be considerably simpler than the current system. This will be 10 times as generous as the current system. This will reduce the administrative costs for the Taxation Office and will eliminate the sales tax compliance costs of many small businesses altogether. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do those in the Opposition say in respect of this excellent proposal for small business? They are opposed to it. They will be voting against these Bills&mdash;not because of the intrinsic merit or otherwise of the proposals but because, I think, they are worried that these legislative changes basically make their GST position much less marketable with respect to small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost of this liberalisation is estimated to be $20m to $30m in a full year, and the reason that the cost to revenue is so low is that sales tax is predominantly paid, that is, remitted to the Taxation Office, by very large businesses. The Tax Office's 1991 annual report contained some remittance statistics on page 136. These show that over 90 per cent of the sales tax revenue is remitted by businesses with a liability of over $100,000 and that almost 75 per cent of the revenue is collected from businesses with a liability of over $1m. This just reinforces the huge efficiency&mdash;not the inefficiency, but the huge efficiency&mdash;in terms of administrative and compliance costs which a wholesale based tax system has compared to a multi-stage system. Indeed, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> reported on this matter on 10 June in an article by Christopher Jay entitled `GST Compliance Costs Hit Small Firms'. The article referred to a survey conducted in Britain and it stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Should the Federal Opposition gain office and introduce a Goods and Services Tax, small business can expect to have a compliance cost of almost 2 per cent of turnover.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where business has a $100,000 turnover, it will incur $2,000 costs; and where it has a $500,000 turnover, it will incur $10,000 costs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Those in the Opposition hate all this stuff about compliance and administrative costs, do they not? They hate having to acknowledge it. How can these costs sit comfortably with all the rhetoric that they have about protecting jobs and small business?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the Democrats will be supporting the increased small business exemption. The original Bill has been improved by the additional measure outlined in the Treasurer's press release. We support this further improvement and commend the Government for accepting the representations made by the public on this matter. But at this stage I would wish to publicly question the wisdom of a particular decision which I think Senator Vanstone mentioned tonight, to exempt unprocessed bottled mineral water. I hope the Government has some figures to justify this decision because it really seems to me that if we are being discriminatory, and in our case we would like to look at categories of luxury goods, it is ludicrous to exclude what is accepted as a luxury product, much of it imported, at a time of massive current account deficit and huge hardship for the unemployed and families in this country. Other items have had their exemptions removed or their rate of tax increased, for example, containers for takeaway food, ornamental crockery or glassware, and pet food except for that used for guide dogs or in animal shelters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will be moving an amendment during the Committee stage to introduce a dual rate system of taxing takeaway food packaging because I think the tax system should recognise that some packaging material is more benign than other materials and it should be taxed at a lower rate. We have seen the effect of taxation preference in the area of recycled paper. There is now a major industry of paper recycling in this country and some significant proposals, including the Albury mill proposal, for further expanding the industry. So discriminatory taxes can also create real, sustainable jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other areas where we should be following this type of model with other recycled products such as recycled plastic products, and with all commercial reuses of goods. An example of this latter category is the excellent printer cartridge recycling program which is run by Gestetner and which is used by the Department of the Senate. Taxing harmful products, non-recyclable products, can only discourage their use. I am not saying that taxation is the only instrument that should be used to influence industry development but I think it is a very important one. Often the Government acknowledges this point&mdash;Senator McMullan has done so repeatedly in this chamber&mdash;but usually the Government says, `We oppose this reasonable initiative at this stage but we will take it away and look at it and maybe come back later'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One could go on all night about this legislation. Indeed, I expect that the Opposition probably will. Senator Archer said that we have to do something better and fairer than the WST. I do not believe the GST is either better or fairer and the fact of the matter is that many commentators, especially the professionals who are going to have to work with the legislation, acknowledge that it has intrinsic merit and deserves passage, and the Democrats agree. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard Senator Crowley and others talking about the Goods and Services Tax, while clearly not understanding&mdash;or deceiving both themselves and the public about the fact&mdash;that, since this Government came to office, they have hijacked the wholesale sales tax legislation and rammed it up from $2.8 billion to $9.5 billion, a milch cow of revenue. As I recall, it was during Senator Walsh's time that, so that they did not have to come back each Budget and announce that cigarettes were going up, and petrol was going up, and alcohol was going up, and the cost of bread was going up, and the cost of milk was going up, and the cost of toiletries was going up, they decided that they would automatically put them up in this insidious, surreptitious way without legislation. The costs were increased quarterly by the CPI. In other words, it happened without one knowing about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a government that agitates for honesty in labelling.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I find obscene about this debate is the fact that the Labor Party does not pretend or purport to put forward an intellectually compelling argument. Labor senators do not stand and argue on the logic. They will not compete in the debate on the merits. They will simply get up and repeat their obscene lie that the goods and services tax is a 15 per cent increase on the cost of living and the cost of ordinary goods. They know it is a lie; the Australian public is understanding it is a lie. But it is the very best argument that they have in this campaign&mdash;the best argument they can come up with. They are not prepared to argue; they are not prepared to campaign; they are not prepared to go into the next election arguing on truth and honesty. They have resorted, as they always have at the last minute, to a fear campaign which is enshrined in lies. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of outstanding matters have been raised by the Committee members on this side, Senators Vanstone and Short. They refer particularly to the concern about the general anti-avoidance provisions. I have to say that, when one reads the original proposals in respect of those anti-avoidance provisions, they send a cold shiver down one's back. In particular, the Commissioner wants to determine the following matters in the following way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first is that particular things are to be treated as not having happened. This is Alice in Wonderland stuff. Was it the rabbit, or Alice? Secondly, particular things are to be treated as having been done by a different person or to have happened at a different time. Thirdly, particular things that did not actually happen are to be treated as having happened and taken to have happened at a particular time or to have been done by a particular person. That is a particularly complicated interpretation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the highlighting of the abhorrence of that proposal, the anti-avoidance provisions were changed, except to say that there is no safe harbour to the extent that that is necessary. There is no encompassing provision that an act performed in the normal commercial form and way is to be assumed to be done for the right purposes and therefore will hold at law. The Commissioner has the power right now to say that something that is perfectly normal, perfectly commercial, perfectly legitimate, in his view was not even done. But to the extent that there has been modification, there has been some relief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other matters in respect of untaxed goods and small business exemptions. Tax rulings are another problem. We are now told that the thousands of rulings that the Commissioner has been giving over all these years are private rulings and have no general application. Because of the simplicity proposals, those rulings thus far were to be made null and void and new rulings were to apply in each individual and personal case. One can imagine the complications that that would put in train for people seeking to make judgments as to how to organise themselves in an orderly and proper way. We are told that there has been some modification to that provision, save that each ruling is still a private reading. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I shall not proceed past that point, other than to refer the problems that Caltex and, I think, Ampol have and the terrible mess the Government got itself into in seeking to deal with that. There are still problems. For instance, in this enlightened age when even the Government understands privatisation, if a government contracts out to private enterprise to build a road and a toll bridge, that will now attract a wholesale sales tax. But if they are built by a contractor for a government agency, that tax will not apply. I assume that in future years we will see more and more private constructions, both constructed and operated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with the tax treatment I have deemed to be the manufacturers as well. If my memory serves me correctly, at the present time under this proposal if a person buys a hamburger from Hungry Jack's he will be paying wholesale sales tax on the container. But if I am right again, if a person goes into Woolworths and buys its home brand already wrapped and contained, there is no wholesale sales tax on the container. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is just a modest example of the nonsense that the Government, of which honourable senators opposite are members, is seeking to inflict upon the Australian community. There is no logic to it. There is no simple way of solving it because it is a ramshackle process. There is no justification for something being 20 per cent, something being 30 per cent and something else being 10 per cent. Why should toothpaste attract a sales tax of 20 per cent, but Australian fruit and vegetable juice attract a tax of 10 per cent? Why should garbage bins attract a sales tax of 10 per cent, but razors attract 20 per cent? Why should razors attract a sales tax of 20 per cent, but a watch and a clock attract 30 per cent?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that when the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) gets up, he will be able to explain the logic of that. He will go through the items and say, `Look, this is a sensible way of approaching it'. We will all be nodding furiously and saying, `Why didn't we realise that?'. Of course, it is so simple. Everybody understands that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth of the matter is that it is a process that has been built on again and again. The rates have been struck for revenue, the items have been struck for revenue.

If it is an item that the affluent people are likely to buy, it will be stuck in there because it will probably raise more revenue&mdash;although I do not think toothpaste is restricted to the affluent in Australia!</PARA>

Despite Hawke's protestations about not wanting to be popular, and about wanting to do the right thing for Australia and for our kids, in the face of the ACTU saying that it would be unpopular, he capitulated. As he walked out the door capitulating, Paul Keating was still behind the door waving it on, saying that it was a good idea.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is indeed a privilege to speak in this debate following Senator Crichton-Browne and that very precise and almost exquisitely intelligent speech that he made. It was a speech that shows how important it is to stay and listen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I start by noting for the record that the time is 1.56 a.m. and that we are here debating very important legislation at this hour in the morning because of yet another grubby deal between the Australian Democrats and this Government, a grubby deal that has us sitting here at all hours, with people getting very excited and almost emotional. I want to refer to comments made by Senator Kernot, who spoke just a couple of speakers back. She became very excited and very agitated at the beginning of her speech, and one cannot blame her, as she was trying to debate intelligently legislation at this hour of the morning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been through this a number of times over many years. The last time we did this was when we were debating, as I recall, the broadcasting legislation, when the Democrats and the Government got together in an absolute perversity of democracy. We spoke all morning to try to prevent a Bill being passed. We told the Democrats time and time again that they should not join with the Government in putting this sort of perverse legislation through. They ignored us then. We spoke all night and, in the fullness of time, the High Court has done in relation to the broadcasting legislation what we predicted it would do. It has thrown the legislation out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats never seem to learn. Again they come up with some deal: `Do something for us and we'll let the Senate go all night. We'll make the Parliament sit all night, as long as we get something'. This is the way this country is run&mdash;by deals, by little huddles outside, by grubby little arrangements and agreements simply to get this Government through the legislative program it has set itself; to get it through legislation which, as my colleagues have said in the many good and precise speeches before me, is flawed legislation. It is legislation that should not be allowed and, of course, should not be debated at this hour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can only say that it is no wonder that the Democrats are in such disarray and in such a turmoil over the attitudes they take. I can well understand why the Victorian membership of the Democrats is split asunder, why the New South Wales membership has all sorts of problems&mdash;fights against each other and police being called in to look at different things&mdash;and why in Queensland there are not even enough members to have official party starters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can only wonder as to what Senator Kernot's quite strange speech was all about. One of the reasons for the split, as quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>, was Senator Kernot's attempt to water down the Democrats' opposition to the GST. That was said by Darren Koch, who is the national economic policy convener of the Democrats. One wonders, after listening to Senator Kernot's speech, whether she or Mr Koch have any idea whatsoever about the GST or how it is likely to impact on Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other silly thing about the legislation that the Government is bringing forward for debate tonight is that the Government seems to be getting ready for what might happen, or what would happen, should the Australian public be ridiculous enough to return it to office. In the very unfortunate, and almost unbelievable, event that the Government is returned, one can be assured that this Government will bring in its own goods and services tax. However, in typical fashion, the Government will not tell anyone about it before the election; it will just bring it in afterwards. The Government will run to the election on one policy, and, come the first session after the election, it will bring in its own form of consumption tax. We know the Government will do that because it is Mr Keating's preferred way. It is the way that the advisers in Treasury want him to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With a $50 billion hole in the finances, there really is no other way that the Government can go to find the money it needs. There is a $50 billion hole in the finances that this Government will have available to it over the next two or three years. It is almost $14 billion this year&mdash;although those figures were fudged; it is much more than that. I think it is $11 billion next year, $9 billion the year after and $8 billion the year after that. But within four or five years, there will be a total of $50 billion unfunded. And where is the Government going to get it from? It will get it from its own GST&mdash;its secret tax, a tax that will be brought in without anyone being told about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that Mr Keating had this as his preferred option in 1985. It was the option he wanted; it is the one he knew had to be done, but he was frightened off by the ACTU and by those people in the Labor Party who thought that winning was the right thing to do, that it was far better to win than to do the right thing by Australia. Of course, one simply cannot trust anything Mr Keating says. He will go to this poll saying that there will be no GST and no consumption tax by his Government, in the unlikely event that it is returned. However, people should not believe anything he says. It was Mr Keating who said, `I think loyalty is the stuff of politics; political parties are built on loyalty'. They are the words of Mr Keating. If people believe that, they will believe that there is not going to be a consumption tax if this Government happens to be returned. Of course we do not believe him, and, certainly, Mr Hawke does not believe him, after that particular statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating also said that it is not true to say that this is the worst recession in 60 years. How can we believe a man who says those sorts of things and then imposes upon us a planned recession which is the worst in 60 years? He said on 22 March 1990, `We will not let there be a recession'. It was just a few days before the last election, of course, but it was a firm and solemn promise: `We will not let there be a recession'. How can the one million officially unemployed or the two million real unemployed Australians possibly believe anything Mr Keating might say when he says that sort of thing? He also said on 19 August 1991, `I am not sitting here desperate to be Prime Minister'. How could anyone possibly believe him? Again, one should ask Mr Hawke about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He said on 21 March 1991, `The worst is now behind us; the Government has established its strategy'. He further said, `We won't destroy business activity; we won't destroy employment'. There are now officially almost one million people unemployed. As I said, it is more like two million, in real terms. He said in the 1988 Budget speech&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President may well remember this&mdash;`We are well on the way to prosperity'. That was just four short years ago. But what have we had since then? We have had increasing unemployment, increasing bankruptcies and a foreign debt that has now become almost uncountable. </PARA>

I do not often agree with Senator McKiernan but in that instance I certainly have to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In spite of the protestations of my friends opposite, it is pretty obvious that, in the very unlikely event of this Government being returned, there will be a GST. Mr Keating has no answers. After 10 years he is still struggling in the wilderness trying to find answers. We have had 17 major economic statements in that time, each one supposedly to set Australia on the way&mdash;17 major economic statements and not one of them has worked. Between now and the next election there will be a continuing series of bribes, of promises&mdash;unfunded promises of the type that I have been quoting, quite crass promises&mdash;although Mr Keating knows full well that he does not believe those promises and he has no intention of abiding by them. He has no answers, no policy at all. His only resort, when he is challenged on any policy, on his failures, is to lapse into a tirade of abuse such as he has become famous for. This is the man who brought us `scumbag', `sleazebag' and `spew'; that is his level, that is all he can do when he is really challenged on economic matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill before us is a package of six Bills which were forced through the lower house, the House of Representatives, in about 45 minutes. We knew even before then and since then even the Government has realised that the Bills are totally flawed. They are an absolute mess. They are a travesty of economic management. I think it is curious today that it is only because the Senate referred those matters to a committee and had the evidence coming in that the Government was able to see its own mistakes and to understand what an absolute mess and botch-up it was making of this legislation. It is curious that, in a day when we have to debate to save this Senate, have to save it from the attacks of this Prime Minister we have, it is the Senate that has saved this legislation  for the Government. If this legislation had not been changed, we would have had in it the ridiculous proposal about sales tax on leases. </PARA>

But, had that legislation gone through, had it not been for the diligence of the Senate and that very efficient Senate committee, for the very first time local authorities would have been subject to a sales tax&mdash;local authorities which for many years prided themselves on the fact that they do not pay sales tax and they do not have taxes on taxes.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Inequities abound in the current sales tax regime. There are, as my colleagues have said, five separate rates: 0, 10, 15, 20 and 30 per cent. Why some should be at one level and some at another I do not really know. I know why the sales tax on some motor vehicles is 15 per cent: it was a desperate attempt by this Government to make ad hoc policy to try to stop the impetus of the Fightback package. When people realised what a tremendous relief our proposals would be, particularly in relation to motor vehicles, the Government succumbed, as it has done with the zone rebate allowance and the coal tax. It keeps pinching bits of our policy, not with any long term economic strategy in mind, but it is simply grabbing bits to try to stave off the tremendous ground swell of voter support that is coming our way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, there are these five quite ridiculous sales tax rates. As my colleagues have said before me, there are different indirect taxes that increase automatically so that no-one even knows what they are.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleagues earlier spoke about packets of cornflakes. I want to refer, very briefly, to the milk that is on the table.

Those same trucks then will have tyres free of sales tax that is now paid, they will have repairs and upkeep free of sales tax that is now paid, and the truck owners will be able to buy their fuel 26c a litre cheaper than they now do. The fuel alone will save them some $24,925 in a year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They will make savings from the abolition of sales tax on tyres in the vicinity of $1,675. The savings they will make from the abolition of sales tax on repairs and upkeep will be some $2,280 per annum&mdash;a total saving just on fuel, tyres and repairs of something like $20,880. If you add to that the saving in the lease payments, which I referred to before, of $11,340, one will have a saving of some $40,220 for that truck in just one year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those taxes currently impost on the ordinary milk that one currently pays for. Sure, there is no direct sales tax but that truck that carts the milk from Malanda to Townsville pays taxes in the year of something in the order of $40,000. That, of course, is added to the cost of the milk. So, whilst there is no direct cost on the milk, a very indirect sales tax is certainly imposed on that milk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is quite ridiculous to say that there is no sales tax on flavoured milk. There is, of course, the direct sales tax on milk.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other way that farmers are particularly burdened by the sales tax is an example that comes to mind in my area in the sugar country. One can buy a four-wheel drive vehicle sales tax free. In the Burdekin most farmers buy four-wheel drive vehicles because they are sales tax free. The job they want them to do does not really require a large four-wheel drive or any sort of four-wheel drive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most farmers just need a little utility so they can throw the shovel in the back and go down to open up the drains somewhere to look after the irrigation water. That does not need an expensive four-wheel drive but farmers buy them because they are sales tax free. All they need is a little two-wheel drive utility that will get them down and back quite easily and would be much cheaper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But they do not buy such a vehicle because of false economy. If they buy those little two-wheel drive trucks they have to pay sales tax on them. So they do not buy that cheaper vehicle which is all they need. They go for the more expensive vehicle through false economy because they do not have to pay sales tax.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, we will be introducing this fair across-the-board GST. It will increase the cost of living by an amount, but that is no big surprise. When we say, `Yes, we acknowledge it will increase costs by something', there are some Labor members who say, `We have got you. Here it is. What a surprise!'. But it is not a surprise. Right from the first day of Fightback, we said fairly and openly&mdash;because that is how we are doing it these days; we are telling it fairly and openly as it is&mdash;that there will an increase in the cost of living. But it will not be 15 per cent. On our figures&mdash;and we calculated them very conservatively&mdash;it will lead to a cost increase of about 4.4 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite naturally, the Government did not believe us. It thought we were fudging the figures, so it got its own Treasury to go and check our figures. What did Treasury come back with? It said we were wrong all right, but we were too high. It said the figure was not 4.4 per cent but 3.6 per cent; that is all it would be. Whether it is 3.6 per cent or 4.4 per cent, I do not suppose it really matters. It is about 4 per cent and we acknowledge that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have then done is to set out to compensate the public, and more than compensate them, for that increase in the cost of living. In the case of pensioners, whose costs of living will go up by about 4 per cent in the year, we have increased their pensions by 8 per cent to cover a 4 per cent cost of living increase. So they are going to be compensated for the 4 per cent and they are going to get a bonus of 4 per cent on top of that. In the case of someone on $20,000 with three children and driving a family motor vehicle, we have said, `Your tax will fall by $15.60 per week'. That is a 4.8 per cent after-tax increase to cover the 4 per cent increase in the cost of living. So there is a 4.8 per cent compensation to cover the 4 per cent cost of living increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that is not all. For the family with three children, in addition to that $15.60 per week&mdash;which means, I repeat, a 4.8 per cent compensation to cover the 4 per cent cost of living increase&mdash;we will give $30 a week extra for family allowance. So that is $15.60 a week tax saving plus $30 a week family allowance. And every time the family fills the car with fuel, it will save something like $10, $11, $12 or $13. </PARA>

It costs you 4 per cent more to live and you would get a tax reduction of 6.8 per cent. And, if a taxpayer has three children, because he or she is in that higher tax bracket, instead of getting $30 a week it will be only $15 a week. That is how we look after those people. It is not the case that the richer people are, the more they get, because we have cut back the family allowance. They will, of course, make the same savings on the tank of fuel.

But on not one occasion did either Duncan Kerr or Mr Gear point out that the wholesale sales tax put on by their Government was the main cause of the problem of this increase. </PARA>

How many families are aware that they are paying a 20 per cent sales tax on washing powder; a 20 per cent sales tax on articles such as watches, clocks, cameras, films and slide projectors? There is a 20 per cent sales tax on beer and wine and, of course, there is excise duty on top of that. </PARA>

Every time they buy a cup or a saucer or a glass, again it is 10 per cent. Every time people strike matches it is 10 per cent. They pay 10 per cent on all soft goods such as curtaining, brooms, buckets, rubbish bins, fridges, heaters, stoves, kettles, vacuum cleaners, washing machines, sewing machines and knitting machines.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1987 Mr Keating took on a new direction; in line with his very firm belief in a consumption tax he decided for the first time he would impose sales tax on services. We now have sales tax on Australia Post and Telecom to name just two&mdash;an additional $320m given to government revenue. We have heard so often from the Government that the wholesale sales tax is just a small percentage of the tax paid. That is not so. Indeed, it is becoming the Government's consumption tax. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A broadly based consumption tax set at a higher rate of, say, 12 1/2 per cent&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that was the percentage that Mr Keating chose in 1985 when he was pushing a consumption tax. Honourable senators will remember that consumption tax. It was his Option C; it was the favoured option&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. provide enough revenue to enable a more generous net benefit for wage and salary earners and a more substantial increase in social security payments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. enable the existing wholesale tax to be abolished altogether.</PARA>
<PARA>We all remember that. We all remember how very keen he was on his preferred option. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's preferred option would mean a switch in the tax system, with more tax paid at the time income is spent, but less tax paid at the time income is earned. But because this will reduce the level of tax avoidance and evasion, and because many of the ways income tax is avoided will be directly removed by new laws, there will be bigger cuts in income tax than increases in consumption tax.</PARA>
<PARA>He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Social Security, Veterans Affairs and Education pensions and benefits will be increased to at least compensate, and often more than compensate, for the increase in the cost of living.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say that the end result would be:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. a fairer tax system with fewer tax avoiders and evaders</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. lower income taxes, so that the reward for extra effort is greater&mdash;for example for people who work overtime</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. an effective cut in total taxes for most wage and salary earners, and a larger increase in pensions and benefits than is needed to compensate for the consumption tax</PARA>
<PARA>He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. a more efficient tax system which doesn't discriminate so heavily against different products and </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">different types of investment. That will help promote economic growth</PARA>

<PARA>We agree wholeheartedly with him in what he was trying to put forward. We did not go for the 12 1/2 per cent, but we agree with his GST. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me explain just what we are doing. We are going to abolish seven taxes. Perhaps one of the most important is the wholesale sales tax. As Mr Keating said, abolish it and it will be a fairer tax. There will not be those distortions that he was referring to. So we will abolish seven taxes and replace them with a GST. Those seven taxes are: the wholesale sales tax; petrol tax; payroll tax; lump sum superannuation tax; the training guarantee levy; the customs duty levy; and the coal export duty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also said that we will freeze the superannuation levy at whatever it is when we get in, because that is just an additional tax that this Government has recently decided to put on business.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Treasury&mdash;and do not let us forget that the Government, attempting to find a loophole in our figures, went over our goods and services tax and the whole of the Fightback package very thoroughly&mdash;came up with, not a 4.4 per cent one-off cost of living increase, as we said there would be, but 3.6 per cent. But whatever it is, we are happy to stick by the 4.4 per cent, because we have been very conservative in our estimates of the cost. What we are doing in return to compensate for that 4.4 per cent is of considerable benefit to Australians generally. They will be more than compensated for that 4.4 per cent. There will be lower taxes. Indeed, someone on $25,000 will be saving $1,185&mdash;a 25.2 per cent decrease in tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be a doubling of the family allowance for those families under $30,000, and an increase in the dependent spouse rebate of $300.

There will be an incentive to save, so we will be able to afford some of our own expenditure in Australia and not have to borrow outside to finance it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will retain and improve Medicare, with subsidies for pensioners and low-income earners who want to insure privately but who will not be forced to insure privately. Pensions will be increased by 8 per cent&mdash;not 4.4 per cent, which will be the increase in the cost of living. All beneficiaries will receive their benefits with a 6 per cent increase.

We heard from some of the Government members, and indeed from the Australian Democrats earlier this evening, that small business will have a lot of paperwork to do. All I can tell them is that small business owners have welcomed it with open arms. They have been particularly keen on the goods and services tax because they recognise that, once those other taxes are taken off their backs, they will at least be able to compete and be able to export. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been told by Government members that there is no wholesale sales tax, no payroll tax on food. We have been told that there is a little bit on, say, flavoured milk and biscuits, but that food generally, things like butter, has no wholesale sales tax on it and no payroll tax because supermarkets do not pay payroll tax. Mr Keating and every Labor member who says that are totally wrong. Every product on every shelf in every shop in Australia has its price increased at every stage of its production because of Labor's hidden indirect consumption taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to give an example of what occurs with butter, because back in Hobart I had Mr Duncan Kerr tell me during one of our debates that there was no wholesale sales tax on butter and no payroll tax in a supermarket selling that butter. Let us go back to the dairy farmer who sells his butterfat to the manufacturer. The amount of payroll tax, training levy, fuel excise and wholesale sales tax that the farmer pays is unbelievable. For instance, the freight involved in getting the fertiliser from the source to the farm gate is enormous, and under the coalition government the cost of the fuel alone will be 26c a litre cheaper. The wholesale sales tax will not be on the vehicles, on the tyres, on the spare parts, on the oil, et cetera. From the freight paid in getting the various items that the dairy farmer requires onto his property, the payroll tax, training levy, fuel excise and wholesale sales tax will be removed. None of the items that the farmer uses in production will bear those costs. I will stick to fertiliser for just a moment longer. The EZ Company in Hobart already pays $3.4m payroll tax. When that goes, when the freight goes and when the wholesale tax goes on that particular company, then it will be able to sell its fertiliser cheaper and so the farmer will get his fertiliser at a cheaper rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then the dairy farmer sells his butterfat to the milk processor. The carrier takes the butterfat to the milk processor or to the butter factory. That carrier now pays 26c a litre less for the fuel. The motor vehicle will not have wholesale sales tax on it, nor will the vehicle parts. The fuel and oil and lubricants, the cleaning materials and the solvents, the office equipment and supplies, the accountant and all the professional costs, the postage and the telephone, the local council rates&mdash;all of those will be free of goods and services tax. Under the present system they carry payroll tax, the training levy, fuel excise and wholesale sales tax. So the transport of the butterfat to the butter factory will be so much cheaper. The butter factory will not be paying the payroll tax under our system, it will not be paying wholesale sales tax, and it will not be paying the training levy or the fuel excise, so the butter will be produced so much more cheaply at the butter factory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is then carried once again to the wholesaler, and again we have the reduction in freight costs. We then have the food wholesaler, who again will not be paying payroll tax, and who again will not be paying wholesale sales tax or fuel excise or the training levy. So we come once again to the carrier to bring it to the supermarket, and so the chain goes on. To say there is no wholesale sales tax, payroll tax, training levy or fuel excise on butter is untrue. It is on every single stage in the production of that butter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think everyone accepts the fact that the whole system of sales tax legislation is an incredible mess. I have not heard anyone on the Government side defend the present sales tax system. In fact, the legislation we have before us tonight is an incompetent and disastrous attempt to correct the chaotic mess that is sales tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The attempts to fix this mess started back in the August Budget of 1990. That is when it was announced that they would try to fix this mess, a mess which has resulted in many honest business people in Australia being stood over and blackmailed by various elements&mdash;acting without authority I hope&mdash;in the Tax Office. This involves deals which are essentially disgraceful and which are forcing small businesses in many instances to come to settlements with the Tax Office because the cost of contesting Tax Office determinations about areas of sales tax which are open to dispute is intolerably high. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the submissions made on many occasions to my office by small business people are correct, the behaviour of some tax officers in this respect has been appalling. Within the framework of the sales tax legislation, there is apparently the capacity for inspectors to come and say to a small printer, `The wrong sales tax rate has been charged on these individual jobs'. This is because the sales tax system is so confusing and ludicrous. It is such a bad tax that there is enormous scope for disagreement about what sales tax should be applied in specific instances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One printer might face the problem of deciding which of three sales tax rates he or she should apply. If the tax inspector disagrees with the interpretation taken by the printer at the time, there is a scenario that develops which I will outline, from examples of things that have actually happened in my area of Wollongong to people who come to tell me about them. The inspector comes and, after looking at the books, says, `You have wrongly charged these particular items, you owe us $20,000'. The little printer says, `I don't think I have. I think I have charged the right one and, in any event, if you hit me with a $20,000 bill I cannot pay I will go out of business. I will go broke'. The situation then is that the little printer says, `I will just have to fight you. I will appeal. I will do whatever I can'. It is pointed out to him that his prospects of winning may well not be great and that an appeal will cost him a lot of money. In fact, if he spends all that money in fighting these sorts of matters, that cost could ultimately end up being added to his losses if he does not win the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The man from the Tax Office leaves him to think about it. A little while later the tax people come back to him and say, `What are you going to do?'. He says, `I cannot pay. I will have to fight to try to stay alive, even though I cannot afford it'. Then the tax people offer him an opportunity and say, `If you pay the Tax Office $10,000, we will say that is it and everything is all right'. In other words, the little printer has the opportunity of settling, even though he claims he has not made a mistake, that he has not undercharged, and that he has not defrauded the Tax Office. He then has the opportunity of paying 10 grand and being saved from the prospect of being sent broke. Maybe that is commercial reality, maybe that is the way things should go. There are others who see it as an uncomplicated sort of standover device, whereby the people who are right, in their view, are simply terrorised out of defending their rights because of the enormous costs of doing so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A tax system that allows or even encourages that kind of thing is simply not acceptable. There appears to be some recognition in lots of other areas that this tax system is unacceptable. We have had&mdash;and we are supposed to be debating it&mdash;a simplification review that was first announced in August 1990 and on which so much work apparently was done that it was only on 2 April this year that the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) announced, in a press release, the results of that review. By 26 May 1992, almost two years after the initial announcement, the results of this enormous gestation were produced. It was a very sickly child: it was so sick that it had to have almost all its limbs amputated and replaced. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts, of course, are not very comfortable for many people in the Labor Party.

Of course, we know that that is not true; it is $50,000, and was increased some months ago. It also says that returns must be submitted regularly&mdash;usually six per year for sporting clubs. For heaven's sake, the great bulk of sporting clubs would not have turnovers of over $250,000. Most of them would not have turnovers of over $50,000. If their turnovers, under the proposed GST, are above $50,000 and below $250,000, they have to put in only two a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That sort of straight dishonesty is what one, I suppose, would expect from a government in such disarray. In any event, the key point is that the GST removes this whole structure&mdash;a disgraceful and incompetent structure&mdash;of sales tax which is volumes in length. It is a huge set. I think there are something like 27 Acts relating to sales tax which are reviewed in these six Bills. The GST gets rid of that whole structure, that whole mess, which this Government has just demonstrated that it is too incompetent to fix up properly, anyway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been interesting to see the nature of the attack on Fightback as it affects sport. Of course, apart from the fact that the GST gets rid of sales tax, which seriously hits sport at the moment, I will just mention in passing some of those things that the Government's document sent to sporting clubs carefully avoids. The facts are that the Government charges heavy taxes on sport. For example, it imposes 20 per cent sales tax on sports programs, on soaps, on detergents, on antiseptics, on Dencorub, on sponges, on buckets, on toilet paper, on writing and wrapping paper, on mowers and on tractors. Of course, there is a 10 per cent sales tax on soft drinks, fruit juices, ice-creams, snack foods, medallions&mdash;and even trophies awarded for sport. </PARA>

Apart from the fact that under Fightback the present 20 per cent sales tax on sporting goods&mdash;which costs sports people $240m a year but is not mentioned in the Government's statement about how terrible GST is going to be for sport; we could not expect a bit of honesty from the Government&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A sporting club is in the business of providing a service. It gets a sponsorship from a corporation or a business. The corporation which sponsors it, clearly, is paying for a `service'. That GST paid by the sponsoring organisation is a taxed input, for which it receives full refund. Business inputs are totally refundable. Everyone in this chamber would know that. The Government is recklessly indifferent to the facts and sends out dishonest propaganda. I suppose it can live with that; it has been living with that kind of thing for some time. But this is the nature of the basic dishonesty of the Government's approach.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, sporting clubs buying advertising space will have whatever GST they pay fully refunded. If they sell advertising or media or catering rights, or accept sponsorships, there will be no net cost difference. All the GST they are charged will be totally refunded to the buyer or sponsor, so sponsorships will not be adversely affected by the GST. Donations are free of GST and government grants are free of GST. On top of all this sort of thing, the cut of 26c per litre in fuel prices to sporting clubs and transport companies will mean a major reduction in the costs of attending competition for clubs, members and spectators. Any GST on accommodation or transport paid for by clubs will be totally refundable to the club. Yet we keep on hearing this dishonest rubbish from the Government about the disastrous effect on sport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that, as a result of Fightback, sporting clubs will be much cheaper to run, because all these sales taxes will be removed, while all GST paid by clubs will be totally refunded and grants and donations to the clubs will be free of GST. While some things will clearly be cheaper, such as running a sporting club and transport to games, some things will be dearer, such as memberships and spectators' fees. We have got to accept that. But overall, if there is any increase in the cost of participation in or watching sport, it will be more than compensated for by the 30 per cent cut in Australians' income taxes and the accompanying 8 per cent rise in pensions, which is one of the main purposes for introducing the GST. Sport will clearly prosper under a Hewson government, particularly as the generation of two million or so extra jobs under Fightback will provide significantly increased opportunities for those Australians who are presently too hobbled by unemployment and the recession to participate in the sport of their choice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to support very strongly the amendment moved by my colleague Senator Baume. It is an amendment to the second reading motion, namely:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Omit all words after `That', substitute:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) the bills, together with the circulated amendments, be referred to the Select Committee on Sales Tax Legislation, for examination and report by 6 October 1992;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) that Committee be established with the composition and powers provided by paragraphs (2) to (9), inclusive, of the order of the Senate of 25 June 1992 and with the membership appointed on that day.</PARA>
<PARA>The Senate Select Committee was established by the Senate on 25 June to examine the Bills. The coalition is moving that because of their significant nature, the amendments that have been circulated, as well as the Bills, be considered in the Committee; because that has not been able to be done up to date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate may recall the history of this matter over the last few months. The Government, after an almost two-year review of the sales tax legislation, produced in April a so-called simplification of the existing sales tax regime. It was said that this simplification exercise and the results of it represented the most significant change in sales tax legislation since sales tax was first introduced in 1930. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the alleged significance of those changes, given that the Bills had in the dying days of the autumn sittings been guillotined in the most brutal fashion through the House of Representatives without any consideration, without any substantive debate, this Senate in its wisdom decided to create a Senate select committee to examine the Bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That Select Committee was given an impossibly tight timetable in which to do its work. It was established at the end of June with a requirement that it report back to the Senate on the second day of the Budget sittings, 19 August. Senators Vanstone and I represented the coalition on that Committee, there were three Government senators and there was Senator Kernot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We received no less than 150 submissions expressing concern about all or parts of that legislation. We were scheduled to meet in public hearings on 12 and 13 August to hear at least some of those 150 submissions&mdash;a minuscule proportion of them, I must say. Because of that impossibly tight timetable, many of those submissions were incapable of being given any hearing at all by the Select Committee. Nevertheless, we were prepared to go ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At 6.00 p.m. on the night of 11 August, the night before the Committee was due to have its public hearings on the submissions we had received, which, of course, were based on the Bills as presented in the Senate, the Treasurer put out a very skinny three-page press release in which he announced that the Government had decided to make several changes to the proposed sales tax Bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those several changes amounted, in fact, to a whole raft of proposals to amend six key areas of the Government's sales tax proposals. These were key areas that the Government said were essential to effect a proper simplification. But so hasty were these amendments and these proposals that the Government did not have any amendments available to the Committee to consider when it was taking its hearings on the following two days and preparing its report in the three or four days after that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what the Government in fact did was take two years to do a so-called simplification exercise, bring it into the Parliament in May and jackboot it, with the use of the guillotine, through the House of Representatives. It attempted to do the same here in the Senate. Fortunately, the Democrats supported the coalition on the establishment of the Select Committee to which I have referred. Then, with all that work having been done ostensibly by the Tax Office, two years' solid consideration, so we were told, the Government, out of the blue, on the night before the Select Committee was due to take its hearings, announced major changes to no less than six key areas of its own proposals, but without one word of drafted amendment to show the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the Committee hearings on the ensuing two days officers of the Australian Taxation Office were mightily embarrassed by the situation that they were placed in. It was a deliberate and blatant political ploy by the Government, and I dissociate the Tax Office officers from involvement in this ploy; they were the pawns in the game. It was a deliberate political ploy by the Government to completely undermine the work of the Senate Select Committee and, in effect, undermine the work that the Tax Office had done in the preceding two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of the Treasurer's announcement was to throw the work of the Select Committee into total confusion. We did the best that we could and, in the circumstance, I would have to say, we did a pretty good job. But it was a job that was impossible to be done properly because the Government did not have available for the Committee the necessary drafting of the amendments that had been foreshadowed in the Treasurer's belated, last minute press release. As a result of all of that, the Committee produced a report which is less than fully adequate. It was always going to be inadequate because of the impossible time pressure that was put on it by the Government&mdash;with, I must say, regrettably, the conniving agreement of the Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was always going to be a less than fully adequate job. This absolutely guaranteed that it would be an inadequate job. As a result, the Senate is now being asked by the Government to debate and pass a package of legislation which is totally different from the legislation that it introduced into this place. It has totally emasculated the work that, it said, was essential to achieve the simplification of the sales tax system that it claimed was so essential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that the wholesale sales tax regime in this country is archaic, anomaly ridden, inefficient and unfair. We on this side say that there is no way, with a wholesale sales tax system, that we can ever correct those problems. The only way that we can get a fair, equitable and efficient indirect tax regime is to introduce a tax of the nature of the goods and services tax that the coalition is proposing. That is why it is so vitally important that this legislation be properly debated and properly scrutinised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Government has got in this legislation is, in fact, its version of a Clayton's GST. It sees this legislation, this package, as being the answer to the need for a GST. We totally reject that. But what we will not abide is the passage through this chamber and through this Parliament of legislation which is obviously a botched job. This legislation, whilst in some areas it will improve the existing sales tax regime, in other areas will simply add to the complexity and the confusion of the sales tax system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that this legislation produces a set of six sales tax Acts to replace the existing 27 or so Acts does not in itself constitute simplification of the system. The wholesale sales tax system is complex because of its inherent nature. It is complex, confusing and inequitable because it has multi-rates. This legislation does not at all attempt to address that. There are five rates in the existing wholesale sales tax regime. After the simplification process, there will still be five rates. The other complexity with the wholesale sales tax is that there is a whole series of exemptions. Because there are exemptions in the system, there are problems of classifying items as to what rate they are going to be subjected to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation does not tackle, and it does not even try to tackle, that fundamental problem of exemptions and classifications. So, far from having a simplified system, we have nothing of the sort. We now have a half-baked, emasculated system. In many ways, it is more complex and more confusing than the system that it is designed to replace. Amendments have been circulating since the Senate resumed in Budget week. I am not sure whether they have been formally circulated in this chamber, but there are some copies floating around; I did not get a copy of them from this chamber. Perhaps Senator McMullan might enlighten us to whether they have been formally circulated in this chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us wait and see what happens. If these amendments have not been circulated formally in the chamber, it compounds the felony of which I have been speaking. The idea that this Government can jackboot the proper parliamentary processes is absolutely incredible. It did it in the House of Representatives, and it tried to do it in the Senate. We at least stopped the Government part way and forced it to have a select committee, over its dead body. Now the Government is trying to outsit the Senate by getting it to sit ridiculous hours, absolutely killer hours of the night and early morning, to pass this legislation, and Senator McMullan, as the person responsible for the Bill, does not even know whether amendments to it have been circulated. Talk about gross incompetence!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McMullan gets up and rails at the coalition, in terms of trying to get order and decency in the Senate, yet his ability, and the Government's ability, to manage business in the Parliament is just lamentable. That is the reason why the coalition is moving this amendment to refer the Bills and the amendments, if they are available, back to the Senate Select Committee, which was given the job, by the Senate, to do a proper scrutiny and examination of the legislation that this Senate is supposed to pass. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That Select Committee was not able to do its work, because the amendments were not available. I believe, and the coalition is of the strongest view, that it is absolutely incumbent upon the Government, in the interests of proper parliamentary process, that the Senate be given the proper opportunity to properly scrutinise this raft of major amendments that have been circulated, or of which circulation has been foreshadowed. I do not know whether they are formal amendments, but certainly some of the ones I have seen bear no resemblance to what the Select Committee was told they would look like. For example, the Select Committee was told that the general anti-avoidance provisions were to be significantly redrafted. I do not think that that was one of the six areas where the Government, including the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), said there would be amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But in the debate in the Select Committee, there was a considerable amount of discussion about the notorious clause 92(2) of the Bill, which relates to avoidance schemes. For the benefit of the Senate I might just remind them of what clause 92(2) said. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the purpose of cancelling a tax benefit, the Commissioner may, in the assessment, determine all or any of the following:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a)that particular things are to be treated as not having happened;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b)that particular things are to be treated as having been done by a different person or to have happened at a different time;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(ii) to have happened at a particular time.</PARA>
<PARA>That is absolutely Orwellian language. If my memory serves me correctly, we were told by the Tax Office during the Senate Select Committee hearings&mdash;because it was raised so strongly by the coalition members and by numerous witnesses&mdash;that that would be changed. That was my understanding. Now in the amendments that I have before me all this has been changed, so we are told. What do I find when I come and read the new section? What has happened is that clause 92(2) has become clause 93A. Clause 93A(2) says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"(2)  The Commissioner may, in the assessment, do all or any of the following:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(ii)to have happened at a particular time.</PARA>
<PARA>With the exception of the insertion of the words `for the purpose of cancelling the tax benefit', which was always obvious in the first draft, that section is no different from the previous section 92(2). Yet we were told in the Select Committee, if my recall is accurate, that that would be changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole problem with the Select Committee was that we had to take the Tax Office and the Government on trust because we did not have the words in front of us. Now we have the words in front of us and they do not always coincide with what the Government and the Tax Office said was going to be the content of the amendments. That is just one example&mdash;it is one of the more drastic ones. But in the absence of putting all this back to a committee for proper examination, we are never going to verify the undertakings and the changes announced by the Treasurer in his press statement on 11 August&mdash;and that skinny three-page paper was the only bit of paper on which the Select Committee was able to base its discussion in the two days of very detailed hearings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we do not, on this side, move this amendment lightly. We move this amendment because it is of the greatest importance to the taxpayers of Australia, who have been battered by this Government in the area of taxation at all levels in the&mdash;heaven forbid&mdash;10 years that this Government has been in office, in which time there have been 104 new taxes or increased variations to existing taxes. That is, in effect, 104 new taxes in the past 9 1/2 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wholesale sales tax is a very important part of the tax system. We demand that this Parliament not be overridden by executive fiat, which is what the Government is proposing to do. We demand that this Parliament be allowed to do what the parliaments in any free, democratic society are supposed to do&mdash;to do its job in looking at the proposals of the Executive in a thorough way so that the interests of the people of Australia can be fully protected. Unless this amendment is agreed to, that simply will not be able to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has very deliberately put a tight reporting time in the amendment. We are asking that the Committee do its work and report back to the Parliament on 6 October, which is the first day of the next sitting week. So any suggestion that the coalition is trying to stretch this matter out is totally unfounded, as evidenced by that very tight timetable we are imposing. It is essential that this matter be given full consideration. As I said at an earlier stage, what we are talking about now is the Government's proposal to amend its unworkable, archaic, inefficient indirect tax system in a futile and blatant political attempt to have a satisfactory alternative to the goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that the people of Australia, particularly those who have suffered at such cost through the inequities of the existing wholesale sales tax regime, will see through that.

I rise to support the amendment moved by my colleague Senator Michael Baume to refer the sales tax legislation back to the Senate Select Committee on Sales Tax Legislation which examined the legislation in the first place. The changes announced by the Government have been so far-reaching as to fundamentally change the character of the legislation. Furthermore, undertakings given at that Senate Select Committee have not been fully honoured in the amendments we have before us. Indeed, Senator Short was quite right in expecting further amendments in order that those commitments be fully honoured. So he was quite right in raising the question: where are all the amendments?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that certain areas are addressed by this legislation. We thank the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) for that. In terms of the issues that have been put to the Parliamentary Secretary and the Australian Taxation Office and subsequently by people who have been disadvantaged, these amendments do not go nearly far enough to satisfy the problems outlined at the Senate Select Committee. We believe that, if the Government gave an undertaking, by virtue of the tax simplification legislation, to bring about a certain outcome and then changed its mind, that undertaking should be honoured in some way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the situation whereby the two Australian oil companies&mdash;the small ones, Ampol and Caltex&mdash;have a greater exposure to sales tax as a result of the backtracking by the Government than they would have under the original simplification proposals. We were expecting a government amendment and, given that that is not forthcoming, I think we are entitled to a full and appropriate explanation. There are other areas&mdash;there are concerns about X(3) arrangements and perhaps 20 others&mdash;which I will not enumerate at the present time, but I will ask for further evaluation and reasons if we proceed to the committee stage. The preferable route would be to have the tax officers, together with witnesses who could be disadvantaged as a result of this legislation, before us in the forum of a select committee to ensure the passage of appropriate and correct legislation. A lot of time has been spent on this. I believe a few more weeks are needed to get it into a better form.

First of all, I will deal with some formal matters that I need to put on the record in the conclusion of this second reading debate.

The proposed business inputs exemption for a person who supplies material to be made up into goods will be extended. The exemption will now be allowed if the made-up goods are for wholesale sale and/or indirect marketing sale by the supplier. The original amendments did not allow the exemption if the goods were for indirect marketing sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second amendment is to the Sales Tax Amendment (Transitional) Bill. This amendment will insert a new credit ground&mdash;CR5A&mdash;to allow people a credit if they apply tax paid goods to their own use in circumstances that satisfy one of the three proposed new exemption items dealing with exempt end users. These exemption items will allow for exemption for goods that are donated to always-exempt bodies, incorporated into other goods that are for use by a person in exempt circumstances, or incorporated into property owned by or leased to an always-exempt body.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that I wish formally to refer to in the summing up, before I deal with some of the things that were said in the second reading, relates to the general anti-avoidance provisions. The Government has been asked to clarify whether the general anti-avoidance provision will apply to ordinary commercial arrangements. The answer is that it will not. However, as these words are inexact in legal terms, and their scope is uncertain, the new provision&mdash;like its counterpart in the income tax law&mdash;is designed to apply where, on an objective view of the particular arrangement and its surrounding circumstances, it would be concluded that the arrangement was entered into for the sole or dominant purpose of obtaining a tax benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been a number of statements made in the course of this debate that are just clearly wrong. Senator Crowley dealt with a large number of them and, given the hour, I will not repeat them. Several honourable senators have described the new legislation as a revenue grab, and someone even said that the new legislation will result in a revenue gain of $91m. That seems, to me, a case of `think of a figure and double it', because this is quite clearly incorrect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the new legislation is estimated to raise an additional $28m in a full year, that amount is mainly attributable to one measure, designed to stamp out tax evasion. This anti-evasion measure, originally announced by the Fraser Government but not implemented by it, will impose a liability on taxpayers who falsely claim exemption. As this measure is to raise an additional $52m in a full year, the real impact of the remainder of the new measures is a cost to the Government of $24m. We have also had the old furphy about half a million more taxpayers, when everybody knows that that is not the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had concern expressed about the number of amendments required to be made to these Bills. It is always the case that every tax Bill needs constant review. For example, the New Zealand GST legislation has been amended: there have been 22 separate Bills in the New Zealand Parliament to amend the New Zealand GST since it was introduced. If honourable senators would like a list of them, I am happy to make that available. There has never been a tax Bill that has not required amendment: that certainly has never been the case with a GST anywhere, including the Opposition's favourite model, New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had people asserting that all sorts of wonderful things are taxable under the wholesale sales tax. Senator Knowles, under the things which she asserted apart from those which Senator Crowley dealt with, wanted to say that stethoscopes, for example, were taxable&mdash;when quite clearly they are exempt now, and that exemption will continue in the new law. Senator Knowles wanted to claim that hot water tanks would become taxable under the new law&mdash;when, in fact, there is no change to their taxable situation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Brownhill actually said it on page 657 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 9 September 1992, so his memory is failing him. Maybe someone else wrote the speech and he just read it and forgot that he had said it. So there are a large number of assertions. I do not want to go through all of them. I just used those as a few examples to show that people throw around assertions with a little more enthusiasm than the analysis would justify. Those things are very clear.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do get, however, all this passion about the fact&mdash;and it is reflected, for example, in the minority report signed by Senators Short and Vanstone, and that came out in the speeches of a number of people&mdash;that there are problems in the wholesale sales tax, because it requires classification; because there are different rates and some things are exempt. Of course, that is true. Every tax that has any differentiation has, within it, problems of boundaries, definitions and classifications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That fact is true about the wholesale sales tax, as it is true about the goods and services tax. The Opposition does not seem to realise that it actually has three classifications: zero, exempt and taxable. As Price Waterhouse said in its Fightback analysis document, `The quagmire is dead; long live the quagmire!'. It is talking about the fact that these distortions will not go away with the passing of the wholesale sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's GST proposal is far from a distortion free tax, nor will it be without its quota of administrative complications and definitional issues. These issues are just as much a source of complexity, dispute and litigation as any other form of taxation. Since the introduction of the GST in New Zealand five years ago, there have been more than 100 GST cases before the courts. This is as many as there have been Australian wholesale sales tax cases in its 60-year history. This is this wonderful, clear, simple, straightforward, uncomplicated piece of legislation that is a lawyer's and an accountant's bonanza. No wonder lawyers and accountants support it&mdash;just as honourable senators opposite all support it because the biggest compensation in the income tax flows to people on just about a back bench salary. That is where the highest percentage increase in after tax earnings falls; it falls on people on $75,000 a year. No wonder the proposal got applause in the Opposition party room. All sorts of complications result from it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not at this time start to go through what Price Waterhouse links to this wonderful proposal&mdash;all the complications, all the problems with the definitions and grey areas and all the complexities, boundaries and classification issues that are going to arise. They arise under every tax proposal because every tax has to have definitions, boundaries and classifications; they become the subject of dispute, litigation, and accountants' and lawyers' fees proliferate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Price Waterhouse went on to say&mdash;it is on page 8 of the document&mdash;that there are great problems of definition, that there will be a measure of complexity and that dispute will be unavoidable. Of course, it pursues the question of health that honourable senators opposite have been ducking and diving to avoid recently. Those prescription based drugs and medicines that are on the PBS are going to be zero rated. But what about the other three schedules? Where are they all going to fit? They are in what Price Waterhouse calls the `grey zone'. When does a service provided by a hospital cease to be a health care service? At what stage does a service or other facility supplied by a school cease to be an educational service? If goods supplied by State governments, authorities and enterprises are sheltered from the GST under the Constitution&mdash;which it is arguable they might be&mdash;will this lead to significant distortions of competition? What, for example, will be the treatment of financial services that are supplied incidental to another business? If they are to be exempt, then how will the import tax portion be calculated? If they are to be taxed, how will competitive distortion be avoided? At what point does an exempt financial service become a secondary financial service? There will also be problems with timing rules and the issues of definition that arise particularly for the construction industry, which has been making its concerns very explicit, as has the tourist industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are some of the reasons why the Opposition has had those 300 submissions to the Cole committee that it will not release. There have been three reports from the Cole committee which express how the Opposition should go about doing this in a different way and which the Opposition will not release because it does not want anybody to know what its own hired experts think is wrong with the proposal. The Opposition is just trying to hang on in the hope that these concerns and problems will not come out before the election. I have to say that I think that is a wish that will not be fulfilled. Ernst and Young and Price Waterhouse have expressed concerns about the impact of the Opposition proposals on the tourist industry. As I have said, they are concerns expressed by the construction industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But for all those economic and administrative problems with the goods and services tax, the fundamental problem is  that it is just unfair. People just have to look at what is cheaper, compared with what gets more expensive. It becomes readily apparent what the priorities are and who wins and who loses. People should have a look at what is cheaper. Luxury cars, jewellery and fur coats are cheaper. Food, clothing and electricity are more expensive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Look at what the coalition has chosen to zero rate, compared with what it has chosen to make taxable. Overseas holidays are zero rated, private school fees are zero rated, private health fund contributions are zero rated, but what about food, clothing and electricity? They are taxable. This is a wonderful statement of its priorities for which we are duly grateful. And then, to compensate for this unfair tax, we have an unfair tax compensation package where those on $75,000 get an increase in after tax income of 14.7 per cent and those on average weekly earnings get only 7 per cent. So we get double&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am just enjoying the opportunity to discuss the GST. I thank the Opposition for raising it; it is very kind of it. Even at this late hour it is great fun to have the opportunity to debate that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been a whole lot of misleading things said about the wholesale sales tax. I want to respond to something that Senator Michael Baume said. I interjected on him to indicate that his facts were wrong, so I should back that up. That was not a source of contention between him and me at that point but I want to put the facts on the record. I am advised that theatrical props made for own use by theatre companies&mdash;he was referring to the Australian Ballet&mdash;are not now taxable and it has never been proposed that they would be. There was a misunderstanding by some advisers who thought that was the case. There was a decision, the Nimrod decision, back in the early 1980s. Senator Baume referred to the attempt by the Government to tax those things. I am almost certain that the proposal to impose wholesale sales tax on the theatre props produced by Nimrod commenced before the election of this Government. I am almost certain that was a Fraser Government initiative before 1983. But I do want to clarify the fact that those arts matters about which he raised concern are in fact not a legitimate ground of concern; the problem does not arise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be plenty of opportunities to have exciting debates about the relative merits of the wholesale sales tax and the goods and services tax. People have been going on at length about how prices will only go up by 4 per cent, before we look at the road user charges, which is another issue. They keep pretending that food will not go up by 8.8 per cent or fresh fruit and vegetables by 10 or clothing by 11. These are the things that people have to buy every day and they are going to get more expensive every time. That is why it is so unfair, that is why people are so concerned about it. That is why we are proposing to simplify the wholesale sales tax system, as this proposal quite self-evidently does. We aim to streamline its administration, to improve its operation to make it more certain, and to reduce the administrative cost to government and the compliance cost to business. These things will be achieved by the amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We clearly are not going to agree to the second reading amendment moved by Senator Baume. That is quite clearly just another delaying tactic. This has already been to the Committee, and the Senate has a capacity to deal with amendments which were circulated four weeks ago. It is called the committee stage and that is what we should be doing as soon as possible. I will indicate the amendments with which we will be agreeing during the committee stage; it is a waste of time to do so now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to conclude by reiterating three things. Firstly, I thank the officers of the Tax Office and the Treasury who have over the last two years put an enormous amount of work into this package of legislation, which is a very important package and a very significant improvement in our tax system. Even if one would prefer a GST, an honest assessment must lead to the conclusion that this is a substantial improvement, even if not that which one would prefer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I want to say that this package of legislation needs to be passed by this Senate and needs to be passed quickly, which is why we are sitting at this obnoxious hour. Many people have chosen to make long and repetitive speeches. I think it was called tedious repetition slightly earlier in the day and we have certainly had our quota of that this evening. But it is an important package of legislation which the Parliament should get on and pass as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, it is very important that this Parliament takes the opportunity from time to time to say that the wholesale sales tax has superiority over the goods and services tax, that it has the capacity to distinguish between necessities and luxuries, that it has the capacity to distinguish between environmentally beneficial and environmentally damaging products, and that it has the capacity to, and does, distinguish between necessities and luxuries, and it is therefore inherently fairer and more in the long term interests of this nation. That is why we are seeking to improve it rather than to throw it out and introduce a new and unfair tax. Therefore, I urge&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Agreement Between the Government of Australia and the Government of Japan for the Protection of Migratory Birds and Birds in Danger of Extinction and their Environment was signed on 6 February 1974. The Agreement Between the Government of Australia and the Government of the People's Republic of China for the Protection of Migratory Birds and their Environment was signed on 20 October 1986.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Although not explicit in their texts, both Agreements apply throughout the Commonwealth of Australia, its Territories and territorial waters and are implemented through a variety of Commonwealth, State and Territory legislation. Both Migratory Birds Agreements call upon each Contracting Party to take appropriate measures to preserve and enhance the environment of migratory birds. The areas of land or sea covered by the Agreements could therefore be considered to be all those areas of land and sea which provide important breeding, feeding and roosting habitat for those species which are included in the annexes to the Agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The Port of Brisbane and the proposed area for its expansion lie within Moreton Bay. The draft Moreton Bay Strategic Plan, which shows the proposed expansion of the Port of Brisbane, was developed by the Queensland Government in consultation with the public. Some sites within Moreton Bay provide valuable habitat for species included in the annexes of the two Migratory Birds Agreements, and hence could be considered to be "areas covered by these agreements".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The waters of Moreton Bay are State waters and therefore the Government of the State of Queensland has jurisdiction over the seabed areas that will be affected by the proposed expansion of the Port of Brisbane.</PARA>
