When I advised that the exhibition would run for a week from 26 June, a number of honourable senators expressed their concern that the exhibition would not be staged while the Parliament was in session. To stage the exhibition, some works have had to be retrieved from senators' and members' offices. I have now been assured that with the cooperation of those members and senators it should be possible to start the exhibition from today.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Territories Law Reform Bill is a very important piece of constitutional legislation for this Parliament. The Opposition certainly supports and endorses the broad thrust and the principles of this legislation. However, we do have a number of important reservations that will become apparent during the course of my speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to recognise that the history of the Indian Ocean territories&mdash;that is, Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Island&mdash;has been very peculiar in the history books or the annals of Australia. The islands are the remnants of nineteenth century colonialism. They have inherited a body of law&mdash;Singaporean law&mdash;that is still with us today in its application on both Cocos (Keeling) and Christmas islands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Australia assumed responsibility for these islands in the 1950s, these laws were in place. It is a shame that nearly 40 years later we are only now addressing these very fundamental legal issues to incorporate the legal regimes of these islands and to bring them into a consistency with, and to have similar standards to, mainland Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To put it in context, it is always important to recognise that the Cocos (Keeling) and Christmas islands are relatively small in both size and population. They are so distant from the Australian mainland that they often get overlooked or forgotten in much of the contemporary discussion about Australia. They certainly are very different when we look at their geography and their particular natural attributes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Cocos (Keeling) Islands comprise 27 very beautiful islands but only two of them are populated, whereas Christmas Island is well known largely because of the phosphate mining that has taken place there over many years and which has grown into an important industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Approximately 600 people live on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and 1300 people live on Christmas Island. So, in terms of size, they could be compared with average high schools in a suburban location elsewhere in Australia. Often, in degrees of sophistication, educational standards et cetera, they are probably very similar to high schools&mdash;and also in terms of the administration. But we have a very complex net of issues that we have to address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the ethnic diversity that exists on both islands, it is important to recognise that expatriate Australian public servants constitute a minority of the populations on both islands and perform essential public service-type functions and roles. The majority ethnic groups on the islands are of Malay descent but are from different backgrounds. The people on the Cocos Islands largely went there originally for the exploitation and development of copra by the Clunies-Ross family in a past era. On Christmas Island, largely as a result of phosphate mining, the community that has developed is more recent and of both Malay descent and Chinese-Malay descent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The community of interest of both of these islands could probably be best aligned to Western Australia, because in more recent years essential services have been provided by various Western Australian agencies, particularly in the areas of health and education. The communities of Cocos and Christmas islands have been linked through air traffic with Port Hedland, Geraldton and Perth. Therefore, a community of interest has built up and has been established with Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also need to recognise that both islands are strategically very important to Australia. They are, in effect, our aircraft carriers in the Indian Ocean. There are no significant defence establishments on the islands. But because of their history in the Second World War and their importance in our regional defence planning, we must always take account of the facilities available there that would naturally be used by both the Australian Navy and the Australian Air Force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned earlier that the islands were important because of the number of people on them. Therefore, we need to be interested in job opportunities for the people who live there. We must ask this question about the island, as we do about the rest of Australia: what are the fundamentals of unemployment? In the various departmental briefing notes I have seen on this matter it is recognised that unemployment on Christmas Island is currently running at 22 per cent and that there is the potential in the near future for unemployment on Cocos Island to run to 30 per cent. Such unemployment produces very abnormal social infrastructure requirements that must be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we consider this legislation, we need to refer to the second reading speech of the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins), which contained a number of qualifications with regard to the application of the law. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be understood that while this Bill will replace the essentially Singapore based regime with a Western Australian based body of law, this regime will still be subject to modification by Ordinance under the Christmas Island Act and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act. A number of Ordinances are to come into force in conjunction with commencement of this Bill. The most important will deal with interpretation of Western Australian laws in their application to the Territories, and modification of those laws to suit the particular circumstances of the Territories. A further Ordinance will be introduced for Cocos to abolish the Trust under which land is currently held by the Cocos Council, which will enable mainland-style land dealings to take place. The abolition of the Trust in favour of freehold title has the strong support of the Cocos Community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Additional Ordinances may be required in the future as the consultation process continues and modifications are required to overcome unforeseen problems or situations peculiar to the Territories.</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister also said in his second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Non-judicial powers and duties under the applied Western Australian laws will be vested in the Commonwealth Minister administering the Christmas Island Act and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act. The Minister will be able to direct that particular powers be vested in other persons or authorities, provided they fall within a range of classes specified in this Bill. The Minister will also be able to delegate powers to such persons or authorities.</PARA>
<PARA>It is important to recognise that some 700 Western Australian Acts of Parliament will be transferred in their administration to these islands as a result of this legislation. As the Minister for the Arts and Territories (Ms Fatin) has alluded, a number of them will then be either repealed or have their operation suspended or modified in some way to their general application. This, therefore, raises the complexity of this particular issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation process has developed and evolved over the last decade as the various Federal governments have sought to move the islands to mainland standards. The Grants Commission was involved in a report on Cocos (Keeling) Islands in 1989. In 1990 the Government developed a memorandum of understanding with Cocos. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs brought down a very important report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Islands in the Sun</EMPHASIS>, on the legal regimes, to which the Government responded in March 1991. So there has been a process that has got the Parliament to the point of addressing this legislation here today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must be careful that this legislation does not then become a form of modern-day paternalism and colonialism, having regard particularly to the haste with which it is being pushed through this Parliament. This legislation was introduced in the Senate on 27 May 1992 to avoid the process of introducing it more properly in the House of Representatives where the Minister resides. The legislation should have been subjected to debate in the House of Representatives in the first place. But, in order to meet the Government's program timetable, it was brought in here on 27 May to bypass that process. It is now being put through under guillotine here today in a one-hour debate. It is then to go off, as a result of my actions, to a Senate committee for half a day next Monday for consideration of the implications of this important legislation. If the committee reports after next Monday, the legislation will then be forced under guillotine through the House of Representatives in one day next week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To anyone dealing with constitutional change, that is a totally unsatisfactory parliamentary process on such an important issue. The process has not been clearly explained or understood on Cocos (Keeling) and Christmas Islands. The time that is being given to this legislation will not correct the problems of inefficiency, particularly with regard to the administration of the islands, or properly recognise the aspirations of the residents&mdash;the Australian citizens&mdash;who live on Cocos (Keeling) and Christmas Islands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been inadequate consultation with the islanders and the interest groups. The Government and the Department may well argue that they have been talking, but it has been a very one-sided conversation. There has been plenty of paperwork&mdash;I have certainly read plenty of it&mdash;but there is no established mechanism that properly creates a consultative ideal. There is no joint consultative constitutional committee established with the residents of Cocos (Keeling) and Christmas Islands for the legislation's implementation, as was the case for self-government in the Northern Territory. There is no working party. In fact, I would call for the establishment of a joint working party on the constitutional development issues that will arise from this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that the laws of Western Australia will now apply to these islanders, it is a fact that the residents of Cocos (Keeling) Island and Christmas Island have no representation in the Parliament of Western Australia, where the bulk of their laws will be made. They are part of my electorate&mdash;the Northern Territory&mdash;for voting purposes here in this Federal Parliament. That, therefore, poses a very important and fundamental constitutional issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, we need to ask: what are the other arms of government doing? We know that the Federal budget for the administration of Cocos (Keeling) and Christmas islands is about $20m per annum. That is a large and significant vote of Federal money for 1,900 islanders in the Indian Ocean. We give something less than a $1m for the administration of Norfolk Island, which has a population approaching nearly 2,000 people and which is largely self-sufficient constitutionally, legally and financially. There are some very important issues to be addressed in the areas of budget for the administration and self-perpetuation of the bureaucracy and various government departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen in recent days a program put before the Joint Committee of Public Works. Although no public works or capital projects for Christmas Island or Cocos (Keeling) Islands were announced in the Prime Minister's One Nation statement, a week or two after the statement the Government glibly commits $37m for a five-year program and indicates that it wants to spend $132m over a 10-year period. The Government then sends the program off to the Public Works Committee without having acknowledged it whatsoever in the Prime Minister's statement. Certainly, there has been some  serious questioning of the priorities and the construction timetable for $132m of taxpayers' money. I am not saying that capital works do not need to be carried out on either Christmas Island or Cocos (Keeling) Islands, but the way in which the capital works program is being pushed with the same haste as that which is happening here to legislation is important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see the creature of the Department of Administrative Services in its usual expansionist power grab putting its tentacles out and now reaching into the Indian Ocean. We all know the inefficiencies of DAS and the way it has operated over the last few years on mainland Australia. Imagine how it is now going to approach that particular issue as it seeks to spend $132m in the Indian Ocean Territories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recently paid a visit to Christmas and Cocos (Keeling) Islands, and I particularly thank the Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Ray, for making available VIP transport for that trip. Mr Chaney, Mr Lloyd and myself were able to go as a shadow Ministry team to sit, talk to and meet with all of the community organisations and ethnic groups and a large number of people on both islands. The trip certainly related to our portfolios. We were able to take our wives, staff and a member of Dr Hewson's staff, and it was an invaluable trip. I am sure the impressions that Mr Chaney gained with regard to national parks administration and the impressions that Mr Lloyd gained with regard to primary industry, quarantine and resources issues were fundamental in lifting our understanding of local problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coincidentally, we were there at the same time as the Public Works Committee was visiting and appraising the rebuilding and construction program on Christmas Island. I am certainly looking forward to an interim report from the Public Works Committee next week in this Parliament, and it will be very interesting to pick up and reflect on the priorities established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sorts of constituency issues that arose were very fundamental and germane to this legislation: housing; housing rentals; housing purchases; land; commercial development; business corporate law support; staff changes; the implication of staff changes in areas such as marine, nursing, administrative services; asbestos replacement programs; education and health services; the application of family law; the rating that will apply to Commonwealth properties; staff transfers to various government departments; quarantine standards; stevedoring; and freight. These issues just serve to highlight much of the cynicism and suspicion about the motives of this legislation and the haste with which it is being foisted through this Parliament. I said in evidence the other day before the Public Works Committee that, to a large extent, the cart was being put before the horse. Certainly, many of the ministerial discretions that will now have to be exercised with regard to finances and legislation in that area are very questionable. Of course, we need to particularly address the issue of duplicate bureaucracies that will be built up. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Please find attached a copy of the Co-operative's comments on the legal regime that was sent to the Administrator on 14 May 1992. The Co-operative has subsequently received copies of the Impact Statements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Co-operative has not received a copy of the Territory Law Reform Bill 1992 from the Commonwealth. It did receive a copy of the Bill from you only.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The introduction of a Mainland based body of the law can only be of a positive benefit to the Territory, especially in replacing the outmoded body of law that is current for the Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The points raised in the second page of the Co-operative's letter, first paragraph, is really the crux of the Co-operative's concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of particular concern is the legal position of the ownership of land.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Council's legal rights are based upon a 1984 deed between the Commonwealth and the Council which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"To have and to hold unto the Council its successors and assigns in fee simple upon trust for the benefit, advancement and well being of the Cocos Islanders resident in the Territory on land owned by the Council".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The Council its successors and assigns will not grant demise or otherwise alienate (except by will in favour of members of their own family) the conveyed land or any part thereof without the previous sanction of the Commonwealth".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Council holds the land currently in trust for the Cocos Islanders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To set aside this trust requires either:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agreement of the majority of the persons covered by the Trust.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An Act Of Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Point (b) is the path the Commonwealth have taken to set aside the trust to transfer the land freehold to the Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The majority of the Cocos Islanders wish to be able to purchase the land, and the houses, built upon them on a freehold basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, I believe that the majority of the Cocos Islanders covered by the Trust, do not understand their current legal position under the Trust. Briefly these are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)In 1984 Cocos Islanders were staying in houses built upon land that was transferred by the Commonwealth to the Council under a trust arrangement. At no point were the Cocos Islanders occupying the houses given any legal documentation by the Council as to their rights of occupancy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)Subsequently the Home Island Building Program was to commence, funded 80% by the Commonwealth and 20% by the community. The funding of the 20% by the community was achieved by a combination of:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)The Co-operative paying rent for those houses occupied by its employees to Council up until June 30, 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2)The Council receiving direct Social Security benefits and paying only a portion to the persons entitled to and paying only a portion to the persons entitled to the benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3)After July 1, 1990 occupiers of houses paying rental direct to the Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thus the community have paid the community contribution of 20% via the Council to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As old houses were demolished and new houses were constructed under the Home Island Building Programme, upon completion of the new houses, the Commonwealth passed title to the houses to the Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The community were therefore occupying houses held under trust for them by the Council, paying the 20% contribution (which has been paid), and are still continuing to pay rental to Council which under the Act will obtain freehold title to the land and buildings which they may sell to the Cocos Islanders at a value set by them. This value may or may not reflect the contribution made by the community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although Council may have agreed to the change of ownership, I believe that no vote has been taken by the person covered by the Trust, and a majority decision obtained.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I personally believe that the Cocos Islanders are not aware of the full implications of breaking the Trust, and prior to breaking the Trust I do not believe they know the terms that will be offered to them to purchase the land and buildings on a freehold basis.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Please find enclosed copy of our submission to the Honourable Wendy Fatin MP. In summary, we are urging the Minister to delay introducing the application of the Territories Law Reform Bill for a period of 12 months.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We urge you to review the enclosed submission and support the views and requests contained therein.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. INTRODUCTION</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.1As the Minister is no doubt aware, Phosphate Resources NL is the company which carries on phosphate mining on Christmas Island. Phosphate Resources NL acquired the rights to carry on that business as a result of the acquisition of a mining lease by tender from the Commonwealth Government pursuant to a Lease Agreement dated 26 September 1990. That lease gives Phosphate  Resources NL the right to mine the phosphate reserves situated on Christmas Island for a period of ten years commencing from 26 September 1990, with an option of extension for a further period of ten years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.2On 22 September 1988 the then Attorney-General requested that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs conduct an enquiry into the legal regime of Australia's external territories, which of course included the Territory of Christmas Island. The report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee and its recommendations were subsequently issued in March 1991. That report, under the heading "Islands in the Sun" made a number of recommendations and was particularly damning of the human rights abuses which had occurred on Christmas Island (refer paragraph 3.6.22). A copy of the 12 recommendations made by the Committee in relation to Christmas Island is annexed to this submission as Annexure "A". It is the submission of Phosphate Resources NL that the Territories Law Reform Bill and its manner of introduction and implementation ignores many of these recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.3Phosphate Resources NL refers to its meeting with the Minister on 22 May 1992 at Rockingham. During that visit, Mr Peter Huston, on behalf of Phosphate Resources NL, in conjunction with Mr Lai Ah Hong, who attended on behalf of the Union of Christmas Island Workers, raised a number of concerns in connection with the proposed introduction of the Territories Law Reform Bill 1992 and in particular the undue haste with which the law of Western Australia was being introduced to Christmas Island.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.4Those concerns which have been repeatedly voiced by Phosphate Resources NL and which were reiterated at our meeting on 22 May 1992 were in summary as follows:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.5Thank you for your letter dated 3 June 1992 which refers to some of the issues summarised above. Unfortunately however, the proposals contained in your letter do not alleviate or overcome the substantial concerns and problems associated with the introduction of the proposed new legal regime on Christmas Island which are identified in this submission. Much of the information as set out in your letter of 3 June 1992 is also contained in your second reading speech and in our view fails to recognise the fact that the Territories Law Reform Bill is being introduced without sufficient participation or consultation with, advice to, and education of, the people on Christmas Island.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.6It should be clearly understood however that Phosphate Resources NL is not opposed to the introduction of Western Australian law to Christmas Island in conjunction with a reform of the existing legal regime. There is no doubt, as identified in the Islands in the Sun Report that the existing system of law needs to be modified and reformed. However, that process of modification and reform needs to be carried out in a refined, phased and planned manner by the selective introduction of Western Australian laws which have been identified as being necessary or appropriate after a process of review, consultation and education. A totally new system of law should not be introduced by the wholesale application of some 700 acts and a whole body of common law without any proper or adequate explanation, review or education.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.7In summary, it must be recognised that it is unreasonable and indeed impossible to introduce over 90 years of legislature and common law in a nine month period. It certainly is impossible to do so and expect the people of Christmas Island to properly understand those laws.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.8For the purposes of this submission, it should of course be noted that the shareholders of Phosphate Resources NL comprise in excess of 300 small and large investors, all of whom are residents of Christmas Island and members of the Union of Christmas Island Workers. The views expressed in this submission thus relate not only to the commercial, but also to the social, concerns of the company. Phosphate Resources NL recognises that it has a substantial social responsibility to its shareholders in addition to its business objectives. That responsibility is reflected in the views and submissions expressed herein.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.THE UNDUE HASTE WITH WHICH THE NEW LAW IS BEING INTRODUCED</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.1The Islands in the Sun Report recommended that the law of Western Australia should be extended to Christmas Island. This recommendation was accompanied by a strongly held view of the House of Representatives Standing Committee that the law needed to be introduced in a manner which recognised the needs of the people of Christmas Island (refer paragraph 3.10.12). Unfortunately and primarily because there has been undue and unnecessary haste in the introduction and application of the Territories Law Reform Bill, there has been no proper or adequate consultation with the people of Christmas Island in relation to that proposed introduction, application and operation of this new body of law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.2It was only in late September 1991 that the decision was made for the new law to be introduced. For some reason (which was never discussed with the residents of Christmas Island) it was decided that the law needed to be operative on Christmas Island by 1 July 1992. This provided less than nine months for the residents of Christmas Island, including of course Phosphate Resources NL, to understand the concepts of the proposed new legal regime. Similarly, this only provided a short period of time for the various Commonwealth and State Government departments, agencies and instrumentalities to analyse and review the totality of the laws of Western Australia and to commence work on the best method by which those new laws should be introduced and implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.3There are in excess of 700 statutes in Western Australia. Despite the best efforts of the Australian Government Solicitor, Attorney-General's Department and all other parties, it is simply an impossible task to review and analyse all or even a major component of these items of legislation to determine their potential impact on Christmas Island and its people within a nine month period. It can take more than nine months for many individual acts to be reviewed and analysed before they are introduced into other States or Territories or to the Commonwealth. It is insensitive to believe that the whole of the legislative and common law regime of Western Australia can be reviewed, analysed, investigated and implemented within a nine month period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.4Furthermore, this unreasonable and unnecessary haste means that it has been impossible for proper consideration to be given to the requirement for the implementation of the Western Australian legal regime to be adapted to the special needs of Christmas Island residents (including Phosphate Resources NL) as was emphasised to the House of Representatives Standing Committee. We respectfully refer the Minister to Recommendation 3.10.6 of the Islands in the Sun Report where it was indicated that "the laws needed to be introduced selectively and in line with the culture of the Island". The wholesale introduction and application of the Western Australian law does not involve any adaptation or selective implementation of the law and ignores the needs and rights of the Christmas Island people. Such wholesale introduction is also at odds with the conclusions of the House of Representatives Standing Committee that the Western Australian law should be adopted in a manner which takes account of local practices, history, customs and traditions (refer paragraph 3.10.12).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.THE LACK OF CONSULTATION, EDUCATION AND ADVICE WITH, OF AND TO THE RESIDENTS OF CHRISTMAS ISLAND IN RELATION TO THE PROPOSED NEW LAW</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.1In paragraph 3.10.14 of The Islands in the Sun Report, the House of Representatives Standing Committee endorsed the view that it was vital for the Christmas Island community to be involved in the reviewing process in the application of the Western Australian law on Christmas Island. Recommendation 6 (paragraph 3.10.18) of the Report stated that it was important to ensure that the application of Western Australian laws was implemented in a way which did not adversely affect the circumstances of Christmas Island or its residents and that a reviewing mechanism must be introduced to avoid that occurrence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.2Notwithstanding the statements in your second reading speech as repeated to us in your letter of 3 June 1992 on the education and dissemination of information on the proposed new legal regime, there has in fact been no adequate or proper education of, or consultation with, the people of Christmas Island nor has any participative reviewing process been developed or implemented to study and analyse the laws prior to their application. With respect, dissemination of information via newsletters, radio or television is hardly a satisfactory form of consultation, education or participation, particularly given the nature and content of those newsletters and broadcasts. In addition, the officers of the Australian Government Solicitor have simply had insufficient time to carry out a meaningful analysis of all or most of the statutes of Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.3Furthermore, there has been no analysis whatsoever of the potential impact of the common law of Western Australia on Christmas Island, notwithstanding that the Territories Law Reform Bill states that such common law will apply on Christmas Island from 1 July 1992. Indeed, it is doubtful if many of the people of Christmas Island even know or understand what the common law of Western Australia is or means.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.4Many, if not most, of the residents of Christmas Island simply have no understanding, training or familiarity with the legislative or common law of Western Australia and have not been properly consulted, advised or educated as to the potential impact of this new legal regime, nor have the residents been able to properly participate in the introduction and the method of implementation of the proposed new legal regime. Many of the residents will not be aware that they have breached the proposed new laws, because they will not be aware of the nature or impact of the law. As you will be aware, ignorance of the law is no defence to a breach of the law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.5Whilst you now advise that legal advice will be made available to facilitate the community's awareness of the law, it is imperative that the Christmas Island residents be given access to such legal advice and education prior to the introduction of the law and not after. It is important that the people of Christmas Island be educated as to the operation of the law to ensure that they do not thereby breach the law, rather than imposing the law and then providing legal consultation to provide advice when laws have already been broken, albeit unintentionally.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.6This lack of education and training in the Australian system as well as the barriers of language, culture and attitude of the people of Christmas Island are acknowledged in the 1991 Strategic Plan prepared by the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and the Territories. (Refer Annexure "B" for details of these comments.) That Strategic Plan also acknowledges the need for participation, explanation and equality in the implementation of the new legal system. Unfortunately, these views seem to have been overlooked in the hasty introduction and application of the new legal system from 1 July 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.7Whilst it is recognised that a significant effort has been devoted to informing the community of the proposed new legal regime, there simply has been insufficient time and resources allocated to informing, educating and advising the people of the potential impact and operation of the new laws. The people of Christmas Island have not been given access to independent legal advice prior to the introduction of the new law, nor have they been given a general opportunity to participate in any analysis or review of the law and its potential application. This lack of available time has been exacerbated by a lack of resources and the inability to marshall and apply those resources. It must be recognised that Christmas Island is a remote community and therefore requires special planning and greater than normal time within which to implement such a substantial and overwhelming change as is contemplated by the introduction of a totally new legal regime. These special considerations do not seem to have been taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.8You have mentioned in your letter and in the second reading speech that processes and mechanisms are being developed to facilitate the Island community's awareness of the passage of legislation through Western Australian Parliament. Please advise as to what these processes and mechanisms are. It seems that whatever these processes are, they will certainly not be in existence at the time that it is proposed the new laws will become operative, i.e. by 1 July 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.9The people of Christmas Island have simply not been advised as to how they can exercise any powers to amend or vary such laws prior to their introduction on Christmas Island. This process needs to be established and explained before the new laws are introduced or become operative, rather than after. In summary, therefore, it is a fundamental requirement that the people of Christmas Island need to have an opportunity to be involved in a review and analysis of laws before they become applicable and not after.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN RELATION TO THE INTRODUCTION OF THE PROPOSED NEW LAW</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.1The Islands in the Sun Report devotes significant attention to actual and potential human rights violations on Christmas Island. Your second reading speech and correspondence acknowledge and refer to these justifiable criticisms. In paragraph 3.6.19 of the Report, reference is made to Human Rights Australia's condemnation of Australia's performance in fulfilling its human rights and international obligations to the residents of Christmas Island. In paragraph 3.6.22 of the Report, the House of Representatives Standing Committee states that it shares these concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.2However, the introduction of a wholesale new legal regime without adequate review, consultation and education does nothing more than to exacerbate these criticisms and concerns, rather than to overcome or solve such abuses. If the new legal regime is introduced in the manner which is proposed, then this will inevitably result in allegations of further human rights abuse. It is therefore imperative that the people of Christmas Island be properly involved in a review and consultation process prior to the introduction of the law to ensure that their needs, customs, traditions and special circumstances can be properly considered and taken into account before the new legal regime becomes operative and not after.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.3Mention has already been made by Christmas Island residents of the desirability for United Nations intervention to ensure that the natural justice and other rights of the people of Christmas Island are properly considered at the time of introduction of new laws. The Islands in the Sun Report refers to the fact that Christmas Island might already be a non self-governing territory. The Committee acknowledged that the possibility that Christmas Island is a non self-governing territory is "at the very least arguable" (refer paragraph 3.6.13). The Report also refers to a potential failure by the Commonwealth to deal with Christmas Island in a manner which accords with United Nations treaties or conventions to which Australia is a party (refer paragraph 3.6.22). If the Commonwealth Government proceeds with the introduction of the new legal regime on a wholesale basis, without adequate consultation as is currently proposed, this will inevitably lead to more aggressive action or demands for United Nations review, intervention or supervision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.SELECTIVE AND DISCRIMINATORY ENFORCEMENT OF THE LAWS OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.1Directors of Phosphate Resources NL, in their discussions with members of the Administration of Christmas Island and officers of the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and the Territories, have raised concerns that if the new legal regime is introduced in the wholesale manner as is proposed, than this will inevitably lead to disputes and arguments, because residents will be in breach of laws which they simply do not understand or simply did not know existed. It has been suggested that this problem will be overcome because the new laws will be enforced and implemented with "discretion and care".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.2Such a notion of selective or discretionary application of the laws by members of the Administration or the Department constitutes a fundamental breach of the general principle of law that the law should be applied honestly equally and fairly amongst all citizens. Any proposal, formal or informal, express or implied, that the proposed new legal regime will be applied in a selective or discretionary fashion constitutes an anathema to democratic principles of equality, justice and the fundamental rule of law. This again demonstrates the need for proper consultation and education on the potential impact of the laws of Western Australia prior to their introduction and not after.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.3It needs to be remembered of course that the courts are the ultimate arbiter of what is the law and not Government officers or delegates. It is vital therefore that the application of the law on Christmas Island be fair and even handed in its application and that it be seen to be so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.GENERAL LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEFECTS OR UNCERTAINTY IN THE LEGISLATION</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.1Based an the legal advice which Phosphate Resources NL has received, it is the view of Phosphate Resources NL that there are a number of defects in the Territories Law Reform Bill in its application to Christmas Island. In brief, these defects include:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)There is no definition given to the term "Western Australian laws" or "the law of Western Australia".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2)Section 8A of the Bill seeks to apply the common law of Western Australia, yet there is no way in which the common law of Western Australia can be identified, defined or determined. Thus it is not possible for the legislation to be applied or for the courts to enforce a law, which is uncertain, vague or not properly identified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3)Section 8(1) of the Bill seeks to repeal the law in force in the Territory prior to 1 July 1992. There is no definition given to the meaning of the term "law in force in the Territory". Presumably it is intended to include statutory enactments of Singapore and the United Kingdom. This is not made clear. It is questionable as to how the Commonwealth Government of Australia can repeal the application of laws of another sovereign country or foreign jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4)The Bill seeks to repeal the common law of Christmas Island in existence prior to 1 July 1992 and at the same time states that such repeal does not affect any right, privilege, obligation or liability accrued or incurred under that previously existing common law or anything done or permitted by that law. If however such common law ceases to exist, how will a resident pursue an action or legal right acquired under the common law prior to 1 July 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5)Lack of formal agreement with the Western Australian Government as referred to in paragraph 9.3 of this submission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.2Based on the legal advice which Phosphate Resources NL has received, it is the view of Phosphate Resources NL that the Territories Law Reform Bill and its manner of implementation and application are contrary to the provisions of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution. This will inevitably lead to litigation over the potential application of Western Australian laws on Christmas Island. It is therefore essential that such constitutional defects be reviewed, analysed and discussed prior to the introduction of the proposed new legal regime, rather than after.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.3The fact that proper constitutional analysis has not taken place is again demonstrative of the fact that the new law is being introduced with undue haste and without adequate planning, research, consultation or review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CITIZENSHIP ISSUES</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7.1There are significant citizenship issues which need to be addressed in relation to the implementation and operation of the proposed new legal regime. Many of the residents of Christmas Island are not citizens of Australia simply because they have wished to maintain their cultural and ethnic links with Asia and with their Asian parents or families. There is thus a need for the proposed new law to consider and deal with these citizenship issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7.2The Territories Law Reform Bill makes no reference to the question of citizenship and the manner in which this sensitive issue can be dealt with under the nsw legal regime. This is an issue of vital concern to the people on Christmas Island and needs to be carefully considered and dealt with before the new law is introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7.3It seems that citizenship might become a vital prerequisite for local government/local assembly voting. This issue needs to be considered and resolved before the introduction and application of the Local Government Act or other similar legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8.ADMINISTRATION AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8.1The Islands in the Sun Report makes particular mention of the need for the role of the Administrator of Christmas Island to be reviewed (refer Recommendation 13 paragraph 3.12.5). It is noted that the Territories Law Reform Bill contains no reference to this recommendation. Again it is essential, especially as part of the need to remedy any breaches of human rights in the Territory that the role of the Administrator be reviewed and replaced. This should be an essential component of the Law Reform Bill and is not dealt with at any stage in the legislation or the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8.2Similarly, it is recognised in the Islands in the Sun Report that the Christmas Island Assembly will play a vital and central role in the development and implementation of the new legal regime on Christmas Island and the establishment of a new local government body on the Island. In paragraph 3.10.7 of the Report, it is noted that it was emphasised to the House of Representatives Standing Committee that the people of Christmas Island held the majority view of a need for the Christmas Island Assembly to have a "say in respect of the Western Australian laws to be applied" on Christmas Island. In Recommendation 7 (paragraph 3.10.17) of the Report, the Committee acknowledged this concern in its recommendation for the acceleration of the institution and development of a local government body on Christmas Island. It was said that this was important to enable access to the Commonwealth Minister in respect of the new laws to apply on the Island.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8.3The Territories Law Reform Bill makes no provision for either of these essential characteristics of the proposed new legal regime. At this stage it seems that on 1 July 1992 the Western Australian Local Government Act will apply but will not at that time have been amended or modified to ensure that it both applies in a manner which meets the recommendations outlined in the Islands in the Sun Report or the special needs of Christmas Island and its people. The role and powers of the Assembly/Local Government are of vital interest in their potential impact on the operations and business of Phosphate Resources NL. Thus it is important that the company be advised and consulted on this proposed new role of the Assembly prior to its introduction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8.4Accordingly, it is again essential that the introduction of the new legal regime be delayed until a strategic plan has been developed for the creation and operation of this new local government body. This will again require interaction with the Christmas Island community, including of course Phosphate Resources NL, to ensure that the specific needs and requirements of the people are addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9.LACK OF ANY FORMAL AGREEMENT WITH THE WESTERN AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9.1Quite clearly in order of the Western Australian legal regime to apply properly and efficiently on Christmas Island, there is a need for agreement between the Commonwealth and the Western Australia State Government and the various departments, agents and instrumentalities of the Western Australia Government. As at 1 July 1992, no such agreement has been entered into.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9.2It is nonsensical to introduce the new legal regime until such agreement has been finalised. Without such agreement, the law cannot be properly administered or implemented and the residents of Christmas Island, including of course Phosphate Resources NL, cannot properly know or understand the practical manner in which the law will be applied to them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9.3The Territories Law Reform Bill requires as a major part of its practical application a need for enforcement, prosecution, review or other powers vested in the Commonwealth Minister, under Section 8D(1) to be exercised by Western Australian government departments or authorities under delegation from the Minister pursuant to Section 8D(3). At this stage, there is no framework in place for this delegation process to be implemented. There is little point in introducing legislation until these enforcement and operational procedures have been agreed and finalised between the Commonwealth and the Western Australian Government. Such procedures and agreements may require amendment to the Act or the underlying Western Australian legislation. These issues should be planned, resolved and implemented before the otherwise premature introduction and enactment of the Territories Law Reform Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">10.BREACH OF THE MINING LEASE BETWEEN PHOSPHATE RESOURCES NL AND THE COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">10.1The mining lease between the Commonwealth of Australia and Phosphate Resources NL and others was signed on 26 September 1990. That lease agreement makes no reference to the application of Western Australian laws on Christmas Island, nor was there any express or implied representation or indication given to Phosphate Resources NL of the potential operation of the Western Australian legal regime on Christmas Island at the time the lease agreement was signed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">10.2The implementation of Western Australian laws on Christmas Island will result in Phosphate Resources NL incurring substantial additional taxes, charges and operational expenditure, none of which is referred to in the lease agreement and none of which was referred to or made known to the company at the time of the signing of the lease agreement or the issuing of the tender by the Commonwealth Government. Phosphate Resources NL was thus not given an opportunity to include these new taxes and charges in its planning and budgeting process at the time of entering into the Lease Agreement. The Lease Agreement makes no mention of these additional items of expenditure, taxes and charges.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">10.3At this stage, the legislation contemplates that all Western Australian legislation imposing taxes and charges will be applicable on Christmas Island on 1 July 1992, but will be deferred in its operation and effect until 1 January 1993. With respect, such deferral for six months is entirely unsatisfactory. It would have been much more appropriate and responsible for a process of consultation and communication to have taken place between the Commonwealth and Phosphate Resources NL prior to the introduction of the proposed new legal regime and its concomitant taxes, charges and impost rather than after the introduction of that new legal regime.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">10.4The proposal by the Commonwealth Government to now implement legislation and common law which will have an unquestionable adverse financial, managerial and operational impact on the company without any consultation or liaison with the company is regarded by Phosphate Resources NL as a breach of the legal and constitutional obligations imposed on the Commonwealth Government. This will inevitably lead to disputation and a substantial claim for damages by Phosphate Resources NL against the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">11.ADDITIONAL TAXES, CHARGES AND EXPENSES</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">11.1The taxes and charges referred to in paragraph 10 above will also apply to other residents, individuals and businesses on Christmas Island and these parties should also have been given the opportunity to review and discuss the potential operation of these proposed new taxes and charges with the Commonwealth Government prior to their introduction and not after.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">11.2Your letter of 3 June 1992 refers to the deferment of various State Government taxes and charges until 1 January 1993. With respect, these taxes and charges need to be reviewed in their totality. There has been no investigation and analysis of the impact of these additional items on expenditure on the Christmas Island community. Again, there has been no participation by the residents of Christmas Island on the impact of these changes. The residents of Christmas Island, including of course Phosphate Resources NL, must be given warning about the effect of these additional items of expenditure, in order that they can be budgeted and planned for.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">11.3In the case of Phosphate Resources NL, the impact of payroll tax will of itself create a potential additional annual liability in excess of $200,000.00. Other charges such as Land Tax, Financial Institutions Duty, Stamp Duty and Tobacco Tax need to be planned for. This planning and budgeting process will require at least a two to three year period. These items of legislation should be postponed for at least this period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">12.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">THE CASINO</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">12.1It seems that one of the underlying reasons for the haste with which the proposed new legal regime is to be introduced to Christmas Island is fundamentally based on the concern that the Christmas Island Casino will commence operations on 1 July 1992. It was indicated to Phosphate Resources NL that it was essential that the Western Australian legal regime be in operation prior to the Casino commencing operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">12.2Phosphate Resources NL supports the Casino proposal and does not seek to detract from this project in any way. Nevertheless, the need for the introduction of any new legal regime on Christmas Island should, with respect, be determined by the needs and requirements of Phosphate Resources NL and the Island communities as a whole and not on the basis of the potential operations of the Casino.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">12.3In any event, due to litigation and disputation between the Casino owners and the builders of the Casino, it is now unlikely that the construction of the Casino will be finalised prior to 1 January 1993. Phosphate Resources NL understands that, since the commencement of such litigation work has not yet recommenced on the Casino site. Whilst Phosphate Resources NL is confident that the Casino project will unquestionably proceed to completion, such delays mean that the commencement of operations of the Casino will consequently be deferred until well after 1 January 1993. Therefore, this apparent driving force for application of the new legal regime by 1 July 1992 is no longer apposite. There is thus no reason why the introduction of the new legal regime could not be postponed for at least 6&mdash;12 months.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">12.4In any event, it is possible under the ordinance and Commonwealth legislative system which is already in existence for adequate laws to be enacted governing the conduct of operations of the Casino on an interim basis until the proposed new legal regime can be the subject of proper analysis, advice, consultation and education.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">13.THE METHOD OF INTRODUCTION AND FUNDAMENTAL BASIS OF THE TERRITORIES LAW REFORM BILL</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">13.1Mention has been made in paragraph 3 of this submission for the need for Christmas Island residents to be involved in the legislative review process, in order that they can be aware of new items of legislation. If the introduction of the Territories Law Reform Bill is to be used as an example, then there is significant cause for concern. Despite requests to the government by Phosphate Resources NL for a copy of the Bill in final or in draft, plus the explanatory memorandum and other explanatory information, such documents were never provided. Copies of these draft documents were finally obtained from the Opposition in late May 1992. A copy of the legislation as finally introduced to the Senate was also finally obtained (again from the Opposition) in early June 1992. As you can appreciate, this has only provided a very short period of time for this legislation to be reviewed and commented upon by the company and its advisers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">13.2In addition, Phosphate Resources NL has not been provided with and apparently cannot be provided with the ordinances which are to be passed as part of the Bill to modify, defer or amend the operation of Western Australian legislation in accordance with the Commonwealth Government's statements to that effect. Apparently drafting of some of these ordinances has not as yet been finalised. Please advise as to when these items of legislation can be made available.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">13.3At our meeting of 22 May 1992, Phosphate Resources NL raised the question as to why it was necessary to impose the whole of the legislation and common law of Western Australia and then to work backwards to delete those items which the Minister deigns to be inappropriate. It would seem a far more sensible and logical approach for the Commonwealth to adopt and apply on Christmas Island those items of Western Australian legislation (after necessary consultation, review and amendment) as are necessary or appropriate to the needs and objectives on Christmas Island. This would allow any important items of legislation such as the Criminal Code or Family Law Act to be reviewed as a priority and then applied immediately. The Minister indicated that she had raised this very same question and had received advice from the Attorney General's Department, that it was not legally possible to adopt this approach. The Minister indicated that she would again seek confirmation of, and the reasons behind, this advice from the Attorney-General's Department.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">13.4With respect, there seems no legal reason why this alternate and, in the view of Phosphate Resources NL, more sensible approach could not be adopted. Could you please advise whether the Attorney-General's Department has as yet responded to the Minister's request for further advice on this issue. If the Attorney-General's Department has not as yet responded, could the Minister please advise as to when a response could be expected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">13.5The Minister's letter of 3 June 1992 also refers to the grouping of Western Australian laws into various categories and annexes to that letter a list of those items of legislation. It is apparent from a review of those lists that many items of legislation (List A2 comprising approximately 140 Acts) apply immediately, but have not yet been fully analysed in detail as to their potential impact on Christmas Island or to businesses or residents on Christmas Island, including Phosphate Resources NL. List B identified 47 Acts which will apply immediately, but which may require modification or further assessment. List C identifies only 115 Acts which are to be suspended until 1 January 1993. Of those Acts which have been assessed and which are being modified, there has been no process of consultation, participation or liaison with Phosphate Resources NL as to those proposed modifications. As you can no doubt appreciate, the failure to have Phosphate Resources NL involved in that process does not give the company confidence that its views, or indeed the views of other residents, will be taken into account in the future, even if a review process is eventually established.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">13.6It should also be noted that impact statements on legislation which have been prepared are not in reality statements on the actual impact of legislation on Christmas Island, but rather constitute a general statement or summary on the operation of the statute. It should also be noted that the annexure to the Minister's letter of 3 June 1992 refers to 354 Acts (List A1) which are said to have no significant effect. Yet some of these Acts will affect Phosphate Resources NL and the people of Christmas Island, such as the Petroleum Act and the Dairy Industry Act or if they have no effect, such as the East Perth Cemeteries Act and many others, then why does this legislation need to apply to Christmas Island at all?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">14.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CONCLUSIONS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">14.1It is therefore the submission of Phosphate Resources NL that the proposed new legal regime is being introduced with unreasonable haste resulting in inadequate planning, consultation and investigation. In addition, it is the view of Phosphate Resources NL that the residents of Christmas Island have not been properly consulted, advised or educated in relation to the potential operation and effect of the new legal regime.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">14.2It is also the view of Phosphate Resources NL that the manner of introduction of the new legal regime ignores many of the views and recommendations of the House of Representatives Standing Committee Islands in the Sun Report. Undoubtedly, this has occurred because of the lack of time and therefore a lack of sufficient resources (notwithstanding the best efforts of all of the people involved) being allocated to this very difficult and complex, but nevertheless, vital project.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">14.3In the Government's own response (refer Annexure "C") to the recommendations in the Islands in the Sun Report, it is acknowledged that a consultation and education process is important (page 6). It is also acknowledged that a mechanism must be developed to facilitate the island community's awareness of the passage of new legislation through Parliament and to assist in the communication and explanation of the effects of such legislation. Yet, none of these recognised issues are dealt with in the Territories Law Reform Bill or the supporting Commonwealth or State Government administrative machinery.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">14.4Your letter of 3 June 1992 and your second reading speech also refer to assistance by Western Australian Government Departments and agencies. Yet, as at the date of this Report, Phosphate Resources NL has not received any advice or proposals from these departments or agencies as to how they might apply or operate Western Australian laws on Christmas Island. In any event, such proposals are at this stage likely to be preliminary and superficial, given the limited time for visits to the island and the conduct of the necessary study and investigation by such agencies and departments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">14.5Phosphate Resources NL is aware that similar concerns to those set out in this submission have been expressed by other community and business groups on Christmas Island, including the Union of Christmas Island Workers, the Assembly and the Christmas Island Chamber of Commerce. The fundamental thrust of those concerns has been the unreasonable haste and lack of consultation and participation in the content and manner of introduction of the proposed new legal regime.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">14.6In summary therefore, it is the submission of Phosphate Resources NL that it is essential for the Territories Law Reform Bill to be postponed in its enactment by at least a further prior of 12 months until the various issues raised in this submission have been the subject of further investigation and planning.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My dear Premier</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing to inform you of proposals to reform the legal regimes and associated administration in Australia's Indian Ocean Territories of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Island. I am also seeking your agreement in principle for the Western Australia Government to assist the Commonwealth in implementing these reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reviews conducted by the Commonwealth Grants Commission for the Cocos (Keeling) Islands in 1989 and by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in 1991 found that the legal regimes of the Indian Ocean Territories are now seriously out of date and unnecessarily complex to administer. Both bodies recommended replacement of the present legal regimes with a body of law based on that of the geographically nearest State administration, Western Australia. I am informed that the Committee held discussions with representatives of your Government about these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has decided to accept the recommendations and to apply the laws of Western Australia, as amended from time to time, and all Commonwealth laws, as the laws of the Indian Ocean Territories. It is proposed that the Western Australian based legal regime will be applied as Commonwealth law, under amendments to the Commonwealth's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act 1955</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Christmas Island Act 1958</EMPHASIS>. It is planned that the new regime will come into force from 1 July 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The responsibility for administration of Western Australian based laws and assistance measures will continue to rest with the Commonwealth. However, the Commonwealth Government believes that it would be desirable for your Government to administer the legal regimes of the Territories, and some Commonwealth programs, on behalf of the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, I seek your agreement to senior officials opening discussions on how best to advance these proposals. The Commonwealth contact is Ms Cathy Santamaria, First Assistant Secretary, Corporate Management and Territories, Department of the Arts, Sport, Environment, Tourism and Territories (06-2741555). I would be grateful if you could nominate an officer in your Department as a point of contact.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are a number of other issues which would need to be settled between our Governments. These matters could also be discussed by senior officials if and when your Government agrees in principle to my Government's proposal.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6E4">Senator TAMBLING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question, `What is the current Western Australian perspective with regard to these changes?' needs to be asked very carefully. I do not believe that there is any acknowledgment from Western Australia&mdash;there are certainly no formal agreements. I think that there would be apprehension on the part of the Western Australian Public Service Commission in this regard at this particular time, especially with regard to the modification of Western Australian laws that is still to occur, the degree of community consultation and the community expectations that are being raised for local government responsibilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are concerns echoing through the local communities in the Cocos and Christmas Islands of a Western Australian takeover by way of the application of Western Australian State charges and taxes. I note that the Minister for the Arts and Territories, Ms Fatin, put out a press release the other day saying, `Okay, I will put the taxes and charges off for a few months'. She is not putting the legislation off, but she is putting the taxes and charges off for a few more months. There is a degree of inconsistency in what is going on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth point is that Western Australia has not yet agreed to any complementary legislation or entered into any service delivery arrangements or agreements. Those agreements are not yet concluded. It has been said that there have been discussions, but those agreements are not in place. Western Australian agencies have not yet concluded their discussions on island about the operating arrangements. There is a vagueness about the delegation of powers that will apply in a week's time on 1 July to hundreds of Western Australian Acts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We certainly need to call into question the qualifications of the Administrators of both the Cocos Islands and Christmas Island to apply 700 Western Australian laws. I am not denigrating either of the current Administrators. One is from a union background, the other comes from a Labor background in this Parliament. But the qualifications and legal expertise needed to administer the legal implications are fundamental and important. It needs to be asked, `Will the Administrators be able to cope with the responsibilities that will be imposed on the Minister and, through him or her, the Administrators of both islands?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also a number of thorny issues running around both of these Indian Ocean Territories that are linked and very indicative of the poor administration. I will throw out a very humorous one&mdash;the purchase of an $800,000 rescue boat on Cocos Island. There was a RAAF crash in the island lagoon last year and no-one could get to the plane to service it quickly, so someone went out and bought a new rescue boat, but it cannot get up the damned lagoon. It cost $800,000. What have they named this boat? They have named it the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">R J Hawke</EMPHASIS>, without any consultation with the local community. The Malays of Cocos Island are thoroughly offended. Normally, a vessel of this nature would go through a process of naming in accordance with the Malay culture. The imams and everybody else have been insulted by this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is the casino on Christmas Island. In a question to Senator Collins earlier this week I highlighted the fact that the Indonesian developers of a $50m casino on Christmas Island have suddenly stopped work. The Minister assured me that there were no consequential financial problems on the island. I spoke to the President of the Chamber of Commerce yesterday and he said that the subcontractors had not been paid and, in turn, therefore, a number of suppliers and other people have major questions about payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to this casino, the Department of Employment, Education and Training has been engaging in an extensive education and training program in which hundreds of young people participate. That program now looks as if it will fall over. What will be the development for these young people?<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How will the club licensing that is necessary for gaming clubs on Christmas Island and the recreational club on Cocos Island continue? How will they be administered? How will the clubs service tourists? The issue has to come under the licensing laws of Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The corporate change in the structure of the trading cooperative on Cocos Island is also fundamental. It will drastically change the equity of the shareholding participants on that island.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is entering into a funny deal with regard to the purchase of Oceania House&mdash;the Clunies-Ross historical home&mdash;on Cocos Island. It is doing a trade-off with North Keeling Island, a national park, and the local council taking over this important heritage property&mdash;a swap of a million dollar property when it already has North Keeling Island. Suddenly it is doing a sleight of the hand  which will involve extensive costs in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about small business support on either of the islands&mdash;the underpinning of enterprise development? It seems to me that the Department was looking at the casino as being the fundamentally important linchpin. I question whether the haste to get this legislation in place is in order to accommodate a gaming regulation control mechanism for the operation of that multimillion dollar casino. This legislation is not aimed at tourists from Australia, it is aimed at Chinese, Indonesian and Malay millionaire gamblers who will need to put $50,000 on the table before they walk into the casino on any weekend. I believe that the haste with which this legislation is now being foisted on this Parliament is predicated on a deal between the Government and the Indonesian casino developers. To ensure that there is no funny business going on there, I accept that there needs to be a good control mechanism for the casino, but it now appears that the project is in jeopardy and could well fall over. So why the haste?<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Questions do need to be asked. Is it because of ministerial incompetence? Is it because the Department snowed either the Minister or the Government with the pressures that have just been built up? The issues that were addressed in the House of Representatives report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Islands in the Sun</EMPHASIS>, are fundamental. They are very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The process that is now being put in place is one that can only lead to disaster if it is not done properly. If the arrangements with the Western Australian Government are not all out on the table, it could well be another WA Inc. under another guise. I believe that will be a fundamental issue. Unless the Western Australia Government is prepared to come out and say, `Yes, we back this. We are in bed with this deal 100 per cent. Here are all the contracts, here are all the agreements', we will probably be fighting in Estimates committees and other places of this Parliament for the next 10 years. There is certainly apprehension on the islands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One needs also to ask: is there a financial cover-up because of the commitment of the $132m to a capital works project by the Government? It this legislation needed to prop that up, or is it introduced because of the growth aspirations of various government departments?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I refer to the final clauses of this Bill, relating to the dealings with Norfolk Island, which only highlight the inconsistency of the legislation. We are well aware that the Government has been locked in an argument with Norfolk Island for some time about the incorporation of Australian residents on the island into an Australian electorate for voting purposes. The Government came to an agreement; it made a deal. The Government settled all of that a month ago but it could not get it into this legislation. All the Government has done in this Bill is tidy up the pay packets of the members of the Legislative Assembly on Norfolk Island. The Government can foist 700 Western Australian Acts of Parliament onto 1,900 people in the Indian Ocean but it cannot tidy up the major Norfolk Island arrangements which were surprisingly so important. The Government set the political agenda by trying to get the people of Norfolk Island into a Labor-held Canberra seat. That fell apart and became embarrassing because the Government did not win&mdash;the Norfolk Islanders had a better view of the issue and won at the end of the day. The Government did not bring Norfolk Island into this legislation because it did not want to go through a legislative process. Yet it can attempt to snow the Parliament on Cocos and Christmas Islands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I sincerely hope that when the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs sits on Monday and looks at the submissions it has already received&mdash;perhaps some more will come in over the weekend, because I will be inviting the residents of Cocos Island and Christmas Island to fax in additional comments&mdash;it will say to the Government, `Hey, your pace is too fast'. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find it almost anachronistic to be talking about Territories these days&mdash;nevertheless, we are. We have to ensure that residents of Territories have a right to the same principles of law as the rest of us. The Territories Law Reform Bill is unusual. It proposes to replace the legal systems which apply in the Territories located off Western Australia. Commonwealth and Western Australian law would replace the existing legal systems commencing from 1 July this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Tambling has given a thorough overview of the scope of the legislation. I intend to be brief. I have not had the benefit of a visit to the Territories so I will have to rely on the evidence presented to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and a reading of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are separate provisions in the Bill with respect to the legal systems of Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, as well as an unrelated amendment concerning the devolution of power to set the remuneration of members of the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly. As has been said, this Bill arose from a report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Islands in the Sun</EMPHASIS>. That Committee examined the legal regimes which exist in Australia's external territories. The report pointed out that the current situation is totally unacceptable in some regards. For example, on Christmas Island there are laws from Singapore and the United Kingdom which include some archaic penalties, such as flogging. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matters in this legislation are complex and will be fully investigated by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which is conducting an inquiry into this Bill on Monday. The Democrats will be represented on that Committee by Senator Spindler. We have received some representations that, at least in respect of Christmas Island, the adoption of the Western Australian legal system should be delayed because the residents are not yet prepared for, nor cognisant of, the laws which will apply to them from either 1 July 1992 or 1 January 1993. As always with legal changes, there are commercial matters which get caught up and which will be affected if this legislation is agreed to&mdash;changes which affect the phosphate mining operation which is the major business undertaking on the island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we should also remember that there are a lot of other matters which were raised in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Islands in the Sun</EMPHASIS> report that are not dealt with in this legislation. For example, the Territories of Ashmore and Cartier Islands are to be incorporated into the Northern Territory, and the rather ticklish issue of the Federal voting rights of residents of Norfolk Island has not been satisfactorily resolved. However, many of the controversial questions will be dealt with by the Committee on Monday. Senator Tambling paints an alarming picture of some of them. I was glad to hear that it was not another deal with the Democrats, but with the Indonesian Government this time. The Democrats will be supporting the second reading of this Bill and we will reserve our position on the other matters until all the evidence is collected on Monday. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this place I represent Tasmania, which is probably the place in Australia which is farthest away from the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, and one might wonder why I would want to stand here and say a few things about the Territories Law Reform Bill. Firstly, obviously I have a responsibility not only as a senator to represent Tasmania but as a senator to represent the whole of Australia, including the people of Cocos (Keeling) Islands, who overwhelmingly voted to be part of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a Bill which purports to give a legislative response to the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Islands in the Sun: The Legal Regimes of Australia's External Territories and the Jervis Bay Territory</EMPHASIS>. I have listened carefully to what Senator Tambling and Senator Kernot have said. I have looked at the second reading speech and, as far as is possible, the explanatory memorandum. It did not occur to me until this morning that this Bill should be of quite major significance to all members of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Tambling has described the fact that hundreds and hundreds of pieces of Australian legislation&mdash;that is, Federal legislation and Western Australian legislation&mdash;will be imposed upon the peoples of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. The question that I want to raise is whether those people have been properly and adequately consulted. Senator Tambling is shaking his head, indicating that they have not been properly and adequately consulted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Tambling, of course, has particular interests as a senator for the Northern Territory and has the capability, which others do not, of going to Cocos and Christmas islands and studying the situation there. He has reported to us this morning. I am concerned that there is a far greater need for the rest of us in this chamber to study the implications of this measure. I note in the second reading speech that the only court which is specifically to have jurisdiction in Cocos and Christmas islands from 1 July 1992 is the Family Court of Western Australia exercising jurisdiction under the Family Law Act 1975. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am glad to see that Senator Tate is the Minister in the chamber. I think that on Senator Tate and his colleagues will fall the responsibility of deciding whether the Family Law Act in Australia is appropriate to impose upon the peoples of Cocos and Christmas islands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A large number of concerns are being expressed within Australia about not only the administration of the Family Law Act but also the basis upon which the Family Law Act in Australia has been founded, which causes feelings of injustice amongst hundreds and thousands of people in Australia. Such tragedy has been caused as a result of recourse by certain parties to the provisions of the Family Law Act when those parties simply wish to opt out of their responsibilities. These are the sorts of considerations which I believe the Minister for the Arts and Territories (Ms Fatin) and the Government must again consider. Indeed, they must consider whether the people of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Island agree with that. To properly consider it, they must have further consultations with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know&mdash;and I note that Senator Tambling, in his speech on the second reading, indicated that he did not really know&mdash;whether there have been full, adequate and complete consultations with Western Australia. We were told in the Minister's second reading speech that hundreds and hundreds of Western Australian laws will apply to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Island after 1 July 1992. The second reading speech said that it is expected that some 350 Western Australian laws could be applied in full from 1 July 1992 without adverse impact. It also said that approximately another 140 laws would have a noticeable impact but that the on-island changes required could be readily accommodated from 1 July 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not seen those laws. It is important that the Senate and, more particularly, the people of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Island see what those laws are in Western Australia. It is important for the Minister at the table, Senator Tate, to see what they are. With this piece of legislation, the Government is imposing not only the beneficial but also the adverse aspects of certain Federal and Western Australian laws on the people of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Island. I do not think we should do that lightly. We are doing it lightly if we propose to carry this measure through this chamber under the guillotine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is not giving true freedom of speech and expression to the people of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Island because it has not adequately consulted them. And the Government is not giving us our rights of expression because it has agreed to the guillotine. It has limited debate on this measure, as it has limited the debate on a number of other measures. Under those circumstances, I believe it is essential that this matter be deferred until those prerequisites occur&mdash;that is, proper consultation with the people of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Island after they have been provided with the detailed information that they need for the consideration of the implications that this measure will have for them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition will be supporting the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Amendment Bill 1992, the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Amendment Bill 1992 and the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 1992 which are now before the Senate. I take this opportunity not only to note our reservations about these Bills and some aspects of them which are inadequate, but more particularly to move amendments on behalf of the Opposition to all three Bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present Government, after nine tired years of centralism, is continuing to let down the people of Australia in the whole education area&mdash;in schools, in technical and further education and in universities. In a number of areas we have now reached a crisis point as a result of the bureaucratic interference of this Government and the suppression of initiatives that can locally be made to meet the needs of Australians in schools, in TAFE and in universities. We in the Opposition are fed up with the failures of the Labor Government in education. I am convinced that the only way ahead now is for the Government to lose office at the coming Federal election and for the imaginative and positive policies set out in the coalition's Fightback package to be given a chance to bring remedies for our schools, for TAFE and for universities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The States Grants (Schools Assistance) Amendment Bill 1992 is, for the most part, in the usual format for this time of the year in giving supplementation of moneys. In particular, it gives an extra $15m in capital grants for non-government schools in 1992. This is hopelessly inadequate&mdash;$15m extra when in fact there should be a doubling of the moneys available to meet the capital needs of the non-government schools of Australia. The coalition is committed to a doubling of capital grants, that is, $81m, not the measly $15m that this Government has come up with in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole policy of the Labor Party for the last nine years has been increasingly to put screws upon middle Australian families&mdash;a whole 25 per cent of Australian families who want to enrol their children in schools of their choice, disciplined non-government schools in which they have confidence. But this Government has prevented such schools being built. So there is a huge set of waiting lists around Australia for such schools. All I can say is that the Liberal and National parties will immediately remove those restrictions placed by the Labor Party on the formation of new non-government schools so that families can exercise their choice, as is their right and as ought to be the freedom in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give one example only from my own State of South Australia. Trinity School in Gawler has recently been established. It has the objective of excellence in education, good resources and also a very big commitment from its teachers. I know well the principal of the school, Mr Michael Hewitson, whom I have known since a teenager. Lo and behold, this school is full. Not only is it full, but there is also a waiting list of 4,000 students in the northern suburbs of Adelaide who want to go to this new school. This waiting list has been relieved by a recent extension of the school to another campus, but it is typical of the frustration of many Australian families at the moment, and this is inadequate provision by the Government. </PARA>

<PARA>I now move on to the second Bill, the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Amendment Bill. This Bill is also in the normal format and it provides supplementation of about $800,000 for 1992&mdash;just short of $1m. More particularly, it provides about an additional $100m all-up over a period for recurrent and capital funding. It is a beginning by this Government to making available the resources for that most needed area of education in Australia currently, and that is for the training of young adults and others in the TAFE sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the whole area is in turmoil because of the recent statements of the Prime Minister, Mr Keating. He is browbeating the Ministers of education in the States; he is forcing them to the centralism of Canberra that has become the byword of this Labor Government here, as can be seen by the headlines in recent weeks with regard to the Premiers Conference and the protests of particularly the State governments of Western Australia and South Australia&mdash;Labor governments, I might add. They are protesting, rightly, to the oppressive centralism and dictatorial methods of the Prime Minister, Mr Keating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Does he consult even his own Ministers before making those statements? He does not consult. I think he has embarrassed his own members, both front bench and back bench alike, in the pronouncements he has recently made with regard to TAFE. He has said to the States, `Toe my line or you don't get your money'. Well, the Opposition wants to support the making available of this extra $100m, but without those restraints. Therefore, our criticism is set out in a second reading amendment protesting at the behaviour of the Government in this regard. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I want to emphasise that the Liberal and National parties wish to have a cooperative approach with the States. We will consult and cooperate and we will not dictate to the States with regard to these matters. I have time only to note two major commitments of the Opposition. One is that we accept the targets in the Finn report, the major review of TAFE. Secondly, we offer the States an extra $520m over the remaining years of this decade&mdash;above the present funding for TAFE; that is, above the funding in this Bill&mdash;and it is fully funded; it is fully accounted for; it is not some empty promise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now move on to the third and final Bill, the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill, in the minute or so remaining to me. I note that $86m over the triennium is provided in the usual way for higher education. Nevertheless, there is a very offensive part of the Bill and that is the transference of moneys destined for the John Curtin School of Medical Research from this education Bill to be administered through the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services. My good colleague Senator John Tierney, who has been most outspoken on this matter, will be speaking precisely on this offensive decision of the Government. It is partly to allow him to speak at proper length that I have reduced my speaking time here in the Senate today. Therefore, I urge honourable senators to listen most carefully to Senator Tierney's critique of the inadequacies, the failures and, I believe, the abuses of this Government with regard to the John Curtin School at the ANU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another matter and that is with regard to unmet demand. At the moment it is running at 50,000 Australian students; 50,000 would-be students are cut out of our universities because of the inadequate policies of this Government. We are addressing that in our Fightback policies. I note that, although there are some additional moneys set out in this Bill, partly to help the present problem of unmet demand, they are inadequate. They will not solve it&mdash;and they will not solve it by that mechanism alone. We need a different policy approach&mdash;the kind of policy I have already outlined here in the Senate by the provision of $3,000m additional in new programs that the Liberal and National parties have promised for the remainder of the 1990s.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I rise to discuss the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 1992, the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Amendment Bill 1992 and the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Amendment Bill 1992. These three cognate Bills are adjustments to funding levels which occur on a fairly regular basis and as such they give us an opportunity to have a rave about the state of education in Australia. Many of the increases outlined in the Bill were flagged as part of the Government's One Nation package. The Australian Democrats will not be opposing these Bills. I have also indicated to Senator Teague that we will be supporting his second reading amendment in respect of universities and TAFE, but not for schools.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current education debate is tightly focused on the issue of competency based training and the future role of TAFE, despite glaring deficiencies in our school, higher education and university systems, which also need to be addressed. It is an appropriate time to evaluate these reforms that have been implemented over the last five years and to investigate future directions. What emerges from this process is the need for a blueprint that clearly outlines a future education and training system for Australia, given that the responsibility of TAFE is now up in the air. A more flexible and expanded education system is required to meet the needs of a changing work force and to deal with the effects of award restructuring. The introduction of new technology in the workplace has rendered many unskilled and low skilled jobs obsolete. Our work force and employers must face the need for better training and multiskilling in the face of these enormous changes. This is also important in the light of soaring school retention rates, the consequent high levels of unmet demand in further education and record levels of youth unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 1992 before the Senate today amends the Higher Education Funding Act 1988. Introduced by the Hon. John Dawkins, the Act marks a radical change in the higher education sector, with reforms the pace and extent of which are unprecedented. Clause 26 of this Bill alters the maximum level for capital grants for higher education institutions over 1992-94, and includes funding to address enrolment pressures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill also reflects the funding transfer for the John Curtin School of Medical Research from the Department of Employment, Education and Training to the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services. The recent Senate Standing Committee report into the John Curtin School examined the arguments behind this funding transfer and the notion of university autonomy. Although the Committee concluded that the Minister had not overstepped his brief, the minority report supported by the Australian Democrats denounces this funding change. The responsibility of funding the school should not rest with the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services. Despite legal advice which suggests the Minister may have acted ultra vires of the ANU Act, the Government still seeks to pursue this senseless measure. It would be fair to say that universities are still recovering from the effect of the Dawkins reforms. The abolition of the binary divide and amalgamations saw institutions consolidated from 70 to 46 in number, with many of these campuses spread far and wide in geographical terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the potential administrative savings have been attractive, in many cases amalgamations have not been happy ones. For example, in New South Wales the long running dispute between Armidale and Northern Rivers campuses has absorbed much energy from academics and students alike. Thousands of dollars have been wasted as academics from far-flung parts of the State have attempted to meet for regular council meetings. Some amalgamations have made sense, but the Democrats have opposed those ridiculous amalgamations, such as the one I have just outlined. In the case of the University of New England, we have called on the New South Wales Minister for Education to disamalgamate the two campuses post-haste. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The huge growth of student numbers has also seen the proliferation of new campuses around Australia. This is to be welcomed. However, it has also brought with it a debate about the role of universities, as these new campuses have sought to adopt a more entrepreneurial focus to their curriculum. Many of these newer institutions see themselves as providers of education in disciplines which fill a need for graduates in a particular field. Many of the older institutions, designed along the traditional Oxbridge model, have felt threatened by these developments as they have sought to protect their structures, courses and research agendas from the real or perceived threat to their jealously guarded independence. Indeed, I believe it is this essential conflict of style which lay at the heart of the University of New England amalgamation problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a role for both types of institutions in Australia today. Students are demanding curricula relevant to their needs and their job aspirations. On the other hand, universities are coming to grips with the role they must play in the national economic scene. Higher education cannot be isolated from these developments whilst retaining the traditional role it has played as social commentator, the source of new ideas and the repository of the nation's intellectual wealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Increasingly, our educational future will be characterised by advances in technology. The announcement in Western Australia last week that video universities are on the way is one example. The open learning program is now in place and should be encouraged as a means of increasing access to education for traditionally disadvantaged groups, including rural students, part time and mature aged students, especially women in the home caring for children and people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We may even reach a stage in 25 years time when the traditional lecture, which forms the backbone of teaching at institutions, actually  becomes obsolete. However, there is a danger in regarding open learning as a solution to the problem of unmet demand. Enrolment trends from open learning programs already record minimal interest from school leavers attempting entry into universities or TAFE. Through distance education and electronic innovations, I believe we are on the verge of a whole new method of learning. This will in the long term radically alter the nature of participation in education delivery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Open learning also has an important role to play in developing links with other nations. It has great potential as an export service and to strengthen our ties with Asia, one of the strongest importers of education services. Strengthening our links internationally will contribute to our international competitiveness, as well as the quality of our teaching and research. However, we must proceed cautiously to ensure that the best and most effective services and technologies are used. Institutions will still need adequate capital resources. For example, libraries must not be allowed to decline in range or quality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This debate about the role of universities has again been brought into sharp focus by the current discussions regarding TAFE as the national training provider and its role in delivering post-secondary education. While enrolments at universities have soared over the last few years, interest in  TAFE courses has declined from 22 per cent to 12 per cent over the last 8 years, despite increased participation in higher education in schools. This needs investigation, as does the perceived lower status of TAFE in the eyes of the community. Despite this, it is estimated that over 100,000 students missed out on TAFE places this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondary school retention rates continue to climb and are expected to reach 80 per cent by 1994. The Finn review into post-compulsory education sets new targets for participation and they are to be supported. According to Finn, by 2001, 95 per cent of all 19-year-olds should have completed or be participating in year 12 or a TAFE or training equivalent. This is supported by the Australian Democrats. The Finn recommendations would result in a 55 per cent increase in TAFE places over the decade and estimates from the Ramsay Committee into TAFE indicate that as much as $5 billion to $6 billion is required to meet these recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Beazley, claimed in his second reading speech that the Commonwealth was `offering to take full funding responsibility for the development of a new and expanded system of vocational training'. Over the past few weeks we have seen much huffing and puffing from the Government and the States over whose responsibility the TAFE sector really is. Instead of developing a much needed strategy for resolving what amounts to a dispute, the Government has reacted with bluffs, threats and ultimatums. There has been much debate, but little action. To that extent the Australian Democrats will be moving an amendment to paragraph (c) of Senator Teague's second reading amendment on the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Amendment Bill to include, after the word `institutions', the words `without the consent and cooperation of the States'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is vitally important, if we are to have a nationally coordinated TAFE sector, that the States be consulted and given some say as to how many of the pressing issues are to be resolved. Clearly that is not happening at the moment. The combination of high levels of unmet demand and record youth unemployment make the development of a clear strategy for TAFE's future imperative. The Australian Democrats believe that TAFE should have a national focus, but threats by the Government to establish a parallel system of vocational training are senseless. We must have a commitment to the creation of a system that is based on cooperation and consultation between the Commonwealth and the States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the idea of establishing a national training board. It would play a key role in overseeing TAFE while correcting the anomalies that currently exist: different fees, up-front charges and course standards. This idea concurs with the recommendations contained in the Carmichael report. The report, which proposes a new entry level training system for Australia, identifies TAFE as the major provider of advanced vocational training in a network of senior secondary colleges, skills centres and public and private providers of on-the-job and off-the-job training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Carmichael offers an exciting long term strategy for training in this country with the implementation of competency based training and assessment. However, issues such as youth wage levels and the extent of competency based training need resolution. The Australian Democrats await with interest the youth job summit proposed by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), and likewise his proposals about a youth wage. Our concern is that youth wages may fall to unacceptably low levels resulting in the creation of two youth underclasses: those without jobs and those with jobs on below-the-poverty-line wage levels. A fall in the real level of youth incomes must not be allowed to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly a national training strategy is needed if young people are to take their place in the work force as productive employees with a range of skills and able to face a changing workplace. At this stage TAFE, in its currently fragmented form of State based education, is simply not equipped for that role. The issue of credit transfer and recognition of prior learning across State boundaries must be resolved. Funding must be massively increased and the role in this process of continuing education, or adult education as it is sometimes known, must be established and recognised and folded into this dynamic process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The implications for universities of competency based training are unclear. A university education requires more than delivering curricula from key competencies. The Government must be careful that, when it sets the education agenda, it is not simply asking universities to become an extension of the TAFE sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The States Grants (Schools Assistance) Amendment Bill 1992 provides for an injection of an additional $15m for capital grants to non-government schools in 1992, as announced in the One Nation statement in February this year. Commonwealth funding for non-government schools has increased steadily since the late 1970s, as have enrolments in this area. We do not oppose this funding increase, but I reiterate the support of the Democrats for the government schools sector. We recognise that many parents choose to send their children to non-government schools, and it is their choice to seek the sort of education that those schools offer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, Government funding priorities must be with the government sector. Many government schools are underfunded, understaffed, and plagued with poor student-staff ratios, leaky buildings and poor resources. The Government needs to recognise that, as school retention rates increase, additional stresses will be placed on the Budget from government and non-government schools in the long term. Provisions for growth in outlays must be made here as well as in post-secondary education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, four years after the implementation of the Dawkins-led reforms into Australia's higher education system, we have reached a crisis point.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today before the Senate are the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Amendment Bill, the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Amendment Bill and the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill, which have been joined in cognate debate and which all relate to additional funding for various sectors of the higher education system. We currently have a situation where our education system is in crisis. Our higher education institutions are left overcrowded and underfunded. Our schools are crying out for capital works. The vocational education system is straining to meet the enormous demands with limited facilities and 200,000 young people who wish to upgrade their knowledge and skills at either university or TAFE are unable to gain a place at these institutions, even though they are qualified to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government expects the education sector to pick up the slack from the economic disaster that it has created through the recession we had to have by hiding in post-secondary education the vast numbers of young people who would otherwise be out looking for work. Our young people know that there are too few jobs out there. Instead, they stay at school longer, enter more training courses or go on to tertiary education. Higher retention rates are necessary and should be encouraged, but not as a way of hiding the plight of our jobless young people. Of course, the Government expects the education sector to pick up the forgotten people of its economic disaster; it does not provide the funding that is needed to do so. The result is a demoralised education sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These Bills represent a belated funding attempt and go a small way towards what is needed. I turn first to the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Amendment Bill. The sole purpose of this Bill is to provide an additional $15m in capital funding for non-government schools. This amount would be welcomed by the non-government schools. However, it is a pittance compared with what they need and compared with the fact that under the Fightback policies of the coalition capital funding to non-government schools will be doubled to an amount of $162m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have recently addressed meetings in Gosford and Lismore of up to 800 people regarding the urgent need for capital funding in these areas. I am well aware of the problems facing other non-government schools. Catholic schools on the central coast of New South Wales need an additional $19m. Catholic schools on the far north coast of New South Wales need an additional $39m. If parents want private education for their children, governments should not stand in their way; indeed, they should positively assist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the research shows that the most effective schools are those where the teachers and parents work in close partnership. Non-government schools are an essential component of Australian schooling. Twenty-eight per cent of all school pupils attend non-government schools and this is growing by one percentage point per year. The vast majority of children in non-government schools, contrary to popular belief, are from families in the low to middle income range. Non-government schools express not only the right of parents to choose schooling which reflects their values but also the willingness of parents to commit their own resources to schooling on a large scale which make savings to the taxpayer of $1.6 billion a year possible. Government funds are therefore able to be concentrated on government schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The requirements for infrastructure have increased substantially because of higher retention rates and changing curriculum requirements. The real annual value of Commonwealth capital grants to non-government schools has declined by almost 30 per cent over the last 10 years of this Labor Government when increased student numbers are taken into account. The coalition believes that the community interest in a viable and high quality non-government school sector is not being adequately expressed in the current government capital works program. Accordingly, the incoming coalition government will double the annual size of capital grants in the program to non-government schools to a level of $162m per year. The increased payments under this program will commence in the 1993-94 year. The level of grant still required for the substantial contribution to capital development from parents and communities supporting non-government schools will, of course, still be there. However, the current burden will be greatly alleviated with the increase in funding that we are proposing under Fightback. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Amendment Bill is the next Bill in this package. It is intended to appropriate funds for TAFE in accordance with the November statement on the economy and employment and to provide supplementary grants for 1992. It is interesting at this point to contrast the Government's TAFE  policy with that of the coalition. The Government is struggling to find a TAFE policy. It has proposed to take on the funding of TAFE, yet no-one&mdash;not even the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)&mdash;appears to know whether this will occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the Estimates committee hearings I questioned DEET about the costs and staffing involved in developing the Federal Government's new TAFE proposals launched by the Prime Minister a few Sundays ago.

Senator Collins knows it was nonsense. The whole of Australia knows it was nonsense. The TAFE sector was outraged by it because it realised what nonsense it was.

While the former Minister for Education  was concentrating on wrecking the higher education system by his so-called national unified system&mdash;something that is better located in the old eastern Europe, certainly not in a system of autonomous universities&mdash;and by amalgamation, he totally neglected TAFE. He did not put any extra funding into it at all. The levels of funding for TAFE throughout this decade have stayed fairly stagnant. The Minister has been in government for nine years. Why has his Government not done something before now? If it is the correct policy to have training levels up now, why was it not the correct policy over the nine years of his Government? If we have levels of training in this country of 23 per cent, but Japan, the United States and Germany have much higher levels, why did this Government not move funding up to that level? Why has the Prime Minister just belatedly discovered this?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the Australian electorate will do that; we will not have to do anything. Let us go back to the matter of the TAFE sector. If we turn to what the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document says on our future policy and on the levels of skills in this country, we realise that it is a key aspect of international competitiveness.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at some of the overseas rates to underline the points I have made. The participation rate in the post-secondary sector in West Germany is 65 per cent for 18- to 19-year-old males; United States, 58 per cent; Japan, 50 per cent; and Australia, 30 per cent. As the OECD states, much remains to be done to improve the skill of our work force. In Japan more than 80 per cent of firms provide some formal training for the work force. In Australia that figure is 24 per cent. Clearly, much reform is needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To this end the Liberal and National parties believe that it is essential to move towards a national reporting of standards of attainment based on nationally accepted and objective forms of assessment for the key competencies required for success in the workplace, particularly language, communication and numeracy skills, extending to scientific and technological understanding of students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike the Government, there is nothing conditional in our approach. We have accepted the targets for growth in TAFE as outline in the Finn report and we will, in government, work with and not against the States and Territories to ensure greater freedom for TAFE institutions to respond to the need of local industries and communities. This policy contrasts vividly with the policy of the Labor Government to date. For this reason, the Opposition welcomes the Australian Democrats' amendment that we have a more cooperative arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While TAFE is generally the responsibility of the States, the Federal Government should ensure that a high level of skill in the work force is achieved for the national interest. The Labor Government has never adopted a comprehensive strategy to this end. The money appropriated under this Bill for TAFE, although welcome, is sadly, yet typically, a case of too little too late. This contrasts with the coalition, which recognises the key role of TAFE and which, to ensure that TAFE is adequately supported, has undertaken in the Fightback program to increase funding by $75m a year above the current level of commitment, or $450m, to fund growth in TAFE over the remaining years of this decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I move to the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill. This Bill gives effect to the decision announced in the November statement on education and employment and the One Nation statement. It provides the usual supplementation, inadequate funding for additional student intake for the 1992-94 triennium and even more inadequate additional funding for higher education capital works. This is a pathetic attempt by the Government to address the many problems in the higher education sector that it has created. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Problems of unmet demand and overcrowding are largely the result of rigidities imposed by the Government's regulatory and funding framework for higher education. Institutions are limited in their admissions by bureaucratically determined quotas, their access to capital for development is unduly restricted, student charges are determined by the government, course profiles require government approval and there are serious rigidities in employment conditions for staff. All of these factors prevent institutions from responding adequately to demand. Under Fightback there will be sufficient deregulation of the higher education sector so that demand can be met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also under Fightback the government will not be attempting to intervene in the autonomy of a university as the Government has done in the ANU. The John Curtin School of Medical Research is an integral part of the ANU. Yet the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) has decided to take funding for this school away from the ANU and put it in the hands of the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter has caused great concern at the ANU, and indeed has grave implications for the autonomy of all the universities of Australia. It was particularly disturbing to see the Minister attempt to do this by circumventing the will of the Parliament and to do this without appropriate legislation so that his actions and their implications could not be scrutinised by the Senate. Indeed, I have a legal opinion that the Minister may have acted ultra vires the Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When questioned on the funding of the John Curtin School in the Estimates Committee, it was finally discovered after much probing that the transfer of funding from the Department of Employment, Education and Training to the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services was hidden because the movement of funds out of DEET was replaced with additional funding for exactly the same amount to the ANU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minus $8.2m was matched exactly by another $8.2m in supplementary funding. It was like something out of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yes, Minister</EMPHASIS>. By some extraordinary technicality, this additional funding did not have to be scrutinised by the Senate as it involved no extra appropriation being sought by DEET. Hopefully, this will not occur again, due to the action of the Senate on that night, when it quickly moved to close this loophole with the agreement of both the Labor Government and the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On questioning as to how the funding for the John Curtin School and the additional funding for the ANU could be exactly the same, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) stated to the Senate that it was not exactly equal and that there would be an adjustment in the Higher Education Funding Act. Now that we have the Bill amending that Act, I would like the Minister to point out exactly where that adjustment is. It would also be helpful if the Minister would explain the extraordinary events surrounding the explanatory memorandum and second reading speech for this Bill in the other place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An original version of both these documents exists which mentions the John Curtin School. Later, a revised edition was issued, even though the first version had been distributed from the Bills and Papers Office after Minister Baldwin had incorporated and tabled his speech. Presently, only the second version has been recorded in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and only the second version is available from the Table Office. For the benefit of the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins), who is at the table, I will read the paragraph that was omitted from the second version of the second reading speech by Minister Baldwin. The missing paragraph states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the Bill provides for a variation in the funds available under the Act to reflect the Government's decision to transfer funding responsibility for the John Curtin School of Medical Research from the Department of Employment, Education and Training to the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services.</PARA>
<PARA>I expect that the Minister will be able to explain why this information was left out of the revised version of the second reading speech and why similar information was dropped from the explanatory memorandum when he explains to us where in the Bill the balancing item regarding the John Curtin School is located. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government's attempts to administer the higher education sector have become a farce, as the situation at the John Curtin School of Medical Research illustrates. It is time for the Minister to stop interfering in our higher education institutions and to give control of the John Curtin School back to the ANU. The ANU tells us that the Government is simply creating an administrative mess and that it should reverse the funding decisions immediately while it is still easy to do so. Then the Government should stop interfering in higher education in such destructive ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The three Bills before the Senate today will not be opposed by the Opposition. They do, however, provide another opportunity to see the appalling way in which this Labor Government handles the education sector. The Opposition will treat the education sector with the importance it deserves. It is vitally important for the economic well-being of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major feature of the Fightback program is the commitment of the Liberal and National parties to greatly improve levels of resources at all levels of Australian education. In total, the coalition is proposing a fully costed and funded package of measures for education and training of an additional $3 billion over the rest of the decade. The Fightback education policy is needed for Australia urgently, not the uncoordinated, `throw a bit more money at the problem' approach the Government presents us with today in these Bills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday, I was in the process of putting to the Senate three areas of concern that the Opposition had in relation to the Crimes (Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Amendment Bill 1992. I had just touched upon the third of those concerns which related to proposed new section 8A which reproduces article 3.3 of the UN Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. It provides that, if a particular knowledge, intent or purpose is an element of an offence against the Act, that knowledge, intent or purpose may be inferred from objective factual circumstances. Proposed new subsection (2) provides that this `is not intended to exclude or limit any other way of proving knowledge, intent or purpose as an element of an offence for the purposes of a prosecution'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our concern is that the provision of this new section may be contrary to a series of High Court decisions to the effect that there is always a presumption that mens rea is required before a person can be found guilty of a serious criminal offence. Under the test proposed in section 8A, the prosecution would not need to prove that the accused knew that his or her conduct was unlawful. The prosecution would only need to prove that the accused ought to have known that the conduct was unlawful. It introduces an objective test for establishing the accused's state of mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the other place, my colleague the shadow Attorney-General referred in his speech on the second reading to the High Court decision in the 1988 case of Pereira, in which it was held that the necessary mental element could be inferred from the circumstances but only with three qualifications: firstly, the question remains one of actual knowledge; secondly, the question is that of the actual knowledge of the accused; and, thirdly, where knowledge is inferred from the circumstances surrounding the commission of the alleged offence, knowledge must be the only rational inference available. The coalition is concerned that these qualifications do not appear in proposed section 8A. The impression may therefore be given that the Parliament has decided to displace the application of Pereira. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, in the July 1990 report of the review of Commonwealth criminal law, it was recommended that the minimum fault element for a criminal offence should be recklessness. The Opposition takes the view that the requisite mental element should at least be recklessness. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General, Mr Duncan, argued in the other place that proposed section 8A does not offend against existing principles of liability. A court must be satisfied as to actual knowledge or intent on the part of the defendant. As was made clear in the case of Pereira, such knowledge or intention may be inferred from proven objective circumstances. He went on to say that he entirely accepted the considerations set out in Pereira to be observed in making use of such evidence and he had no doubt that a court, in construing proposed section 8A(1), would apply the test as set out in that case. The coalition does not believe that the matter is as clear as Mr Duncan claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I therefore foreshadow that the Opposition will be opposing clause 4A at the committee stage, as we did in the other place. Apart from the concerns that I have mentioned, the coalition supports the Bill, as we do all measures against drug trafficking. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, this is a different area. I will be brief. I did not hear what Senator Hill said, but no doubt he was reflecting the concerns that I have. The Crimes (Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Amendment Bill 1992 aims to amend the Crimes (Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Act 1990 and to further implement the 1988 United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. While the 1990 Act puts in place the Federal legislative framework to enable ratification of the 1988 convention, the 1992 Bill is intended to apply Federal legislation to the commission of State and Territory offences and place Australia in a position to ratify the convention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia became a signatory to the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs in 1961. This was later amended by the Protocol Amending the Single Convention in 1972, and the Convention on Psychotropic Substances in 1971. The Psychotropic Substances Act 1976 gives effect to Australia's obligations under the psychotropic substances convention by regulating movement on psychotropic substances. As Senator Hill has said, the coalition supports this legislation, as it supports any endeavours in the war against drugs, particularly at an international level. It is the level of international movement of and dealings in drugs that impinges very greatly on drug activity in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this legislation is to set in place the final stage of the legislative framework to meet the obligations under the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. Australia can now proceed to the ratification of the convention. As I said earlier, the Bill fills in the gaps between State and Territory legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a few matters that are of consequence to me. The first is that we are introducing this legislation and dealing with it prior to the States and Territories completing their complementary legislative programs. It is not clear to me which States have not fulfilled their obligations, to the extent that they are obligations, and the reasons for the delays. It is least clear to me to what extent there has been unanimity among, and support by, the States for the necessary legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter is that a serious crime under State legislation is an indictable offence carrying a minimum penalty of 12 months imprisonment. There are many offences that carry that penalty. I wonder, as does the coalition, whether that minimum threshold is too low for the purposes of triggering an offence under this Act and whether it ought to be higher&mdash;perhaps at least five years&mdash;given that this legislation will provide penalties of up to 20 years in gaol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought I heard Senator Hill discussing my third concern; that is, the proof of knowledge, which has changed. It has moved from a position where a reasonable person may have known an offence was being committed to one where an objective examination of the facts would show that somebody ought to have known that an offence was being committed. In other words, a person can be involved in an offence without knowing it, and then we have this draconian legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am always concerned, with legislation of this nature, that we suspend the normal standards, measures and tests of law because we believe that the crime is so serious that it deserves different attention&mdash;whether it be taxation matters, drug matters or white collar crime matters. The test should not change because of a perceived social attitude towards a particular offence, or because politicians and parliamentarians believe that there is some advantage for themselves or that they are, for the moment, reflecting the contemporary view of the community. It is incumbent upon this Parliament to ensure that the minimum tests and criteria are applied. With those qualifications, I join with Senator Hill in supporting the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The States and Northern Territory Grants (Rural Adjustment) Amendment Bill 1992 gives effect to changes made to the rural adjustment scheme&mdash;the RAS, as it is commonly known&mdash;through an agreement between the Commonwealth and the States. Under section 27 of the Act, these amendments can be introduced prior to an amendment of legislation to allow much faster assistance for farmers who are in dire financial straits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rural adjustment scheme has become an elastic bandaid, a means by which the Government can hide its successive failures. Unfortunately, the bandaid has now failed and the rural adjustment scheme really is in need of major surgery if it is to address the problems that will confront agriculture in the next five to 10 years. We do not need another bandaid added to the already overburdened rural adjustment scheme, which is trying to cope with the problems in rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Testament to the failure of the rural adjustment scheme is the fact that, of the $10m set aside this financial year to assist farmers to gain the unemployment benefit through the modification of the Job Search allowance, only $200,000 has been expended at this stage. This Government cannot even spend the allocated money on a very specific, targeted assistance project. Why not? Farmers are also asking why not. It is because of poor policy making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), along with the now fallen Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Richardson, promised on 29 October last year that 2,000 desperate farmers would receive assistance through the Government's reformed Job Search allowance. At the end of April, the number of farmers who were granted Job Search under the modified assets test arrangement totalled 101. Honourable senators will remember that in October last year 2,000 farmers were going to receive this targeted assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After considering the criteria for eligibility, the question is not why so few farmers took up the offer but why so many farmers did not meet such unrealistic and unbelievable requirements. The Job Search allowance does need modification if this targeted assistance is to work and be directed to those very deserving farmers in desperate straits right now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rural adjustment scheme is broken down into three components: part A, the interest subsidy component; part B, carry-on finance; and part C, household support and money to adjust out of farming. In order to be eligible for the Government's so-called farmer dole, the applicant must have not further borrowing capacity and must be considered viable in the long term. I am not sure how a farmer would meet both those criteria. If a farmer is to be viable in the long term, he or she is ineligible for the interest subsidy and forfeits any chance of accessing the unemployment benefit. Who then qualifies for the amended Job Search allowance? All available evidence suggests that the benefit will be granted only in quite exceptional circumstances. I believe that the fact that 101 farmers are receiving this assistance is testimony to that assertion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us suppose for a moment that the Government's amended Job Search allowance did assist 2,000 farmers instead of the paltry 101 farmers who are receiving it now. Less than 4 per cent of farmers qualify for the unemployment benefit in the worst year on record for farm incomes and in the worst drought in many parts of the country since records have been kept. It is not hard to deduce from such figures that the Government's assistance program has failed completely. It has failed so many desperate farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put this failure down to the complete misunderstanding&mdash;perhaps ignorance&mdash;of this Labor Government. It does not understand the Australian farm sector, and I believe that it does not want to understand it. If it did, this problem would have been addressed prior to Christmas last year. Had those in government listened to this side of the House and taken on board our proposals, this situation could have been averted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments within this Bill also provide special assistance for crop planting. This assistance has been made available since March this year under part B of the scheme. This assistance is in the form of a 75 per cent interest subsidy on growers' commercial crop planting loans. It is certainly long overdue. Under the terms of the agreement with the States, farmers must be profitable in the long term but be unable to obtain sufficient commercial carry-on finance to undertake normal cropping programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures to date show that only 160 out of an estimated 40,000 cereal and grain farmers across Australia have applied for the subsidies to help with winter wheat plantings due to the stringent requirements. Many of them have been through the process already. They have been in to see their bankers and rural adjustment authorities. In many cases, even the rural adjustment authorities are saying, `Look, you are better off going in and dealing with your bank. There is so much red tape, I do not think you will qualify. You are really wasting your time and effort and that of your accountants in putting these figures together'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These figures confirm what we are saying about this scheme. Of 160 applicants, 67 have been approved, 29 have been rejected and 64 are still pending. In fact, the disregard of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for the problems forced on the rural sector was illustrated in his February economic statement when he allocated almost twice as much money to Western Australian sewage treatment as to the crop planting assistance program this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking about an export industry which has the capacity to generate $2 billion to $3 billion worth of export income and create countless jobs right across Australia&mdash;not just on the farms, but on the wharves where the wheat is loaded, the railways which cart the wheat into the ports and for the truck drivers who bring it in from the farms. It is a great creator of jobs, yet so little of this assistance is flowing to the wheat and cereal growers of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's message is quite clear: in times of financial crisis, welfare payments cannot be extended to farming communities through unemployment benefits. Generally, the farmer and his spouse are actively employed on the property from daybreak to dusk, regardless of whether they receive any income. It is, therefore, not practical to offer the Job Search allowance as a means of assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need for fast track household support reform is, therefore, crucial if farming families are to keep food on the table and if the rural infrastructure is to survive this very desperate period. A coalition government would allow farmers to access the same benefits as every other Australian. The coalition recognises that there is a role for rural adjustment in Australia in order to assist the Australian agricultural sector in overcoming problems unique to it. We recognise the need for rural adjustment; there will probably always be a need for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are lots of other problems that I think the Government must look at. It certainly must look at encouraging farmers to better manage their situations prior to drought. One of the reasons why we have a rural adjustment scheme in place is that there is a lack of programs&mdash;programs which the coalition had in place to encourage farmers to put money aside in good times to see their way through the bad times and, more particularly, through the droughts. In many cases, the Government has taken such measures away. It is something that we must look at more closely and the Government must look at it because it obviously has the power of the Treasury bench. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another aspect of this whole question of rural adjustment that I hope the Minister will look at. Rural adjustment has been added to, yet some of the problems that are still inherent in rural Australia are problems that rural adjustment cannot cover adequately. These include income equalisation deposits and the 100 per cent write-offs for drought mitigation measures for the storage of fodder, for increased water storage capacity and for the reticulation of water around farms in order to avoid many of the disasters that we have seen in the current drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast to the Government, the coalition does have an understanding of the rural sector. It can solve the great many problems facing rural Australia today. We would be in there restoring farm profitability through the implementation of a comprehensive tax reform and economic package, the like of which this country has never seen. We would have an effective industrial relations policy which would give reward for effort, which every Australian wants. We would encourage people to work. The more people worked and the harder they worked, the more they would earn to take home to their families. We would do that rather than continue the restrictive work practices that Government members have encouraged and nurtured for years and years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I ask the Minister to look at the real problems confronting so many farming families right across Australia. We may have seen a return to better prices for some commodities, but the problem that many farm families face today is one of walking off their farms with nothing to show for a lifetime's work. I believe it is up to each and every one of us in this chamber and the House of Representatives to look at how better to target the Job Search allowance and the whole rural adjustment scheme in order to assist those who are in genuine need. </PARA>

One of the sayings in the bush at the moment is that giving your child the family farm is the ultimate form of child abuse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This rural adjustment package is the second attempt&mdash;an unsuccessful attempt&mdash;by the new Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) to produce a package that he believed would be helpful to the farmers of Australia. Unfortunately, as we told him in the debate last year, this package was too immersed in red tape and would not get to all the people out there who require help. That has been very adequately demonstrated by Senator Tambling's contribution to the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill extends benefits already available throughout the States, the Northern Territory and the ACT. That is really a simple administrative matter. The second amendment relates to the provision of assistance for short term problems caused by drought and high interest rates, and that assistance is by way of an interest subsidy for crop planting. The third amendment relates to that crop planting scheme, announced in Prime Minister Keating's One Nation economic statement. An amount of $21m was to be provided for a crop planting scheme to assist, it was estimated, 4,000 cereal and grain farmers, and there was also some provision for hard-pressed sugarcane growers. It was a sort of poor-man's guaranteed minimum price scheme&mdash;a way to have a guaranteed minimum price scheme when we did not really have such a scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This planting scheme was introduced at a time when the rural industry was facing very low commodity prices. Trade subsidies were distorting the price of grain, dropping it to $90 or $80 a tonne in the farmer's hands about a year ago. Last year it went up to about $140 a tonne in the grower's hands, when the cost of production was around $150 a tonne. Trade distortions, coupled with very high interest rates of around 27 per cent, have caused massive problems for farmers, and these farmers were then hit again with drought. This scheme was the Government's response to help farmers out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know whether Senator Tambling mentioned the figures; if he did I will repeat them. There were 356 applications for a 75 per cent interest subsidy; 196 have been approved; 103 have been rejected and 57 are pending. That would indicate there are probably around 200 or 300 people growing grain who need financial assistance. I can assure the Senate there are many more people in absolutely desperate need of assistance. But, as Senator Tambling pointed out, when the farmers turn to the rural adjustment scheme&mdash;although the people administering it, I must admit, have been very helpful and have tried to do their best to provide assistance through the scheme&mdash;they are told that the gate is just too narrow, the red tape is too deep. Getting into the scheme would require an accountant to prepare an immense set of figures, and that is expensive too. People generally appreciate that it is much better to throw themselves at the mercy of their bank managers and increase their debt rather than chase this scheme around in circles. As I say only 196 applications have been approved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We told the Minister that at the time he was introducing the scheme. In fact, we pointed out that the rural adjustment scheme was never meant to be a social welfare scheme. The Government has put the rural adjustment scheme in the too hard basket: when nothing else can help farmers, push it into the rural adjustment scheme and let the States administer it. Some States interpret the scheme differently from other States. The scheme has been a monumental failure, although I believe the Minister did intend to make it work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It reminds me of another scheme that we put in place for desperate farmers at the closing stages of the last Budget session&mdash;Job Search. I can recall when we wanted to move amendments the Minister, Senator Richardson, telling us that if we failed to pass the legislation to make destitute farmers eligible for Job Search&mdash;and Senator Tambling would remember this&mdash;2,000 farmers would be on the door the next day waiting for the Job Search allowance to come through and be it on our heads that these 2,000 farmers would be deprived of getting the Job Search allowance. In his speech, the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think all honourable senators should understand that if some of those amendments which we will cover tonight are passed, they will be rejected in the House of Representatives and the package will not be ready for a couple of thousand farmers who want it to be available on Monday.</PARA>
<PARA>We argued for our amendments and we stuck with them. I remember Senator Alston had the passage of the Bill at the time. But as usually happens in this chamber&mdash;in about 99 cases out of 100&mdash;we stand up for rural Australia, reach a decision, go to the Australian Democrats and argue our case, they agree with us, and then they come in here and collapse under the pressure of some implied threat. It does not happen once; it happens every time. We see it time after time. We have seen it this week probably more than we have ever seen it before: the Democrats collapsed on industrial relations and they collapsed on superannuation. They also collapsed this time last year on the wool Bill when we required a 10 per cent levy, the Government wanted 15 per cent, and the Democrats settled for 12 per cent. That cost farmers an immense amount of money. We were right. About a 9 per cent levy would have actually been required. But the Democrats came in here and, once again, let rural Australia down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our criticism of that legislation was very well founded. There was $10m allocated to that scheme to assist 2,000 farmers. But let us look at what in reality did happen. We received 134 applications or 134 applicants have managed to receive Job Search under the modified assets test. At the same date, only a little over $200,000 has been spent of that $10m scheme. So again we have seen the Minister trying to help farmers but hopelessly underestimating what rural adjustments would deliver. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not criticise the Minister for trying to do what he believed was right but I do criticise him for holding out a carrot of hope for farmers, for lifting their expectation that they will be eligible for some assistance, and then going in and pulling the rug right out from under them. It has happened twice. Here we have a rural adjustment scheme being provided for 4,000 farmers, and about 150 have received assistance. Last year we saw another scheme that was going to help 2,000 farmers, and 134 people have been successful in receiving assistance. That means that $200,000 has been spent out of an allocation of $10m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should be looking at that legislation to see where it has failed, but we are not. We just go on and bring in another Bill. The guidelines are so inflexible and complicated that they are a nightmare for the applicants. Not only are they a nightmare for the applicants, but they are also a nightmare for the people who process those applications. I am told that when an application gets through, everyone in the Department cheers because it is so unexpected. The people in the Department are actually trying but the guidelines are so narrow that it is like a camel trying to go through the eye of a needle. So the benefits are not flowing on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rural adjustment package was never designed as a social security measure but this Government has used it as such. It has turned the rural adjustment scheme into a bandaid scheme to apply some mythical remedies to the problem. Job Search for farmers has been a disaster and that is evidenced by the fact that although $10m was allocated to help 2,000 farmers, only 134 farmers have received any benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rural adjustment scheme has not reached the people it was designed to help. This is what we should be looking at now&mdash;widening this Bill to reach the people out there who are desperate. I have spoken to some of the people on the Darling Downs, the farm support groups, some belonging to the churches, and I have found that some farmers there are now reliant on food packages. What is happening in Australia is a terrible indictment on the Government. To live, some of our farmers have to rely on food packages handed out by the church or by advisers and community helpers who are financed through the State Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the coalition will have a massive job fixing some of the problems this Government has caused through high interest rates. There are also problems that have not been of the Government's making, one of which is the terrible subsidy war that is causing depressed prices throughout the world. That is not something this Government is responsible for; it is a world event that this Government has had little chance to do anything about. Nevertheless, it is a fact of life that we face terrible trade subsidies right throughout the world. In fact, subsidies on primary industry around the world now amount to $421 billion. Those are the problems that the Government is not addressing and which we must address, as the next coalition Government, in six or seven months time. </PARA>

Only two days ago the Finn review said that most of the crop planting in the eastern States is complete and even in Western Australia it is 80 per cent complete. I do not quite believe that, but Western Australia is the slowest starting State this year because of the weather. It did not rain much from 25 April until last week. The rest of Australia is supposed to be nearly completed, and here we are putting through legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know the second reading speech of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) says that the money has been available, but I would like to know how much is available. I cannot speak for the eastern States, but the general form of RAFCOR in Western Australia has been that it grants money for planting&mdash;to buy seed and fuel or, as in this case, superphosphate&mdash;around June, which is late, and, if planting is done then, the chances of getting a good crop come down. The point I make is that, if crop planting was contained in the March 1992 statement, then the legislation should have been introduced far earlier than now, when it is lost in the heap of Bills that have just been introduced in the last couple of weeks. </PARA>

<PARA>The summary is a result of what I think has been an interesting and quite productive process undertaken by the Committee. In effect, the Committee was acting as a catalyst in organising debate around the draft second Bill, which deals in the main with directors' duties, loans to directors, the question of insolvency and some other matters that ended up not being controversial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we went around the country hearing from practitioners in the area, we had with us Mr Phillip Noonan from the Attorney-General's Department, who listened to everything that was said, took copious notes and has the transcripts at his disposal, so that he is now in a position to advise the Attorney-General's Department and the Attorney-General on changes that the industry sees as being necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The process worked better than the Attorney-General Department's own attempts at practitioner workshops, because it was seen as the protagonist in what was to some unpopular legislation and it became the subject of personal attack when it held its practitioner workshops in Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide. We went to Perth, Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne and were seen as an independent body which was able to look more objectively and impartially at the whole question. As a result, the level of debate was far more constructive and less personal. The quality of the written and verbal submissions were uniformly high, despite the fact that in some cases not very long notice was given. I commend those who participated in the process for the quality of those submissions. I and the Committee found it a most interesting experience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was also heartened&mdash;and I think the Committee was too&mdash;by the commitment of the Attorney-General early in the process to revisit the legislation and his commitment to make sure that it is rewritten thoroughly so that it does take account of some of the suggestions that have been made by those practitioners in the field. I commend also the Attorney-General's Department itself for its willingness to participate in the process and its apparent willingness to really look seriously at sensible amendments to the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will be going through a similar process in relation to the Close Corporations Act which was passed by the Parliament but has never been proclaimed because of some constitutional difficulties. The Committee will take that Bill around the country in much the same way, but, in addition, in that case we will be looking at a very thorough rewrite to make it a much simpler Act than it is currently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It deals with small business and has to be understood by small business, which is less likely than the larger corporations to be able to seek legal advice. With the Close Corporations Act we will be repeating the process that we have just engaged in with the second draft of the corporations Bill. I commend that process to the Senate as a very useful mechanism. We are looking forward to that exposure in August and September of this year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I recognise the significance of your comment. I would also like to congratulate the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) for allowing the Corporate Law Reform Bill 1992 to lie on the table, for allowing opportunities for people who are practising in this area to express their views both to the Attorney-General's office and to our Committee, and for his commitment to the reform of that legislation. I was delighted to read in one of today's newspapers that in a press release the Attorney-General has foreshadowed a major review of company law to make it simpler and easier to understand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of the witnesses who came before us would support that proposal wholeheartedly, as would the members of the Committee. That is not to say that the task will be easy. This relatively short paper&mdash;in comparison with the volume of legislation that the Committee looked at&mdash;has been prepared to enable honourable senators to understand some of the major problems which confront companies and directors of companies in today's corporate law area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr John Green, a partner in Freehill, Hollingdale and Page in Sydney, has said that there has been a fundamental shift and we are going the wrong way with regard to our company law in that, instead of directors assessing whether the company should do something and how that would benefit the company, they are now asking themselves whether the company will go on to do a particular thing and, if so, what will be the personal risk attached to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, it is a matter of grave concern that, with our desperate need to become internationally competitive, directors of companies in Australia are not able to think of ways whereby a company can progress itself forward without constantly worrying about covering their backsides, if I might use that expression, to ensure that they do not end up being prosecuted for some offence in relation to the massive and extensive corporate legislation by one of the many agencies that have been established to supervise it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That then leads us to the very difficult question of whether the law should be what is called black letter law or whether it should be fuzzy law. Differences of opinion have been expressed in that area by witnesses who came before the Committee. The solution to that might very well lie with the Victorian Law Reform Commission, which is coming up with principles of parliamentary legislative drafting which I think have great merit. Those principles rest upon the idea that the first sentence of a clause of a Bill will express the purpose of that clause&mdash;what that clause is hoping to achieve. All subclauses of that clause will be in relation to the primary statement&mdash;the principles set out in the first clause. The legislation may even use examples to explain what is meant by the principle which is established in the first paragraph of the particular clause or part of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there will be enormous advantages to all of us if parliamentary draftsmen can go down that road. Our Committee is looking at doing something along those lines with regard to the Close Corporations Act. I hope that we will be able to demonstrate to the Parliament the major benefits of this procedure when we bring the Close Corporations Act before the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to say how much I appreciated the evidence given to us by many of the witnesses and the problems that they raised with us. During the last day of Committee hearings in Melbourne one of the most significant things that were raised was the fact that Australian corporations law seems to be getting out of line with our international competitors. That means that some international companies will not register to trade in Australia because of the difficulties of our corporations law and because of the consequences for directors of their companies under Australian corporate law. We must always be careful that, in our concerns about what has happened with corporations in the last decade, we do not get to the stage where Australian corporations law is so far out of kilter with international corporations law that it is to the detriment of this nation's trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have only a couple of minutes left. The only other matter I wish to raise is the question of disclosure&mdash;in particular, the disclosure of loans to directors. There are many paragraphs in the Bill dealing with loans to directors. One of our witnesses said that, when he read these clauses in relation to loans to directors, he threw up his hands in horror and said, `As far as I'm concerned, in my companies there will be no further loans to directors'. I can well understand him adopting that approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that could very well be a major problem which ought not to be allowed. For example, clearly some executive directors ought to be given loans to enable them to purchase their homes in relocated sites. For example, if a chief executive officer was relocated from Adelaide, where the price of housing is relatively low, to Sydney, where home prices are very high, as part of that person's executive salary package he or she ought to be granted a substantial loan to enable him or her to purchase a home in Sydney. That should be available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that I wish to raise is that, whilst the companies are talking about the difficulties in these areas, none of them are making voluntary disclosures. I suggest that some of our public companies ought to see that there would be much merit in making voluntary disclosure of all sorts of information in regard to their directors and executive directors such as the size, details and specifics of loans which have been made to directors, the salaries that have been paid and any other perks of office. I am sure that if some companies were to show the way in this regard&mdash;in other words, with full voluntary disclosure&mdash;those companies may very well find themselves much more successful on the stock exchange than the present situation where most companies simply reveal the information which they are required to reveal under the statutory requirements of our corporations legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to join the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of our Committee, the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities, in congratulating and thanking those people who provided evidence during our hearings. As Senator Beahan, the Chairman of the Committee, said, the written evidence and the oral evidence that the Committee took in Perth, Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne was of a uniformly high standard. It added to the Committee members' understanding of the complex nature of this legislation, of the law reform task and of the problems faced by the business community and the professional community in dealing with this extremely complicated and, indeed in some places, onerous legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Lewis has pointed out, one of the most concerning matters was highlighted in our Melbourne hearings on the last day of our around Australia bandwagon&mdash;the matter of international competitive advantage. Even though it was reflected in all of the other hearings, it was put very well by one of the witnesses in Melbourne that Australia is in an international environment, corporations are increasingly international in focus, trans-global, trans-national corporations, and that Australia should, particularly in the South East Asian region, be trying to attract its fair share of head offices to the capital cities of Australia to increase Australia's employment chances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Evidence was given that New Zealand, for example, had looked at the Australian model and had rejected it. In Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and South East Asia generally, Australia's governance of corporations was seen to be far too onerous, far too black letter and far too heavily regulated. Australia was seen as having slipped behind in this important area of legislation and international competitive advantage because of the black letter, prescriptive approach that corporations legislation has taken in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we are looking at this so-called corporate law reform Bill, we note that it is going even further. The overwhelming weight of the evidence, which is well summarised in this document, shows that this over-regulated approach is strongly rejected by the business community, by the company directors, by the business people and, of course, by the professionals who have to deal with the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The overwhelming comment was that directors, officers of companies, people who have to deal and comply with this corporations law, can no longer do so because it is so complicated and so weighty that it is almost impossible to understand. If it is impossible to understand the law, it is very hard to comply with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the final points I wanted to make, in the very short time I have remaining to me, relates to the approach of compliance, and to the costs of compliance to business in Australia. We hear in this place day after day about the sorts of burdens faced by the business community in complying with taxation legislation and all sorts of other government legislative requirements. This proposed law reform contains a massive increase in the paper compliance cost to business, particularly in relation to the disclosure of loans to directors and transactions between related companies. Indeed, this legislation calls for immediate disclosure of all such transactions. One of the matters raised all around Australia was: how can the Australian Securities Commission, firstly, deal with the information that it will be receiving and, secondly, what is the benefit to Australia generally, to the national interest, of disclosing all of this legislation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The summary of evidence shows that the business community and the professional community see a lot of this so-called law reform as unnecessary and as an over-reaction, not to a failure in the law&mdash;the point is well made in this evidence&mdash;but to a failure to enforce the law. One of the points that were made in Brisbane very clearly by company directors in that city was that there needs to be a moratorium on changes to this legislation because the business community has not come to grips with the enormous changes brought about with the establishment of the new centralised scheme and the  Australian Securities Commission just over a year ago. It was felt that there should be a moratorium on change so that the Australian business community can come to grips with the legislation we have already. The Joint Statutory Committee, of which Senator Beahan is the Chairman, has played a vital role in raising the level of debate on these issues. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the aviation policy, there are no problems about that at all. I think it is a very good policy. With any  major structural change of that kind there are issues of implementation which have to be carried out, and I am sure they will be. On the issue of whether either of those policies will reduce unemployment or create unemployment, the answer is that I believe that when the pay television system is implemented it will create employment in Australia.

I further ask the Minister, in relation to the management by the Sisters of Mercy of this new hospital, whether it is of concern that the approval of the Sisters of Mercy as the managers of the hospital at its present location in East Melbourne has occurred at a time when many of the procedures which are not going to be available in their Werribee hospital, were not even available.

Indeed, as has been mentioned by Senator Powell and me, the Sisters of Mercy operate the Mercy Hospital for Women at East Melbourne, presumably with the same restrictions on the types of services that it is prepared to offer. That has been part of the public hospital system. It has been part of the arrangements undertaken between Victoria, the Commonwealth and the Sisters of Mercy over several years. This is nothing new. I am advised that such services are available within a reasonable time for those who live at Werribee and who wish to avail themselves of those services.

Before I was rudely interrupted outside of Standing Orders by Senator Bishop, I was saying that the main features of the New Zealand industrial relations model are the formal abolition of the arbitration commission and the complete phase-out of awards in New Zealand. As awards expire, they are abolished and replaced with employment contracts, negotiated between employees and employers. Even if employees want unions to negotiate for them, employers can refuse to negotiate with their unions and insist on negotiating with each individual worker.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New Zealand industrial relations legislation provides for a minimum wage for full time adult workers&mdash;but it is a very low minimum. It is about $A175 a week or $A9,000 per annum at current exchange rates. For employees who are under 20 years of age, there is no minimum wage protection at all. Other conditions and payments&mdash;such as hours of work, penalty rates, shift arrangements and any other allowances&mdash;must also be negotiated with the employer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important to note that in concomitant social security changes, workers who resign or refuse job offers cannot qualify for unemployment benefits for six months. This has dramatically further reduced the bargaining power of employees in dealing with employers. An employer can force a wage cut onto workers; if the worker refuses to take the cut and leaves the job, he or she will not qualify for the dole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I go back to the debate about young workers which is about to beset us after lunch. There is no minimum wage at all for young workers in New Zealand. An employer can insist on paying a young worker below the level of the dole. If the young worker does not then accept the rate below the dole, he or she is cut off from unemployment benefits for six months. That is supposed to be a system of equity, fairness and security.

But, even with that qualification, it shows that just over half of the employees had their ordinary time, real wages frozen or they suffered a reduction.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. It follows the question asked of him by Senator Pat Giles in respect of New Zealand's industrial relations. I draw Senator Cook's attention to the strike at Hamersley Iron in his own State of Western Australia which involves more than 2,000 workers and which threatens to become the biggest at Hamersley Iron in almost a decade&mdash;a strike caused by a worker's refusal to join the Metal and Engineering Workers Union. I ask the Minister: does he support the right of workers in Australia to contract their labour to employers without being threatened, intimidated, bullied or coerced into joining a union? Does he agree with the union organiser, John Mossenton, that the worker is a parasite on society and has inflicted pain on his fellow workers as well as the reputation of Hamersley, all for the $160 membership which is tax deductible anyway?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are, of course, very consistent on the subject of industrial disputes. This is an industrial dispute, as I understand it, in the Pilbara about whether a person should be a member of a union or not. The view I express about that dispute is that the proper place for it to be settled is the Industrial Relations Commission and that it is not appropriate that there be any disruption of production at Hamersley Iron if there is a grievance to be settled over this issue of union membership. I say that because it is my understanding that the agreements&mdash;these are not awards&mdash;concluded between Hamersley Iron and its work force provide preference for union membership and it is something that both parties, Hamersley Iron and its work force, have agreed on. We now have a dispute over whether the provision of the agreement&mdash;this is the parties interacting together, not with the presence of a third party&mdash;is being properly handled. Whether it is or it is not, it should go to the Arbitration Commission to be settled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since Senator Crichton-Browne's introduction was about New Zealand, let me draw a comparison. What I said in my answer about New Zealand was that the first thing the Employment Contracts Act did was abolish the arbitration commission in New Zealand and terminate the awards of that commission. If that were transmogrified across the Tasman to Australia, it would mean that there would be no umpire to settle the dispute over an agreement between an employer and its employees. The dispute would rage unchecked without there being a chance to settle it by going to the merits of the case and it could only then be settled by going to who is the strongest industrial power&mdash;the employer, in this case, or the union. That is exactly what the arbitration system proposes to circumvent; it proposes to concentrate on the merits of the issue rather than the industrial strength of the parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am asked whether I support the remarks Senator Crichton-Browne has said are attributed to Mr Mossenton. I understand the chagrin of union members when they pay for the negotiations of an agreement and then other people come along later, without making a contribution, and take up the advantage that has been achieved by that negotiation. But I do not think the chagrin is sufficient to cause this disruption of production and, as I say, the matter should go to the Arbitration Commission for settlement.</PARA>

Senator Cook has not told us whether he believes in voluntary unionism or not. He has not told us whether or not he believes in the right of individuals to contract their labour with employers. What he has told us is that this is a good example of unions and corporations doing deals and the last consideration is the workers. I ask Senator Cook: does he support the Western Australian Industrial Relations Act, which makes it an offence to dismiss a worker on the ground of union membership; or does he support the Western Australian Labor Minister for Industrial Relations, who is on the side of the union and the workers and contrary to the interest of this particular worker?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If there were a logical base or a logical thread here it would help in this discussion. The reason why a person cannot be dismissed on the ground of union membership as a provision of the Act is to prevent people from being victimised because they join a trade union, which is not the way in which Senator Crichton-Browne in this question has tried to present the facts. It is my understanding that the company is arguing that the agreement it has entered into is superseded by a provision not in the arbitration Act but in another Act about non-discrimination. It seems to me that if that is the case in point it ought to go before the umpire for the umpire to rule whether an agreement between the parties can be superseded by a provision in another Act, and whether that provision is in fact relevant to these circumstances. It is not for me to take a position on who is right or wrong about that. The parties should present their case and have it determined.</PARA></TALK.START>

If Senator Crichton-Browne could understand these basic and fundamental points of industrial law and come to grips with them, then perhaps he would understand how erroneous, wrong and misleading are a lot of the allegations that are made by his shadow spokesman, Mr John Howard, about industrial relations performance in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Reynolds, by her question, gives an impression that a decision has been taken which ought to be reviewed. It has to be emphasised that no decision has been taken on the request, I understand, by wholesale tour operators, mostly in Queensland, that a number of Japanese be brought in in order to act as tourist guides for the great influx of Japanese tourists, particularly into Queensland, but to other parts of Australia also. It has to be said very firmly that no decision has been taken on that application. But I do believe that it is very important to indicate that the consultations which are essential before such an agreement is reached are being undertaken, and they are being undertaken by the trade union movement, by the tour operators and by various Federal government departments. This is not something which will be dictated to governments by tour operators. It is a matter which requires, as I have said, the fullest consultation with trade unions, which are of course concerned with protecting the employment prospects of their members and of those who might enter the work force as Australian members of their unions and others.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, it also must be emphasised that in discussions and consultations of this sort, the question of the undertakings by the industry itself to provide training and job opportunities for people to act as guides for tourists coming to Australia will be absolutely paramount. In the absence of such undertaking, no permission would be given; I can assure Senator Lewis of that. Labour agreements are all about providing training and employment opportunities to Australians. In fact, that sort of undertaking must be given by the industry before such visa applications will even be countenanced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Japanese-based travel companies and their wholesale operators here in Australia have put forward a proposal. As I say, that proposal has certainly not received assent by the Federal Government. It requires commitment by governments. Senator Reynolds mentions the Queensland Government being prepared to offer training programs to enable young Queenslanders to enter into this tourist guide activity and employment. That sort of commitment is a very recently announced interest of the Queensland Government. It is good that the Queensland Government is prepared to help train young Queenslanders to get those job opportunities. We certainly encourage that and we are quite prepared to speak to the Queensland Government in the context of these consultations.</PARA>

<PARA>The very essence of Senator Cook's answer highlighted all the concerns that we have expressed in respect of the recent legislation. The truth of the matter is that this dispute has been about the right of individual workers to seek employment without the need to be associated with a union. Senator Cook referred to the fact that a previous agreement was entered into between Hamersley Iron and the union. That is absolutely true. The agreement entered into by Hamersley Iron with the union was that preference would be given to unionists. That agreement is a classic example of an agreement entered into without consideration to individual rights. It is an agreement entered into in the interests of the union. The company agreed to it because it virtually had no choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the company used to do&mdash;as Senator Cook well knows&mdash;was that when a worker refused to join the union or resigned from the union during his term of employment, he was promptly sacked by the company, because the price of sacking the worker was cheaper than the company involving itself in industrial disputation. As the Minister well knows, the Act was amended and those amendments supersede the agreement of 1982. It is now an offence to dismiss a worker who is no longer a member of a union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notwithstanding the Act, the workers and the union, aided and abetted by the Labor Minister for Industrial Relations in Western Australia, embarked upon the largest strike in a decade at Hamersley Iron.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall speak only for the minute I asked for. I just say to Senator Cook, through you, Mr President, that this disputation in the Pilbara which is closing down a multimillion dollar industry, causing 2,000 men to be without pay, without income and, for the time being, without jobs, is not as a result of variations, interpretations and understandings of agreements or contracts. It is simply about one man's right to work without being bound to pay a union membership fee. This is a man who simply wants to work without being coerced, intimidated, threatened or caused in any circumstance to have to join a union for that right to work for a living. That is what this dispute is about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past the company has found it easier simply to sack people who had the courage to stand up and say, `I do not want to be in this union'. Those people were sacked, not because the company believed in it, not because the company wanted it, but because the company was prepared to pay that price for peace. As Senator Cook knows, subsequently the Western Australian arbitration Act was amended to make it an offence for companies to dismiss workers because they did not continue to be members of a union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This man has decided that he does not want to be a member of the union. He wants to get on with his life. He wants to go to work each day, free and unfettered from any coercion to join any association or any organisation. Mr Mossenton&mdash;this thug, this bully, this brute&mdash;describes this man who simply wants to go to work and mind his own business as a parasite on society. Mr Mossenton blames him for inflicting pain on his fellow workers as well as on the reputation of Hamersley Iron, as he calls it. This is Mr Mossenton's understanding of freedom, liberty and rights. He says, `All for a $160 membership, which is tax deductible anyway'. Mr Mossenton has boiled down this man's right to work, this man's right to dissociate himself from the union, this man's right to go about his ordinary daily affairs without being intimidated on this: all it is about is $160 which is tax deductible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has not occurred to this union official&mdash;who, by the way, lives on the $160 that is taken out of the workers' pay packets&mdash;that there is something grander than the contemplation of $160 a year membership fee; there is a finer ideal, a finer principle, a higher motive. It has not occurred to Mr Mossenton that this man simply wants the right not to join a union. This man wants to preserve the liberty of which this country has been so proud for so long. The price for this man standing up and having the courage to so do is that the billion dollar operation in the Hamersley Ranges in the Pilbara has closed down. The operations at Tom Price, Paraburdoo and Dampier have closed down simply because one man said, `I don't want to join your union'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that the fundamental objection the Opposition has to the Minister's legislation in respect of contractors is that it is an arrangement between employers and the unions. Senator Cook does not see a part in the world for the individual who wants to contract his own labour, his own skills, his own ability and his own endeavour directly, personally and privately to his employers. The problem with this legislation is that the Government is now taking away from ordinary, individual contractors their right to so contract their labour, their efforts or their enterprise. The Government sees the unions as corporate Australia&mdash;the two bigs get together and there is no room in between for the little man. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a time at the end of the last century when the Labor Party came together because it believed in the rights of the individual; it believed in the rights of individual people to work, to aspire, to gain rewards and to achieve their goals, aspirations, wishes and desires. Members of the Labor Party used to believe in that; that is why they came together and formed the Labor Party. That is where it got its name. Now it is corporate Australia. Its care is for that monolithic structure of a union movement that runs its daily life and agenda. That is why this country is in the mess that it is in, and that is why the Minister's once fine Party is in such disarray and decay. Tragically, the real price is being paid by the ordinary guy on the floor of the factory, the shop or the mine. </PARA>

I will address the issue of the rights of the individual, which is fundamental to our world view and our basic philosophy and is fundamental to this question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I turn to the substance of the subject, the reference made to contractors by Senator Crichton-Browne is, with due respect, ill-informed because there is no provision in that Bill that people need be members of a union at all. The only provision is that, if people are working on a contract which is harsh and unfair, they have a means, easily and accessibly, to have that contract reviewed. I would have thought that is a principle of the right of the individual. If people are victims of a harsh and unfair contract, they ought to be able to have a means by which, whether they are union members or not, they can have that contract reviewed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current Hamersley Iron dispute is a dispute that Australia does not need and that we ought not to have. I enjoin those unions involved in it to return to work and settle their differences directly with the company through the means of the Arbitration Commission. At lunchtime it was reported to me that, as we speak, there is a conference before Commissioner Fielding of the Western Australian Industrial Relations Commission to resolve the matter. He has indicated that should it not be resolved, he will order a settlement of the matter. This is the proper procedures of the Commission functioning. I make the point&mdash;although it is not germane to this debate&mdash;that, if the Opposition's industrial relations policy applied, the Commission would not be able to act in this way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After an investigation that I conducted over lunchtime, the circumstances of this dispute appear to me to be that Hamersley Iron reached an agreement with its unions on behalf of its employees in 1982. That agreement reflected, in the terms of the agreement concluded between the parties, a provision that, in order to work on Hamersley Iron sites, people had to be members of the relevant unions. That was an agreement entered into between the company and the unions. It may well be that people have various reasons, misgivings or qualifications about entering into an agreement, but there is no argument that this agreement was voluntarily entered into by the parties who are, therefore, bound by it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In December 1982, the Western Australian Industrial Relations Act was amended by the then Liberal Government. The provisions in the Act relating to the ability of registered industrial relations agreements to contain such a provision were removed. As a consequence, it seems plain that once the provisions of the Act are gone, ergo, so are the provisions of the agreement. That was the impact of that change to industrial law in Western Australia as I recall the debate in 1982. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it would seem that the agreements concluded between the parties were altered by government intervention in the law of industrial relations to prevent the parties concluding an agreement on this matter. As a consequence, between then and now the parties have managed their relationship harmoniously on this front and without disputation. Until now, some nine years later, I have not been aware of any dispute about this matter. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a different matter from the law. There are those who can distinguish between what is lawful and what is justice.

If people do not agree with the law and they take action outside it, they have to expect to be penalised.

He says that because this person wishes to accept and benefit from the particularly advantageous conditions negotiated by unions on behalf of their members&mdash;and the pay rises that will inevitably follow at a level more advantageous to the rest of the community&mdash;then that person has a right to do so irrespective of the collective rights of every other individual who works on that site and who has participated in the negotiation of those conditions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope the Government has a look at these figures when it is dealing with this matter. When the official figures released as a result of recent Australian Bureau of Statistics surveys of not only unemployment but also hidden unemployment and underemployment are added to the official unemployment figures, they show that one in every two 15- to 19-year-olds wanting to work is either unemployed or underemployed. That represents about one in every three of Australia's total youth population. That includes all those who are in full time education and who are not available for work. It deals with the very objection that Senator Cook and Mr Keating are making to the official statistics. One in three of the total youth population of Australia is either jobless or underemployed. Let Senator Button or anyone else deny those official ABS survey results. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This unemployment and underemployment rate for youths is far higher than the rate for adults on a similar basis, but let us recognise that adult employment is a disaster as well. We are concentrating on the youth unemployment situation because of the Government's campaign of deception in trying to tell the Australian public that because more young people are staying on at school, many of them funded by Austudy, to keep them out of the unemployment queues&mdash;it will have one effect: it will make better educated dole queues&mdash;therefore, the official figures put out by the Australian Bureau of Statistics are somehow no longer relevant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is also trying to pretend that things were even worse for teenagers in the 1983 recession. That is just self-evident bunkum. Let us look at the facts. There are now 26,000 more young people unemployed&mdash;that is including the hidden unemployed&mdash;than in the same month in 1983. There are now 75,000 more young people unemployed or underemployed than in 1983. The figures are clear, unequivocal, and cannot be denied, even by Mr Keating or Senator Cook with their remarkable ability to cook the books. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is how it has happened: the Government has cut the teenage work force since 1983 by about 50,000 by doing what, in many instances, will be a useful exercise&mdash;encouraging more and more young people to stay on longer at school and become better qualified. But this reduction in the teenage work force should have brought a massive reduction in competition for jobs and, therefore, a big cut in unemployment. That simply has not happened, because over that time the total number of young unemployed has only edged down by 1,000, yet there are 50,000 fewer of them in the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, what has happened is that over this time the number of full time jobs filled by 15- to 19-year-old Australians has been slashed by just under 200,000. Jobs have simply been wiped out. Some of them have been replaced by part time jobs. That is why the official unemployment rate has soared. It cannot be explained by the Government's structural changes to education. The reason youth unemployment has soared is that jobs have been decimated. This has been particularly so over the last two years of the recession we had to have. In fact, the unemployment situation was holding up reasonably well until the last couple of years and then, all of a sudden, there was decimation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The youth jobs crisis is turning into a catastrophe that is already even worse now for young people than in the Great Depression of the 1930s. By May this year, there were jobs available for one in every three 16- to 19-year-olds looking for full time work, and in Victoria and South Australia the official youth jobless rate hit a record-breaking 45 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if those who are prepared to put up with only part time work are included, the youth unemployment rate in May this year was almost 25 per cent&mdash;one in four. That is far higher than the comparable census figure of around 20 per cent in the Depression year of 1933. As a result of that, young Australians aged 15 to 19 now make up one in every five of Australia's total unemployed, compared with only one in seven in the middle of the Great Depression. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the latest official unemployment figures for 15- to 19-year-old Australians are the worst ever recorded, as I said earlier, they hide the hidden unemployed and underemployment that, according to recent ABS surveys, have lifted total youth unemployment and underemployment to 2 1/2 times the official jobless level. I say again, because the Government does not seem to have grasped this, that these official ABS surveys indicate that one in every two 15- to 19-year-olds wanting to work is either unemployed or underemployed&mdash;about one third or something like 426,000 of Australia's total youth population of 1.3 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the reality of the youth jobs disaster that the Federal Government pretends is not nearly as bad. We can see that, on the contrary, it is even worse. This is not simply because of the hidden unemployment and the underemployment that we can see; it also stems absolutely clearly from the decimation of youth jobs that has taken place during this recession we had to have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After seven years, during which time the number of full time teenage jobs had remained fairly constant, suddenly over two years of the recession, to May of this year, more than two in every five youth jobs were wiped out by this Government. The number of youth jobs slumped from about 410,000 to fewer than 250,000. Two years ago, 31 per cent of all 15- to 19-year-olds had full time jobs. That is not going back to the last recession; it is simply two years ago. Under this Government, that figure has been slashed: only 19 per cent of young people have full time jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 162,000 full time jobs that were lost over this time made up almost half of Australia's total of 366,000 full time jobs destroyed in the recession in the two years to May. So, although 15- to 19-year-olds make up only 5.6 per cent of Australia's full time labour force, they account for 44 per cent of all full time job losses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The young people of Australia are clearly in the firing line of Mr Keating's engineered recession&mdash;the recession that we had to have. With the population of young Australians aged 15 to 19 having fallen by about 75,000 over the past two years, in normal times the number of unemployed should also have fallen. Instead, it has jumped over the two years by something like 42,000 young people. Without this recession, job prospects should have improved considerably for 15- to 19-year-olds over these two years, as a slump in their numbers, as I said, should have reduced the competition for available jobs. The extension of Austudy to increasing numbers of students should have reduced that competition even further. In any event, the recent rises in youth unemployment go nowhere near accounting for the huge job losses of the last two years. The 40,000-odd lift in full time jobless to 125,000 in May this year represents less than a quarter of the total number of jobs lost over the last two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what has happened? These young Australians, who have disappeared from the unemployment statistics, dramatise the existence of an army of hidden youth unemployed who want jobs but who are excluded from the figures because they have given up trying, along with all those other underemployed young Australians who have to put up with inadequate part time work. We can see here that the figures do not include all these people. They do not include the people who work for more than one hour a week for nothing on their family farms or in their family businesses. These figures massively understate the horror&mdash;and yet this Government is going around pretending, for disgusting political purposes, that the figures somehow overstate the reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent ABS survey has shown that just under 100,000 15- to 19-year-olds are underemployed, giving an underemployment rate of about 13 per cent. Another figure for last September reveals that there are 160,000 or so who are not listed as unemployed but who would prefer to work and who would be available to work if jobs were available. Altogether, these Bureau of Statistics surveys show a total of officially unemployed and hidden unemployed of about 335,000. If the official underemployed are added in as well, you end up with a horrific total of about 435,000 young Australians, of whom, as I said earlier, one in every two want to work but are being denied the job opportunities they seek in the recession we had to have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a proportion of the total 15- to 19-year-old population, even including those in full time education who are not available for work, the figure represents one in every three young Australians. So the lost generation is no myth; it is a devastating reality, and there seems little hope that anything will happen to change this in the near future. It would take a 67 per cent rise in the total number of youth jobs to accommodate the 335,000 hidden unemployed, let alone the 100,000 underemployed, and there is no prospect of such an unprecedented rise in youth job opportunities under the present policies. Of course, there are opportunities under Fightback, but that is the only set of proposals that offers any hope to young Australians. Where will the jobs come from to cope with the remaining half a million young Australians who are, at present, simply pressing on with their studies in the hope of getting a job one day? For it is in the schools that today's submerged crisis is now building up to tomorrow's disaster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another serious problem is hidden in the recession's huge increase in the proportion of young Australians having to make do with part time work. Youth is also in the firing line of long term unemployment. Although 15- to 19-year-olds represent less than 10 per cent of the Australian population aged 15 and over, less than 9 per cent of the total labour force and only 5.6 per cent of the full time labour force, they account for 14 per cent of the number of long term unemployed&mdash;which is far greater than their proportion in either the work force or the population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pretending, as the Keating Government does, that the youth unemployment rate is around only 10 per cent, against the reality that one in every two 15- to 19-year-olds wanting to work and one in every three of the total youth population is either officially unemployed, in the hidden unemployed or underemployed may hide the problem, but it will do nothing to solve it. This may explain why the Government had done nothing to fix up this crisis which has been evident for the past 12 months until last week's belated call for yet another summit, another talkfest, another do-nothing option. At least this may mean that the Government has ceased believing its own propaganda and has at last recognised that this crisis must be resolved. Under Fightback and the Opposition's policies, it would be resolved. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will refer to Fightback. In responding to this problem, I want those opposite to understand that there are a number of things that the Government will not do. The Government will not introduce a 15 per cent tax on every item of food and clothing that unemployed people in this country buy; we will not put long term unemployed people into the gutter after nine months like the Opposition plans to do; we will not adopt the New Zealand scheme that the Opposition is so in love with because that scheme means that young people who do not accept a wage less than the appropriate unemployment benefit can be barred from benefits for six months; we will not introduce poverty wages; and we will not introduce a tax scale which tremendously favours the rich as against the relatively poor taxpayers. The Government is committed to addressing the youth unemployment issue, but let me talk a little bit about the issue first. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Baume went on about the figures. Unpalatable as it may be to him, as a very conservative man, seven out of 10 young Australians in the 15- to 19-year-old age group are either in education or employed. When this Government came to office, it was nothing like that figure. More young Australians are staying on in school than ever before. That is because with our education retention rates we seek to emulate the performance of countries like Japan and the United States. We have to do that if we are to be a successful economy which provides good, longer term employment in the future; that is, we have to have a better trained, better skilled work force than we have ever had before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is that when talking about this problem one has to begin to try to understand it. It is no good throwing around figures as if juggling balls in the air. The fact is, as Senator Baume well knows, that there is a high percentage&mdash;31 per cent; in some States 35 per cent or so&mdash;of young people in the 15 to 19 age group who are unemployed and looking for jobs; that is, about a third of them perhaps. But, still, more than two-thirds of young people in Australia who want to work have work. Senator Baume makes these sorts of glib references to underemployed people&mdash;underemployed people in education institutions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to mention one or two things which have happened. I referred to the safety net that we have in Australia which does not catch everybody&mdash;there are tragedies associated with youth unemployment. Part of that problem was addressed in the February government statement in terms of significant increases in the number of apprentice places and the provision of a further 10,000 pre-vocational training places for young people. A number of other matters were addressed in that February statement which try to alleviate this problem. We will not alleviate the problem by just putting people on the dole&mdash;or, as the Opposition would do, throwing them off the dole&mdash;but by trying to get them into productive activities in terms of training of one kind or another. </PARA>

The present Government is trying to grasp that nettle and say, `We will make funding arrangements for the TAFE sector on the condition that many of these arrangements are reformed'. There is enormous room for improvement in the vocational training sector provided by TAFE. I am not blaming State governments for its failures; I am just saying that it is an issue which has not been properly addressed until now because it has been very much in the hands of State governments and there are a variety of reasons why they have not addressed it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today on behalf of the Australian Democrats to support this very important matter of public importance debate about youth unemployment. Given that we have been debating this issue now for some 40 minutes, I think it is worth repeating to the Senate exactly what it is we are debating. The terms of the MPI are:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's refusal to acknowledge the extent of Australia's youth unemployment disaster which the Prime Minister is now trying to disguise, and its failure to take effective action to fix it.</PARA>
<PARA>I acknowledge Senator Button's earlier contribution that there are no easy answers to this problem. Nobody has the magic wand that will make this problem go away tomorrow. Much of the unemployment we are seeing in the Australian economy is structural. As I said this morning, many of the low-skilled and unskilled jobs that young people once did on leaving school at the age of 15 or 16 simply do not exist any more for them. So it is absolutely critical, in order for young people nowadays to take their part in the workplace, that training be given an absolutely high priority by this Government and to ensure that we are not simply leaving thousands and thousands of young people without hope and without jobs through lack of training opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> However, the statement on unemployment yesterday by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is, in our belief, simply face-saving rhetoric and an attempt on the part of the Government to paper over what is a very serious problem. It does not matter if unemployment is 10 per cent or 34 per cent amongst young people. The figures show that thousands of young people and thousands of older people are suffering. It is ridiculous and the height of arrogance for the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to suggest that the ABS figures are incorrect and not a true reflection of what is happening in society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday in the Senate I cited the latest OECD quarterly labour force statistics which compare Australia with our international trading partners. I was astonished, when I asked the Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook, whether he had seen these figures, to find that he had not. He was unable to provide any explanation to this Parliament as to why Australia is almost at the very top of this list. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will read out some of these figures because I think it is very instructive for honourable senators to hear them. At the top of the list, with the highest level of unemployment for young people between the ages of 14 and 24 years, is Italy, at 49.6 per cent. The next country is Portugal, with 41.5 per cent of its young people out of work. The third highest country is Switzerland&mdash;surprisingly&mdash;with 40.6 per cent of its young people out of work. However, Switzerland's figures are slightly different, as they have been calculated on the basis of the 15- to 30-year-old age group, which is slightly different from the Australian figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is next on the list with 38.8 per cent of its work force between the ages of 15 and 24 out of work. Those were figures, I would point out, from the last quarter of 1991, that is, six months ago. I am told that the next set of OECD labour market figures will be coming out in a month's time. I spoke to the Minister yesterday and expressed my surprise that he had not seen these figures. He assured me that he would make sure that these labour market figures were put on the top of his reading in his office. I certainly hope that he has an opportunity to look at those figures when they come out next month because I am willing to bet that those figures will in fact have worsened over the last six months. They will not have improved and we are going to see a very much greater level of youth unemployment compared with our OECD trading partners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The costs of youth unemployment cannot be quantified. Apart from the loss of skills and talent, the impact on self-esteem and dignity is devastating not only for young people but also for everyone else out of work. I am sure that every senator in this place knows of someone who is out of work at the moment, someone who is really suffering. I know that, in my own family, there are people very close to me who have been out of work for some time. I have a real appreciation and understanding of the depression that that causes, of the difficulty that that places families in and of the kinds of stresses that that places on relationships. This is happening right around Australia and it is critical that the Government and the Opposition recognise this and, likewise, recognise that there are no easy solutions to the problem. The Democrats recognise that as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Smith Family released statistics only a couple of weeks ago. They are the results of a survey which indicated that an overwhelming 90 per cent of unemployed people are sacrificing some meals and not buying clothes so that they can survive in the recession. That is an astonishing statistic. More than 50 per cent of people are selling their personal belongings to survive. So we are creating, in effect, almost a permanent underclass of people who are simply having to give up everything in order to live, in order to feed their families and in order to survive in these tough economic times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already mentioned the denial of training and education opportunities for young people. We have seen this year the incredible statistics of 100,000 students missing out on places at TAFE and 50,000 students missing out on places at universities. While this is of course a product of the recession and a product of the very high retention rates that have occurred over the last few years&mdash;I acknowledge the Government's contribution in that respect and also that of State governments which have made every effort to keep young people at school longer&mdash;it is the height of hypocrisy for the Government to stand up here and baldly say that it is okay for those students to not gain places. It is not good enough for the Government to simply say that the university sector has reached its optimum level and therefore should not be allowed to grow any further. The fact is that there are young people who want those places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government needs to recognise that funding for higher education has actually declined as a percentage of gross domestic product over the last three years. In fact, only recently, the AVCC has come out demanding that the Government restore funding for higher education to 1983 levels as a percentage of gross domestic product. I think that is a critical move that the Government must make. It must not simply throw the odd handout at education every time it wants to bring down an economic statement of some kind and expect that that will deal with the problem, placate parents whose children cannot find a job and placate the higher education sector which is plagued with under-resourcing, overcrowding and cuts to staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The higher education sector is in absolutely desperate straits at the moment. Just go to the University of Sydney and see how packed those lectures are. Kids cannot even get in to them or they have to sit on the stairs and stand around the walls and take notes. That is overcrowding. Kids are going to tutorials and finding that there are 30 people in the same tutorial; that they cannot actually get the kind of personal teaching they were once entitled to. There is a really very desperate situation in our higher education institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Libraries are having to cut their buying because their budgets are being slashed. That, of course, will have a long term impact on postgraduate research, on the quality of our undergraduate degrees and on the quality of resources offered by universities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The TAFE sector is very high on the Government agenda. I congratulate the Government for finally, after so long, seeing the need to inject a measure of national planning into what has previously been a very uncoordinated area of education policy. The Government is to be congratulated for that. But I plead with the Government, instead of simply bullying the States around the head into accepting its offer to assume responsibility for TAFE funding, to do it in a cooperative way. It should be done with the cooperation and consultation of the States, not by simply kicking them around the head and making stupid announcements such as that made recently by the Prime Minister on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program that he would set up a separate system of vocational training. That is just lunacy. It is ridiculous. There is no way that that could possibly be considered as fiscally responsible in this current climate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government must cooperate with the States. It must address the real issues of a national curriculum; it must address the issue of credit transfer; and it must address the issue of resourcing. We recognise that the Government has set aside $720m in the One Nation statement for the growth in the TAFE sector and, of course, it is to be congratulated for that. But it is time that the planning in this area was cooperative and not done with bully-boy tactics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister has made lofty statements about a youth job summit, and again we welcome that. It is high time that those groups of people in the Australian community who are affected and those involved in planning and delivering social welfare services were actually consulted as to what kinds of measures should be taken to deal with this problem. However, it is our concern that this summit will simply become a giant talkfest for government, for bureaucrats and for peak lobby groups, and that the real voice of youth will simply be eliminated by the whole bureaucracy of the great affair. If the Government wants to find out what is really happening amongst young people and what issues are of concern to young people, it needs to make sure that it brings young people to that table&mdash;and not just articulate opinion leaders amongst youth. The Government needs to find out what is happening in the western suburbs of Sydney, where some suburbs have unemployment rates among young people of 44 per cent. The Government needs to find and talk to those young people who are in desperate straits, not the opinion leaders and the articulate young people who are far removed from the problems of those who are without a job. </PARA>

Most Australians would be very sceptical of that claim and are yet to be convinced of the merits of Fightback. I would like the Opposition to explain to the Australian people and to the thousands and thousands of people currently unemployed, especially the growing numbers who have been out of work for more than 12 months, how it will implement its policy of cutting the dole after nine months. This seems to be an absolutely ridiculous policy. It has been said as baldly as that&mdash;that the dole will be cut after nine months.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have to start by saying that I thought Senator Sowada was above purveying the untruths of the other side in saying that our policy is that unemployment benefits would stop after nine months. I ask her to read our policy before she gets up again to give the same old story as Senator Button and Senator Cook.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today in Question Time Senator Button said that the people on this side of the chamber thrived on bad news. I found that offensive and unacceptable. I do not thrive on bad news. In fact, I do not thrive and am not joyed that the youth jobless rate in my State has more than tripled in the last two years. It has tripled in two years in Senator Evans's State and mine. I do not know about his kids, but a lot of kids in Victoria do not have jobs. He can smile and smirk, but three times the number of young people cannot get jobs now compared with two years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The anti-job cocktail of Keating and Kirner has taken the Victorian rate from the lowest in the country two years ago to the highest. That is why I am on my feet today. It has gone from the lowest in Australia to the highest. In April this year Mr Baldwin went around the country peddling the claim that youth unemployment was 8.8 per cent. He gave Senator Cook a lesson in sleight of hand and obviously he has given Mr Keating a lesson in sleight of hand, because they have been going around with the same line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I issued a press release in April which said that one in two young Victorians were unemployed. When I qualified that headline twice in my press release by saying that one in two young Victorians were looking for work, Senator Cook had the hide to come into this chamber and chide me. Senator West got up&mdash;the stooge with a dorothy dixer&mdash;and asked whether it was true that there was a report that somebody had been claiming that nearly half of young people in Victoria were unemployed. Senator Cook got up and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Senator Kay Patterson. . . put out a press statement which said that one in two young Victorians is unemployed. This has to be rightfully seen as an outrageous and deceptive statement by Senator Patterson.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what Senator Cook said. He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact is that fewer than one in 10 Australian teenagers are unemployed and seeking full time work.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the same old figure that Mr Baldwin brought out. Then yesterday he said it again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wish to set the record straight. The number of unemployed teenagers seeking full time work represents 9.9 per cent of the teenage population, not 34 per cent as claimed by the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA>Those opposite cannot have it both ways. The Labor Party, and Senator Button, Senator Cook and Senator Ray in particular, love to go back to the old days of 1985 and 1983. They regurgitate the figures. I take them back to 16 October 1985 when Senator Cook said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The real priority of this Government is youth and youth programs. . . It is a program that gives real hope and a real future to the young people of Australia. It is assigned the highest priority by the Government. . . It is a program aimed at giving careers, futures and hope to the young people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Hope? What hope, when the number of young unemployed Victorians has tripled in the past two years? What does Senator Cook say? He says that to August 1985 youth unemployment fell from 25.1 per cent to 21.6 per cent, while overall employment fell from 8.9 per cent to 8.3 per cent. This indicates that, even when unemployment falls to 5 per cent, youth unemployment is still likely to be well over 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1985, because it suited his argument, Senator Cook said that youth unemployment was 26.1 per cent while overall unemployment was 8.3 per cent; that is, youth unemployment was three times higher. Now, because it suits his argument, Senator Cook says that youth unemployment&mdash;which we are saying is 34.1 per cent; in his fiddled figures it is 9.4 per cent&mdash;is less than the overall unemployment rate of 10.6 per cent. I do not care whether he is a mathematician or not; Senator Cook cannot have 26.1 per cent to 8.3 per cent being three times greater than 34.1 per cent to 10.6 per cent. It just does not add up. Senator Cook is quite happy to use that 1985 figure, but he will not use it now because he wants to hide the figure for the unemployment rate of young Australians. He wants to hide the unemployment figure. It does not add up. It makes a farce of a statement he made on April Fool's Day this year&mdash;a very appropriate day for Senator Cook to get up and say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What cannot be said of us is that we have ever tried to hide the fact. We have always been honest about the level of unemployment in this country and what needs to be done about it.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the State with the worst level of youth unemployment&mdash;Victoria&mdash;we find that in May 1992 youth unemployment was 46.1 per cent, three times the February 1990 figure of 14.3 per cent. In May 1992, 37,300 young people were looking for full time work, double the February 1990 number of 18,600. That is only part of the story. Senator Baume raised some of these issues. We have to look at the number of unemployed youth including those who because of the economic conditions are working less than 35 hours a week and people in part time work who want to work more hours. In April 1992 that figure for Australia was 90,600 and for Victoria it was 22,900. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have to look at youth who are marginally attached to the labour force; that is, those people who are actively looking for work but who do not meet the criteria to be included in the labour force&mdash;people who want to work, who are not actively looking for work but who would be available for work within four weeks if offered a job. In September 1991&mdash;these are the latest figures&mdash;168,400 young people, 153 per cent of the full time youth unemployment figure, were marginally attached. That is almost the same number as that for unemployed youth, of 176,600. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said that in Victoria the number of youth looking for full time work equalled 37,300. The total number of unemployed youth in Victoria is 45,800. I do not have the figures for marginally attached youth in Victoria, but if we apply the 153 per cent increase for Australia to those who are marginally attached in Victoria, which is an estimated 91,000 or 2 1/2 times the full time youth unemployment rate and two times the total unemployment rate, if we really want the full picture, we have to add on the 22,900 underemployed. That gives a total of 114,000 young people in Victoria who want to work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we use the same process for Australia&mdash;taking into account those two additional groups&mdash;there are 420,000 to 425,000 young people who want to work. The percentage of 15- to 19-year-olds in the total population is 1.4 million. So the 420,000 people who want to work constitute 30 per cent of the total youth population. That is one in three young Australians. The real unemployment rate is the same as the official figure of 34 per cent. Senator Cook, Mr Baldwin and Mr Keating can fiddle the figures all they like, but one in three young Australians cannot get a job; those who want to work cannot get work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the cost of youth unemployment? Mr Burdekin tells us that the cost is increased youth homelessness. Mr Glare, the chief police officer in Victoria, told us yesterday that the cost is rising crime. What else did we hear in the press a couple of days ago? We heard that the cost is increased youth suicide, especially amongst young males and, in particular, young males in the country. On a Pru Goward program some months ago we were told that 90 per cent of young males who suicided in the country in a particular period were unemployed. The person who carried out the study thought that that was one of the major factors. What else do we have? We have poor health, psychological problems of depression and drug and alcohol abuse. It is a legacy of disasters for young people. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the first issue&mdash;what is the true position?&mdash;we have, clearly for political self-interest purposes, obfuscation, competing statistics, manipulation of statistics and the presentation of statistical data in order to make the problem appear much worse than it really is. While I understand that that is the role of an opposition and it is a common thing for oppositions to do, nonetheless, if one is to have a logical program to deal with the problem, we have to be clear about what the problem is and how it is best described. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the debate on this matter of public importance those opposite have said that the Government refuses to acknowledge the true level of youth unemployment. What we have refused to do, and what we will continue to refuse to do, is dishonestly misrepresent the level of youth unemployment in order to support the political argument that the Opposition wants to make. We will cleave to dispassionate, logical analysis to clarify what the case is.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In simple terms, the case is this: as a component of the labour force, seven out of 10 young people between the ages of 15 and 19 years are being trained or are in educational institutions in one way or another; three are in the labour force; and two are working. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So when the Opposition and some misguided journalists allege that the level of youth unemployment in Australia is 34 per cent, and that one in three young people in this country are unemployed, that is a play on statistics which misrepresents the situation.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The true figure is that, of the total youth population, one in three are not unemployed; 9.9 per cent are unemployed.

The Opposition is talking about a reduced commitment to technical education and training; making access to university education the preserve of the wealthy; reducing the opportunities of equal access if one cannot afford the fees; and deregulating the labour market so that young people would become victims of the labour market and not be afforded the interests of equity, true compassion and concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia we have a comparison between our vision and the Opposition's. Our vision is for an Australia which is highly skilled, highly trained and able to absorb international technology at a great rate to let us enjoy a competitive edge in world level skills. We want to turn our economy into a globally competitive economy based on high skills and, yes, high pay as well. That is why since 1983 we have committed ourselves to increase funding to universities in this country by increasing spending in real terms by 42 per cent. That is why since 1983 we have created in this country the equivalent of 17 new universities. That is why in the One Nation statement&mdash;a statement about regenerating and bringing the Australian economy back into economic growth&mdash;we have made a commitment to pouring an extra $720m into technical and further education in Australia to make training opportunities in technical, trade and work related skills more accessible for young Australians.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is not bulldust; that is an accurate comparison&mdash;an uncomfortable one for Senator Campbell, but an accurate comparison. When we talk about the true position, the true position is not the one produced here by Senator Baume and others in a highly coloured political way. The true position is, nonetheless, worrying and concerning. The true position is that we have committed ourselves to a highly skilled, highly educated economy. We have put our money where our mouth is, and the opportunities are greater now for education and training than ever before in the history of this country and, given our continuance in office, will continue to be greater. The truth is that the Opposition's Fightback package&mdash;the tax everybody and benefit the rich package&mdash;reduces training opportunities and limits access to higher education to those who are wealthy. That is the true situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What can be done about it? Youth unemployment is serious&mdash;and we walk away not one whit from that problem&mdash;but it is by no means the most serious area of unemployment. Other categories of workers, particularly aged workers, are in a much more serious situation than that of youth, but for the purposes of this debate we are focusing on young people. What can be done about it is the key issue. What can be done is to develop the Australian economy; take it out of recession and into growth. Through economic growth, we can produce new and better careers, not just jobs. It is not just an issue of jobs. In a highly technological world, new and better careers are careers based on skills and training which can be adapted to meet new technology, as I have said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The One Nation statement was about regenerating growth in the Australian economy. When we look across the range of economic indicators at the moment, what do we find? We find what we forecast&mdash;that there will be no sudden rebound of the economy; there will be slower growth. It will come at a more general level, but it will be solid. It will not go up in a straight line; it will go up in a flatter line, but it will be solid and real. It will be real because of the restructuring of the Australian economy we have undertaken, to turn it from an economy crouching defensively behind a high tariff barrier into an economy which is globally competitive. It will be a solid recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where are we in terms of that recovery? We are in the early stages of it. The signs in housing approvals, the first sign of economic revival, are strong. The signs in new motor vehicle registrations, an early indication of consumer confidence, are up. The number of vacancies advertised in the `Situations Vacant' pages are a sign of increasing job offerings, and all of the indexes that deal with job opportunities are lifting, which indicates that more jobs are becoming available. According to the accurate indications, we are in the early stages of an economic resurgence&mdash;an economic resurgence based on restructuring, which will mean that productivity will grow dramatically in the forthcoming months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in the situation of early recovery, in which one of the key issues to fuel and strengthen that recovery is confidence of the business community, that those opposite, as the professional knockers in Australia, wish to damage the nature of the recovery by taking the political argument down to its meanest, narrowest and lowest denominator. As knockers, good news for the economy is bad news for their electoral prospects; they will never allow their electoral prospects to be damaged by economic growth, so why not have a go at knocking yet again and try to damage the essential ingredient of confidence?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It comes to a question of who is best equipped to deal with this matter. We have a range of programs which are geared to meeting the needs of unemployment and retraining people while they are unemployed. We think that in the circumstances this matter requires re-examination. That is why the Prime Minister has called for the youth meeting to be held next month&mdash;to re-examine whether we are right about all of the settings or whether we need to revisit some of them and tweak them up or improve them in various ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will be an important meeting. It may well be that arising from it there is a fresher approach or we find that the settings are right but need a further commitment of funds or that the economic recovery is taking hold in a stronger way by then and that the settings are right and need to be left alone. But that is an important meeting and, in the interests of this MPI to the question of what is being done about it, that is one of the immediate things that is being done about it. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This argument is about the tactic that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and Senator Cook have undertaken this week; that is, to all of a sudden say that youth unemployment is only one in 10 or 9.9 per cent and not as devastating as each and every one of us in this place and the people in the gallery here today know it is. We have seen from anecdotal evidence, from crime figures, from drug figures and from the devastation amongst young Australians that there is a real problem out there, and to say that youth unemployment is now 9.9 per cent is bulldust and just that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that is the case, then for the first time in Australia's history, and probably for the first time in the history of the free world, youth unemployment is indeed less than that of adult unemployment, and all of us know that is not true. We can talk about how many people are in training and in employment. It is probably a very good thing that there are more people being educated in Australia, but we need to see how they are being educated. Are they being trained for jobs that are there? Are they being trained for jobs that will improve their lot and the lot of the nation when they get out of it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to a report by the Graduate Careers Council of Australia released on Monday, 9 December 1991. It talks about the outlook for graduates and looks at the outlook for people with trade and apprenticeship skills in Australia. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proportion of graduates seeking full-time employment would undoubtedly have been higher but for this rise in further study numbers. It would seem that some graduates decided to `shelter' from the difficult labour market, whilst strengthening their qualifications at the same time.</PARA>
<PARA>That may not be a bad thing to do. But let us not kid ourselves, as this Government wants to do, about the real level of youth unemployment; let us face the fact that whether the unemployment rate is 40 per cent, 30 per cent, 20 per cent or 50 per cent we have a really big problem. The problem will not be solved by having another summit, another talkfest&mdash;which the former Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, made very popular a few years ago. Let us just face the problem. </PARA>

They need action. The problem will not be solved overnight; it will take years and years to fix. We will not fix the problem by kidding ourselves about the real rate of unemployment. That is what the Prime Minister and Senator Cook have tried to do this week.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I add my thanks to Senator Campbell for his courtesy and I will extend the same courtesy to Senator Harradine. In a time of recession not only in Australia but worldwide, in a time of rapid and drastic changes to the structure of the work force, plus an educational culture which has resulted in generations of neglect of post-secondary education in Australia, it is inevitable that it all adds up to a high percentage of young people in neither employment nor education or training. The percentage does matter despite what Senator Sowada believes. I am rather disappointed that she has apparently joined the statistics illiterates opposite. The demoralisation factor in being told that 30-plus per cent of one's age group is unemployed is obviously three times as great as being convinced, as these young people should be because it is accurate, that only one in 10 of that particular cohort is not in the work force and wants to be, and also is not involved in education or training.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question should be: why are these young people not being given the advantage of education, training or work experience? The culture is changing, I suggest. Under this Government, school retention rates have dramatically increased. In 1984, only 48 per cent of young women were in the education system and now 70 per cent are; 42 per cent of young males were in the education system in 1984 and now 58 per cent are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know the argument which says that because there are no jobs these young people stay at school as the only viable alternative and that they would much rather be working. There are some interesting statistics that might back up the notion that young people are making sensible choices about their futures. Of those who completed 12 years of education in the late 1980s, only 3.9 per cent were unemployed; of those who did not complete 12 years of education, 13.8 per cent were unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Young people are perfectly well aware of the fact that by staying on to complete at least 12 years of education they have a much better opportunity of being employed and of enhancing the economic position of the country generally with a much better educated work force. I believe that this is the way we are headed; this is the way we should go. The opportunities for young people are increasing all the time within the education and training systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this stage, 95,000 young women and 70,000 young men are studying basic employment skills in the TAFE system. Achievements over this period to help women and persuade them to stay in the system have been quite dramatic. Memories of the depression and so forth I do not think are particularly useful. The way in which statistics were collected in those days differed significantly from the way in which they are collected now. One should also beware of international comparisons. Those which come from the OECD are invariably qualified one way or another. Switzerland is a classic example. Only citizens are allowed to work in Switzerland&mdash;and one gets the distinct impression that many of its other residents are simply not counted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the reference to the summit is extremely relevant to this debate. I would like to assure people who are concerned about it that the real voice of youth in Australia certainly will be heard at the summit, not just those voices of the opinion leaders, whose opinions are extremely important if they are genuinely reflective of the way in which young people think&mdash;and I have no reason to believe that that would not be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But every effort will be made to ensure that out of this summit comes a plan which will take us perhaps more rapidly towards the point where we have not only a growing economy and a low inflation rate which will make growth much more timely, but also a work force which is trained and has the capacity for retraining, too, for a very different industrial and employment environment from the one which was faced by their mothers, grandmothers or even their older sisters.

However, possible problems must be anticipated. Unemployed youth should not be exploited and used by employers simply to replace full time employees who would be on award wages.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to put a matter on the record in the adjournment debate because of a near tragedy that occurred yesterday in Tasmania. I attempted today to ask a question of Senator Collins in his capacity as the Minister for Transport and Communications but unfortunately, because of the long answers from Ministers and whatever, I could not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday at about 6.40 a.m. a steel fishing boat called the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gail-Jenette II</EMPHASIS> had the misfortune of coming into contact with a floating stump. Unfortunately, it was sunk. It was 15 miles off the Friendly Beaches on the east coast of Tasmania. Because of our new system of emergency communications, it was just pure luck that a fishing boat managed to pick up its distress calls and a tragedy was averted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer the Senate to comments I made in this place in 1990 when it was made known that the Australian Maritime Safety Authority was going to take over and change the system of radio communications around Australia and, in particular, disband Hobart Radio, which provided a very efficient service for fishermen and pleasure craft owners around Tasmania. You would know, Mr Acting Deputy President, that Tasmania has what are regarded as some of the most treacherous oceans in the world. Waves measured on the west coast of Tasmania have been as high as any ever recorded; and, as we all know, Bass Strait is regarded as one of the most dangerous stretches of ocean in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One could understand that, when the Government decided to close down Hobart Radio in 1990, it was greeted with a lot of scepticism by fishing boat and recreational boat owners. As I said, I raised this matter earlier, but, in typical bureaucratic fashion, both the Government and the Department of Transport and Communications assured all those who cried foul at this move that there was nothing to worry about and that the lives of those in ships around the Tasmanian coast would not be put at risk by this cost saving measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will read from a media release that was put out by AMSA on 1 February this year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The introduction of a new sophisticated marine radio system provided Australia with one of the best distress communication networks in the world, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said today.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Collins was here on many occasions when I raised this question in 1990, and the Hobart <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS> ran an editorial raising the concerns of Tasmanian fishermen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The upshot of it is that yesterday at 6.40 a.m. when this near tragedy occurred, the fishermen in question tried unsuccessfully on 2, 4, 6 and 8 megahertz, which are the radio channels that this new system operates under, but could not raise Melbourne. They then turned to the local fishing boat channels, 4620 and 4535, but all to no avail. Then they called the emergency channel, channel 28, on their other radio, but they still had no reply. They tried all these other frequencies, including the emergency 2182 frequency on the first radio, but there was still no reply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the end, it was just by pure chance that Tim Bailey, a fishermen from Bicheno, happened to turn on his radio to call his son who works on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Southern Voyager</EMPHASIS>, a trawler out of Hobart. He thought he would call his son and have a word with him. He turned the radio on and heard, `Mayday, mayday'. He found out that these people were in trouble. He got their co-ordinates and realised that his boat was very close by. They decided that they would send up a flare. He motored over to them. It was not all that far. Within two minutes of his arriving, the boat had gone down. It was just pure luck that he happened to turn his radio on that morning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was told by the fishermen in question&mdash;and I found this out this afternoon by ringing the insurance assessor in Hobart&mdash;that the radio equipment on that modern steel hulled boat was the latest SSB equipment which is required under this new system. It was called a Barrett 250, and made in Western Australia. There should not have been any problem in pumping out a strong enough signal for Melbourne to pick up, or even the other alternative which is Sydney. They tried and tried. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not the first time this has happened. There was another occurrence down at Port Davey when a young fisherman unfortunately took off one of his fingers whilst pulling in craypots. All the boats in the area&mdash;about five of them,  including the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Katrina Marie</EMPHASIS>&mdash;tried to get assistance to get a helicopter into Port Davy to get him out. It was just pure luck that a fishing vessel in Bass Strait managed to pick up the call for assistance and immediately relayed the call to Melbourne. A funny thing happened in that Melbourne contacted the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Katrina Marie</EMPHASIS> straight away. One wonders how Melbourne could contact a boat down there yet the fishermen could not pick up Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not saying that it is negligence on the part of the operators in Melbourne. From speaking to fishermen today, I believe that they are very pleased with the operators in Melbourne. The matter was raised with the Minister when it was decided to abandon Hobart Radio that, because there are areas in Tasmania where the reception is not good, this new system would not be good enough. The Government was warned repeatedly by all those people involved, including the marine police, yet it went ahead and closed down the translators on Bruny Island which did provide, through Melbourne, a much better system. That has gone now and we have these situations which are unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fishermen that I know in Tasmania asked me to put this matter forward today and I thought it was an opportune time to do so, although I know that people want to catch planes to go home. I do not think we should let this matter rest. The loss of this vessel and the circumstances surrounding the rescue once again have raised the question of whether this Government places greater importance on saving a few dollars than on the lives of boat users around the Tasmanian coast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that fishermen are often at sea for weeks at a time, and many of them do not inform their colleagues of where they are going because they are frightened that their colleagues might find out where they are fishing. As I said earlier, if it had not been for that bit of luck&mdash;the chance occurrence of the fisherman Tim Bailey turning on his radio&mdash;it may have been several weeks before the authorities would have even known where these fishermen were. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans), who is at the table, can tap his watch but I intend to put this on the record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the staff in Senator Collins's office are listening. I raised this matter with the Department of Transport and Communications and received a letter which states:</PARA>

Tasmania is unfortunately well known for tragedies at sea. We remember the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Blythe Star</EMPHASIS>; we remember the Japanese fishing boat that was sunk; and we remember plenty of other fishermen.
