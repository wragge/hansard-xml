<PARA>Within a few hours he had put out a press release headed, `Budget forecasts will be met, says Button'. I ask the Minister: what caused him to revise his statement so soon after?

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Hill does not mind, I will answer the question. The Budget forecast is for growth to accelerate through the year to provide average growth of 3 per cent in 1992-93 compared with 1991-92. The important point is that the economy is not yet growing at 3 per cent. I believe it will reach that figure. The only figures we have to rely on at the moment are those from the June quarter where the annualised growth rate was 2 1/2 per cent. There are no available official figures we can rely on at this time; no official figures are available. I believe the forecast will be met and I believed that as at yesterday morning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Hill asked what made me change my mind&mdash;as he put it&mdash;in the period between the Channel 9 interview and later in the day when I put out a press release.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, that is true. I then took steps to put out a press release which reflected my view&mdash;and the view which I have put in the Senate on a number of occasions&mdash;that the Budget forecasts were conservative. Indeed, if Senator Hill examines the Channel 9 interview in detail, he will see that, on the basis of my discussions with business and so on, I put that very view: businesses were reporting increased activity, increased sales and some increase in profits&mdash;and that is consistent with the view.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Alston interjects. The point is, as I have said on a number of occasions: the growth rates are conservative. I personally was expecting higher growth rates earlier in the financial year than we may be achieving; I do not know&mdash;we do not know until we get the official figures. But, in so far as I was disappointed about that&mdash;and looking at it at the present time&mdash;we are not achieving a 3 per cent growth rate at the present time. Later in the year, as the growth rates are announced quarter by quarter, I believe that we will achieve that result, and the through-the-year result will be 3 per cent in accordance with the Budget forecast.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I remind the Minister of that part of my question in which I asked him whether his change of view had anything to do with his discussions in the meantime with Treasurer Dawkins. But, arising out of his answer, I also ask: although he says no official figures are available, has the Government in fact received any advice since the Budget suggesting that perhaps its growth forecast was overoptimistic? Was the Minister taking into account any such advice in his statement on the Channel 9 program?</PARA></TALK.START>

On the first part of the question, I had a discussion with Treasurer Dawkins about this matter yesterday, on two occasions. I have already answered this part of the question because, as I said to Senator Hill in the earlier part, when I left Channel 9 I recognised that I had expressed that badly and I took steps to put out a press release before I had any discussions with Mr Dawkins.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PF4">Senator COLSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question relates to interest rates on credit cards. I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Consumer Affairs whether he is aware of reports in the media suggesting that these rates could fall in the near future. Given the Minister's previous calls in the Senate for banks to reduce their credit card rates, would he outline whether the Government still regards such a fall as desirable?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do notice that some of the banks are belatedly responding to marketplace realities and are in fact signalling that they will reduce interest rates either today or over the next several days. But, really, that is no cause for great applause, and I am quite sure that the Australian people will not be particularly thanking the banks because they are simply passing on to credit card holders the benefit of the fact that the banks have had access to borrowing cheaper money now for many months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, as the Minister for Consumer Affairs over the past several months, before I lost that particular portfolio, I had been working assiduously with the State consumer affairs Ministers to try to bring the banks&mdash;the so-called apostles of the marketplace&mdash;to pass on to consumers the benefits of the cheaper money they have been able to borrow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have always been met, of course, by the claim by the banks that the credit card business is unprofitable, which raises the question of why they stay in that particular marketplace offering that product year after year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A good question.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with Senator Panizza, it is a very good question. It will be very interesting to see what the Prices Surveillance Authority has to say about that matter, particularly as the banks never mention the merchant fees charged to the restaurateurs, the retailers and the hotel and motel operators who all pay a transaction fee whenever one of these deals is transacted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it will be most interesting to see how profitable they have been. Nevertheless, there is an argument that, on the grounds of equity, if the banks were permitted to levy a modest annual administrative fee on credit card holders, it would definitely enable them to reduce interest rates substantially.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Indeed, consumer affairs Ministers have said that, if State legislation is to be altered to enable a modest annual fee to be charged, there must be total, complete, utter offsetting of that annual fee with a commensurate substantial decrease in interest rates&mdash;and of course there would have to be cast iron guarantees that it would not last only for a few weeks but would be extended into the future. These matters are for State legislation, but it will be most interesting to see the Prices Surveillance Authority report in relation to credit card fees, transactions and annual fees possibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I reiterate that in return for a modest annual administrative fee there would have to be most substantial cuts in interest rates absolutely and utterly offsetting that annual fee. If that occurred, I think that then at last Australian consumers of credit&mdash;and we all use these cards; we all live in a credit debt ridden society&mdash;those of us who use these cards, may get the benefit at last of a true reduction in interest rates, very belated but in that case welcome.</PARA>

I remind the Minister of the Treasurer's statement yesterday that Senator Button has `become famous over the years' for statements which are `entirely his own' and not the Government's, and the Treasurer's acknowledgment in the House of Representatives just a few minutes ago that Senator Button has acknowledged that he got it wrong yesterday.

I ask: is the Minister aware of proposals being promoted by the Victorian Government to abolish parliamentary by-elections as a cost-saving measure?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Ray makes a pertinent point. The only unity ticket in support of the proposal seems to encompass the Kennett Government and the former Democrat leader, Don Chipp, who would support it if factions were not involved in selecting the person to take over those seats. This is an absurd approach by former Senator Don Chipp.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We reject the proposal because it is undemocratic. It represents an absurdist approach to economic rationalism. We are told it is put up because it will save money. We say quite simply that one cannot put a price on democracy. It is undemocratic because it has come up at a time some seven or eight days after an election during which this particular issue was not put up by the then Opposition. It would be an abuse of power to proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also undemocratic if one were to look at the concept of parliamentary democracy. At the core of that concept is the notion of elected representation. One wonders what the High Court would do with this proposal because quite basic to its most recent decision was the protection of the application of political participation. An approach which jointly covers section 106 of the Constitution and that most recent decision raises some very serious questions about the constitutionality of any such proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also reject it because it is undemocratic in that it embraces a concept of representation which is one that we reject totally. Mr Storey, who has floated this proposal on behalf of the Kennett Government, says that we should ask the people whether they really want the right to vote in a by-election which has no meaning. That is based on a concept that we reject. It is important to people to know who represents them, to have a choice in that selection and a choice in who acts for them during terms of government. We do not see members of parliament as voting fodder, as do Mr Storey and Mr Kennett.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other problem we have with it is that it is unworkable. If it is based on the concept, presumably, that a majority of three is needed to cover the number of vacancies, who is to know how many vacancies will occur during the course of government? Mr President, the Senate is not a good example. According to the Constitution under which the Senate voting system is provided, direct representation is provided for the lower House, the House in which parliaments are elected and selected. That is precisely why there needs to be a direct approach to filling vacancies in the lower Houses. We reject the proposal because, firstly, it is undemocratic; secondly, it is probably unworkable; and, thirdly, it is possibly unconstitutional.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Justice. I note the very enlightened comments expressed recently by the Minister at a conference on juvenile justice and sentencing options. What practical measures are Federal and State Ministers considering to deal more effectively with young offenders?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1532" SPEAKER="Tate Sen The Hon M.C." NAMEID="NJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="TAS" MINISTERIAL="JUSTICE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some weeks ago in Adelaide a conference was held under the auspices of the Institute of Criminology at which a gathering of national and international experts addressed the question of juvenile justice, which is of concern to us all. I think all honourable senators would agree that every step ought to be taken to deal with those who engage in anti-social behaviour, particularly if it is violent behaviour, in a way which is satisfactory to the community, but not in a way which necessarily means the incarceration of young offenders. Everyone knows that to send a young offender to prison is likely to simply reinforce the criminal milieu in which that young person is operating, and in fact it can be a seminary for crime rather than a case of rehabilitation being offered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that conference a most interesting paper was delivered by a New Zealand judge who spoke of an alternative to imprisonment&mdash;a diversion into the community as it were. This alternative, operating particularly amongst the Maori population of New Zealand, entailed the operation for juvenile offenders of a shame culture whereby a young offender was brought face to face with family, with community and with those against whom he or she had offended. Therefore, the offender had to go through a situation of remorse and admission of wrongdoing, but in a way which then allowed the person to be reincorporated into that community. That seemed to many of us there to have much to commend it. In fact, in Wagga in New South Wales, I believe the New South Wales Police have adopted, with some modifications, a similar principle to divert young offenders from the system of imprisonment and incarceration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is also very important that young offenders be put in a position where later in adult life they can move into employment, education and other opportunities without the stigma of a criminal conviction attached to their name. For that reason, this Parliament has passed a law which, I think in relation to juvenile offenders who have committed a Federal offence, expunges that conviction so that it is no longer in need of disclosure when one applies for employment, education or some other opportunity in adult life. We know that in most cases juvenile offending is a transitory phenomenon and is not carried through to later life and therefore the stigma of conviction should not be an impairment or impediment to, and should not frustrate, reintegration into the adult community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe there are many good steps which can be taken throughout the Australian community to deal with juvenile offenders and I believe that most honourable senators would applaud any step which diverts young offenders from the prison system, except in those rare cases where real violence is offered against the persons of those who are entitled to go about their social or business life without fear of assault.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. The Minister mentioned violence.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe there is a recognition throughout the community that imprisonment ought to be a sentence of last resort. In fact, in the Federal sentencing legislation passed by this Parliament, that particular injunction is made to the judges when they are sentencing Federal offenders. The prosecutor has to draw to the judge's attention that imprisonment is indeed a sentence of last resort. But, quite clearly, there will be instances in which imprisonment is appropriate, having weighed up the options of community service orders, a fine or some other penalty. Quite obviously, those penalties will be inadequate as an expression of the community's outrage and the need to contain somebody who has engaged in really violent activity. So in those situations it is justified. I believe that that general principle now has widespread support in the Australian community. It is one that certainly this Parliament has endorsed and that I support.</PARA></TALK.START>

As a lagged indicator in terms of recovery from the recession, employment is predicted to improve towards the end of the financial year as business activity improves.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Recently, the US Bureau of Labour Statistics published a table which showed OECD countries ranked according to labour costs, including on-costs. In that table, Australia ranked well below the OECD average of countries. The findings of the United States Bureau of Labour Statistics show that, in 1991, hourly labour costs for production workers in manufacturing in Australia were 20 per cent below the OECD average. Australia ranked sixteenth out of the 20 OECD countries; that is, 15 OECD countries had labour costs which were higher than Australia's. The only countries which were lower were Spain, Ireland, New Zealand and Portugal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the issue of on-costs&mdash;that is, those other costs associated with employing labour, such as superannuation and workers compensation&mdash;Australia was well down the list of OECD countries. According to the United States table, on-costs in Australia, as a proportion of all labour costs, accounted for 25.3 per cent of total labour costs. In this table, Australia ranked fifteenth out of the 18 OECD countries, which was lower than Japan, whose on-costs were calculated at 41.8 per cent; the US, whose on-costs were calculated at 27.7 per cent; and the United Kingdom, whose on-costs were quoted at 26.9 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those figures show that we have been successful in reforming industrial relations and making the Australian workplace more productive. They also show the lie that the Opposition sometimes peddles in this country&mdash;that labour costs in Australia are prohibitive. Compared to a series of like economies, labour costs in Australia are extremely competitive. Rather than run around this country condemning Australian workers, this is an occasion to congratulate Australian workers for doing a good job and achieving those figures, and urging Australian workers and their employers to work harder to put us at the bottom of this table to ensure that we have the world's most competitive costs on productivity. I think that that can be done as long as we maintain the level of industrial harmony that we have achieved in this country and work within the positive framework of generating a team approach to making our economy more productive.</PARA>

Our definition of workplace or enterprise bargaining is to regard the award system, as determined by the Commission, as a system of minimum rates awards providing the safety net from which workplace or enterprise bargaining can be constructed. If, however, one is in Victoria&mdash;the attitude of the Government there being, as I am informed by Mr Howard, similar to or almost the same as that of the Federal Opposition&mdash;and enterprise bargaining seeks to tip everyone out of the award system, make their futures less certain and, with no protections, encourage that type of bargaining, then we will get a psychology in the work force that people will go for broke.</PARA></TALK.START>

What we did decide was to bring forward the biennial meetings between the various members of the defence hierarchy to once a year in order to discuss the strategic issues of the region. Further to that, the only other decision we really made in that respect was to exchange views on peace-keeping forces. The Japanese have just committed themselves to the UN peace-keeping forces and seek our advice on our historical experience in this regard. Similarly, Australia is very interested in the views of Japan as a country that has committed itself for the first time and is coming as a new player into the field, if you like. So putting up the straw man that we are having joint exercises with Japan could have been avoided if Mr Downer had taken the time to read the transcript of my press conference in Japan.

However, where particular employers and particular workers want to vary their awards or where the Commission finds as a matter of fairness, justice and equity in the case of a particular industry that, upon argument, there is a case to vary an award to provide more, the Commission as the umpire should be entitled to do so, or those workers and employers should be entitled to agree to do so and put it in their award so that it is legally binding and forms the basis for an entitlement.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The State Law and Order Restoration Council, or SLORC, in Burma has announced the formation of an 18-member convening commission to organise the national convention on or before 10 January 1993. That commission will select participants for the national convention incorporating representatives of the remaining registered political parties, ethnic and other groups. The stated purpose of the national convention is to lay down guiding principles for the drafting of a new constitution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The SLORC has enunciated a framework of objectives for the national convention. They include non-disintegration of the union; non-disintegration of national solidarity; consolidation and perpetuation of sovereignty; emergence of genuine multiparty democracy; development of principles of justice, liberty and equality; and also, rather less appealingly, participation of the armed forces in what is described as `the leading role' in future national politics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, on the more positive side, I should note that it was recently announced that two martial law orders imposed in 1988 have been revoked&mdash;the most significant effect of this decision being to end the use of military tribunals, which have been responsible for most of the summary justice dispensed in Burma in recent times, including most of the sentences meted out to political prisoners. Again, 85 prisoners were released between 22 September and 1 October. According to SLORC announcements, that brings the total number of prisoners released this year to 572, including 38 elected representatives. Again, on 28 September, the SLORC did announce a re-organisation of local law and order councils under which army officers would be replaced by local administrative councils.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The announcement of a date for the national convention and the recent releases of political prisoners and other matters to which I have referred may constitute modest progress towards the long overdue process of democratic reform in Burma. But I have to say that it is still clear that Burma's rulers are not contemplating the early installation of a democratic government, with the result that, unhappily, it is only too likely that Burma's economy and human rights records will continue to languish among the world's worst.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No timetable has been set for a return to multiparty democracy. The objectives which, as I indicated a moment ago, were set out to guide the recently formed commission are ambiguous, referring on the one hand to multiparty democracy but on the other hand to the leading role of the armed forces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the revocation of two martial law orders, the apparatus of military rule by decree certainly remains in place and again, despite the release of political prisoners, more than 1,000 remain in detention or prison, including nearly 40 elected representatives and, of course, Burma's most popular political leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, Australia will be maintaining pressure on SLORC to effect early meaningful political change through such means as we sensibly can. In the Senate a few days ago, on 15 September, I outlined a number of additional steps which I have decided will be taken to that end. Again, it is worth saying that just a few days ago in New York at the United Nations I made some very strong representations to Burma's Foreign Minister and set out Australia's&mdash;and indeed international&mdash;concerns on all these matters.</PARA>

In view of the fact that the Government provides Medicare benefits for mothers seeking abortions, will the Government provide more funds to the IVF programs to enable more families to take part?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amount of benefit paid for a treatment cycle depends on the nature of the treatment.

Medicare benefits are currently available for six treatment cycles involving hyperstimulation of the ovaries in the patient's lifetime.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to very briefly put on the record that at the time of the last election the Labor Government made a very extensive list of promises in relation to the environment which it has simply not kept.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time of the last election the Australian Conservation Foundation, together with other conservation groups, asked all the political parties a number of questions&mdash;some 93.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party also went ahead and gave a qualified yes to a further 17 questions, or 16 per cent of the survey.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence of a very extensive analysis which we have carried out of the actual performance of the Labor Government in the past three years, we find that it has fulfilled only 26 of the promises it gave&mdash;that is, 25 per cent of the questions to which it answered yes at that time. Also, it has broken no fewer than 63 promises&mdash;60 per cent of the questions to which it answered yes before the last election. </PARA>

In spite of what Senator Coulter says about the Australian Labor Party's conservation platform, his party tacitly, if not directly, supported the Labor Party at the last election, the same as it does in this chamber practically every day. If the Democrats are so concerned about conservation issues, why did they not oppose the Labor Party at the last election?</PARA>

Let us talk about those policies which they have pursued with great vigour along the same lines as this Labor Government. The small business supporters are very upset with that Democrat program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I point out that this argument can be solved by a couple of very simple figures.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot let a lot of this waffle go by without making at least some comment. First, I go back to some comments that Senator Macdonald made regarding the lack of success of the Democrats. It is certainly not the case, but the usual tendency of the Opposition is to twist things to the way in which it sees may possibly be to its advantage. For example, in the last two by-elections that have been held in South Australia we have come in in second place. It is a bit of selective remembering that leads to the twisting and the biased allegations that we get from Senator Macdonald.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now look at the actual voting system. Anybody listening would begin to believe that the Democrats somehow run around to every polling booth on polling day, get out all the votes and somehow change them to read `Labor Party' instead of `Liberal Party'. For the benefit of anyone who is listening, the way in which Australians cast their vote is purely up to them. Where their No. 2, 3 and 4 preferences go is up to every individual voter. For many elections the Democrats have&mdash;and we will be doing this at the next Federal election&mdash;issued what we call double-sided how-to-vote cards which show very clearly what the person voting may choose to do, remembering that they do not have to follow anybody's how-to-vote card. They can choose to give their second preference to the Liberal Party, in some cases perhaps via an Independent, or they can choose to give their second preference to the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might be of some benefit if Senator Kemp were to check the records in some of the seats. Indeed, at least one seat in South Australia was won for his Party on our preferences. It tends to be a little different from electorate to electorate. If we look at the votes for the electorate of Hawker, we see that that seat was won for the Liberal Party on Democrat preferences as it did not have sufficient votes at the initial primary count. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to my portfolio areas&mdash;and moving away from economic issues and on to social justice issues&mdash;time and again we have seen the Liberal Party combine with the Labor Party to tighten the social security system until we have a system where we see more and more people falling completely through the social security net. We really have an anti-social insecurity system. It has not been done just by the Labor Party; it has been done with the active support, and indeed encouragement, of the Liberal Party. We have only to look into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document to see how far the Liberal Party would really go in this area. Just one example is the continual lowering of incomes for young people. This has been done across the board&mdash;for young people with disabilities and young people on unemployment benefits&mdash;to make it more and more difficult for young people to have even the minimal amount that they need to provide themselves with food and clothing. The whole social justice area is yet another area that this Parliament deals with where the Liberals have consistently supported the Labor Party and enabled its draconian legislation to pass. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the brief time that is available I would like to say that I was a bit surprised by Senator Coulter's initial question on the Government's position on the GST. But his moving to take note of the answer makes it obvious that it was asked in order to get at the issue of the Government's environment policy and its actions on that policy, a true issue of concern. The reason that I was surprised by the question itself was that, if there is any doubt about the position of any party on the GST, it has to be that of the Democrats. On at least three occasions on the public record, evidence of which I happen to have with me in the chamber, doubt has been cast on the Democrats' position on the GST. The most recent of those is where, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> of the first of this month, the economic spokesperson, Senator Kernot, was reported as saying that, if the GST Bills taxed food, the Democrats would delay them by referring them to a committee&mdash;not block the GST as a whole, but delay them in a committee for some time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As early as March this year, Senator Kernot's own <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Treasury and Finance Bulletin</EMPHASIS>, which is a public document, stated that the Democrats would oppose a tax on the necessities of life and even look at extending exemptions from the GST, which is far from opposition to the GST as a whole. On 3 September, Senator Kernot welcomed Premier Carmen Lawrence's threat to go to the High Court concerning charges on State instrumentalities which may occur as a result of the GST, on the basis that it might have some effect on an implemented GST. Of course, we have also had Senator Coulter, the Leader of the Democrats, stating unequivocally the Party's opposition to the GST. I suppose the real question is: who will prevail after the election&mdash;Senator Kernot or Senator Coulter?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commend Senator Powell for some of her wise observations and point out, of course, that Senator Coulter used this technique, which he has foreshortened for us all to use, in order to raise the issue of how the Government had backtracked and double-crossed on its so-called environmental undertakings. This was, of course, following up the press releases Senator Coulter put out and the print coverage Senator Coulter endeavoured to have over the weekend. So we can see the strategy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of matters which need to be put on the record. First, I refer honourable senators to the table which Senator Kemp lodged with the Senate last week showing the number of times that the Democrats have voted with the Government, making a distinction between matters of substance and matters of process and noting that the Democrats have become the fourth faction of the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second thing that needs to be put on the record is that at the last election the current Opposition won more primary votes than the Labor Party, which in fact took government, and the only reason it took government was that the Democrats directed their preferences to the Labor Party. So, in effect, like so many Labor governments that struggled through their last years, on a true interpretation we really do have a minority Labor government here, yet the Democrats continue to support it on matters which they consider are in their own interests. Heaven only knows what the interest is. It could not possibly be a matter of principle. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suspect Senator Bishop will be sorely disappointed, particularly when the electorate hears what the Liberal Party of Australia and its coalition partner are actually doing with the legislation which comes before them. What does the Opposition do with the initiatives which the Australian Democrats put forward in opposition to the Government? The Opposition does not vote with the Democrats; it votes with the Government. All those figures which Senator Kemp is so keen to trot out day after day really do not mean anything.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the substance. On 5 March 1992 the Democrats moved an amendment to the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill requesting that families covered by the assistance for isolated children scheme&mdash;I would have thought that this would have been of some concern to the Opposition&mdash;should also receive the one-off bonus payment being made to family allowance recipients. But no, the Opposition voted with the Government against the Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where does the Opposition stand now? On 1 April, the Democrats moved a motion that further reductions in tariffs should be suspended whilst the unemployment rate remained at such a high level. One would think that the Opposition would have some concern for the one million unemployed, but no, it has no concern whatsoever. The Opposition votes with the Government. It wants to cut tariffs. The Opposition does not care whether industries go into the ground. It does not care whether the one million unemployed becomes two million unemployed. Yet, the Opposition expects the electorate to vote for it. That is absolutely ridiculous. </PARA>

<PARA>This is not only a matter of urgency, it is also a matter of the utmost importance to all Australians. It is a matter of the utmost importance even more to those one million Australians who are now officially unemployed and that further one million who are either hidden unemployed or underemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Keating Government is out of control&mdash;it has no strategy, it has run out of ideas, it is out of touch with reality, it raises false expectations only to have these cruelly dashed when the results come in, it totally lacks leadership, and no Australian can any longer believe anything that its leader says. Yesterday we had Senator Button go on national television and in effect imply these obvious facts. Yesterday on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program in a very illuminating interview Senator Button gave on Channel 9, amongst other things, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is the slow down in the world economy and nobody can say with certainty when that `but' will be removed from the discussion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I mean we gave growth figures in the Budget forecasts. I'm not absolutely confident that we will attain those now but as we move towards them employment will improve.</PARA>
<PARA>That was a quite unequivocal statement by Senator Button that, and I quote again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'm not absolutely confident that we will attain those Budget forecasts.</PARA>
<PARA>Something happened between that statement and a few hours later because a few hours later Senator Button issued a press release which was headed, `Budget forecasts will be met says Button'. And that press release, amongst other things, followed on the theme of the heading and said, `So I believe that the targets will be met'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no way in which the first statement that Senator Button made on television can possibly be reconciled with the statement contained in his subsequent press release. So the question is: why the change? Did he tell the truth the first time or did he actually get it wrong on national television and the right version is in fact what he put out several hours later?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Button is the third most senior Minister in this Government. He is the Leader of the Government in the Senate. For almost a decade now he has been the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce. He is very close, so he says and so it is said, to industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Is it possible to credit that Senator Button actually got it wrong the first time and then had to go and correct it? If so, how could this possibly have happened? Why yet again did he have to humiliate himself publicly by later putting out a statement totally opposite to his original one? Why did he change his statement? Who monstered him this time, I wonder? Who caused him to switch yet again like a chameleon from honest John in the morning on television to political John when he made his retracting statement in the afternoon? As Michelle Grattan put it in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, that was a switch that even for Senator Button came `more quickly than usual'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Button says that the Prime Minister did not cause him to make his retracting statement&mdash;but is that really so? Was it someone on the Prime Minister's staff? We know that Senator Button spoke with the Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, because he has said so and, indeed, today in Question Time he said that he had spoken to him twice. I think that when Senator Button responds in this debate, he owes the Senate and, through the Senate, the Australian people an answer to the following questions: when did he speak to Mr Dawkins; why did he speak to Mr Dawkins; and who actually rang whom?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was intrigued to see the comments of Mr Dawkins reported in today's press. When he was asked what Senator Button had meant, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, I'm not quite sure what he meant. I saw what he said, but I don't know what he meant.</PARA>
<PARA>That sounds a little to me like, `Read my lips'. He went on though to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that was one of the statements for which Senator Button has become famous over the years&mdash;entirely his own.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Dawkins did not point it out, but it needs little recall to realise that over the years Senator Button has indeed made some stunning statements in the media and elsewhere which have put his Government into a situation of acute political embarrassment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;More often, as my colleague Senator Michael Baume says, not because he got up and said the wrong thing but because he got up and said the right thing. He got it right, he was honest. That is one of the things that separate Senator Button from many of his erstwhile colleagues, not the least of whom is the now Prime Minister, Mr Keating. We all remember&mdash;and I still remember feeling myself blanch on Senator Button's behalf when I heard it&mdash;the Prime Minister making that absolutely blistering, cruel public and humiliating attack on Senator Button back in May 1990 when Senator Button was honest enough to talk about micro-economic reform and the fact that it was falling too far behind the pace.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we do not have to go back to that time to remind ourselves of some of the other comments made by Senator Button. Less than two months ago he made various comments in relation to the Australian dollar because of his assessment of the prospects for the economy and the balance of payments outlook which put considerable pressure on the Australian dollar. A couple of months earlier, back in March of this year, he made various statements that accorded in very close degree with what the coalition has been saying about the appropriate approach to tariff policy in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In May 1990, only a couple of years ago&mdash;and to me this is perhaps the most important of all Senator Button's expressions of honesty&mdash;he said that there were hard times still ahead. That was at a time, you may recall, Mr Acting Deputy President, when only two months before both the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, and the then Treasurer, Mr Keating, had said in the run-up to the March 1990 election that there would be no recession. The Treasurer indeed said, `We won't let a recession happen'. Only two months later in May 1990, Senator Button very honestly, frankly and correctly foreshadowed to the Australian people that there would indeed be some very hard times ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I come back to the question: why did Senator Button change his story yesterday; and who forced him to make that change? I look forward to Senator Button's honest response in this debate along the frank lines that he has been noted for and to which I have referred on this and other occasions. What Senator Button said yesterday on television was that he was, in effect, projecting a weaker recovery than that which was foreshadowed in the Budget. How do the Prime Minister's assertions last week of the recession being over long ago sit alongside this statement of Senator Button's&mdash;honest John not political John&mdash;on that occasion?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Senator Button said yesterday should not have caused too much surprise to anyone. His original statement yesterday on television was by no means unreasonable. It is very much in accord with the facts as known of the state of the Australian economy, particularly when we look at the deteriorating situation and the deteriorating prospects for growth internationally. I agree completely with the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> which, in its editorial this morning, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before he corrected himself, Senator Button was simply saying what many have been thinking as they have watched the economic outlook for the US, Japan and Europe deteriorate over the past month. Slower growth by the world economy will make it more difficult for the Australian economy to grow at the 3 per cent forecast in the Budget for this financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That should be no surprise to anyone. If this Government were honest, if it were prepared to take the Australian people into its trust and into its confidence, it would be getting up and saying precisely that. Instead, we have had the situation where the Government has had dragged out of it a continually lesser series of forecasts for growth for this year and for that of the years ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of February&mdash;only six or eight months ago&mdash;the Government's One Nation statement forecast a 4.7 per cent economic growth for 1992-93. We told the Government at that time&mdash;as did virtually every economic commentator and certainly every businessman&mdash;that that forecast of 4.7 per cent growth for 1992-93 was absolute rubbish. There was no way in the world that that forecast would be met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government itself has now accepted that. It came out in the Budget just six months later with a 3 per cent forecast&mdash;and even that, we said at the time, was almost certainly too high. It came out with that higher than reasonable forecast because it has one almighty hole in its Budget figuring for the next few years; it has an enormous gap between its huge spending programs, which are going to expand government expenditure enormously over the next few years, and the forecasts of the revenue it will raise to meet that expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has gone for a huge `spend now, pay later' Budget policy, which has been its position for the last couple of years and which will continue to be its position in the future. The Government claims that it is going to be responsible and bring the Budget back into balance by the middle of the decade. But with growth down below 3 per cent that is impossible and, indeed, even at 3 per cent on the Government's own figuring, there is an irreconcilable hole in the Budget arithmetic at least over the period up to the middle of this decade and a cumulative deficit of about $50,000m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had a deterioration in the Budget in the last two  years alone of $17.5 billion. This year the Government is forecasting&mdash;and it is almost certainly a massive underestimate&mdash;a further deficit in the Budget of $13.4 billion, taking the deficit over the three years to this year to $30 billion on the facts and the Government's own figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have never seen such a massive deterioration in the budgetary situation of this country. It spells two major inevitabilities over the next few years. One is a massive increase in interest rates and the other is a massive increase in taxes. Both of those must follow axiomatically from the decisions that the Government has taken and the policy path on which it is set. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen amendment after amendment after amendment to the forecasts in terms of growth and Budget deficit size. Every forecast that the Government has made over the past several years has had to be massively revised, and even most of the revisions have turned out to be incorrect in the end as well. I hope that Senator Button&mdash;when making his honest, frank and pretty accurate assessment&mdash;will tell us today that the 3 per cent forecast for this year is unlikely to be attained. I hope he will be telling us whether that expectation on his part is on the basis of material that has been provided to him, a reassessment by his Department, or whether there have been any official revisions of the forecasts by the Treasury or any other official government agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly if one looks at the private sector which really provides the income and wealth creation, the profits, and therefore the job prospects in this country, one finds that the private sector is telling the Government that the signs of economic growth are almost non-existent. Last week several of the leading companies made statements saying just that. The company A.V. Jennings said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recovery could be up to 5 years away.</PARA>
<PARA>Pacific Dunlop, one of the most dynamic companies in Australia, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Economic recovery would not occur until 1995.</PARA>
<PARA>BHP made the following statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We expect the economic environment both domestically and internationally to remain subdued in 1992-93.</PARA>
<PARA>North Broken Hill Peko said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The company's 1992-93 profit would continue to be hit by the recession. The largest retailer in Australia, Coles-Myer, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The retail world is collapsing around us.</PARA>
<PARA>That statement is well and truly confirmed and supported by today's retail sales figures which show virtually no growth at all in retail sales in the past month. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past when Senator Button has disagreed with the Prime Minister and the Treasurer of the day, Senator Button is the one who normally has been proved right. I have already quoted to the Senate the `hard times' ahead forecast by Senator Button in 1990. He made it quite clear that we were going into a recession, a recession that at that time Prime Minister Hawke and Treasurer Keating denied would ever happen, because they would not let it happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to look at some of the untruths that this Prime Minister has delivered in recent years, particularly when he was Treasurer. Let us go back to 1990. In eight short months he made the following statements. The first one made was two weeks before the 1990 election:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will not let there be a recession.</PARA>
<PARA>A couple of months later:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are bringing home the bacon.</PARA>
<PARA>He said `These are beautiful figures' when the balance of payments deficit fell from something like $2 billion in one particular month down to $1.5 billion. Big deal! He is still running a balance of payments deficit of $18 billion or more. Then he went on say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is the recession we had to have.</PARA>
<PARA>He said that about nine months after he had said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will not let there be a recession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister has gone on to cover himself with equal glory in terms of his inability to state the factual situation par excellence in recent days. In the past week he said that the recession is now long behind us. Last week he had the hide to say that this Government had saved Australia. Saved Australia is right! The foreign debt is $150 billion, unemployment and underemployment represent almost $2 billion, the balance of payments deficit is still enormous, with collapsed investment around Australia and a huge, gaping and growing Budget hole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a situation where Senator Button has blown the whistle on his Government. We have a government in disarray.

Out of 13 interest rate cuts, six of them were opposed by the Opposition on the basis that they would be over-stimulatory of the Australian economy and that they would lead to excesses.

Maybe that was what he had in mind, but the fact is that inflation in Australia has not been at double digit level since this Government came to office and started to clean up the mess which we inherited from the conservatives opposite. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say a few things about substantiating the Budget forecasts. A sustainable housing recovery is taking place in Australia at present. In fact, the housing recovery looks faster than was forecast at Budget time. That is based on the fact that housing finance, local government approvals and commencements are improving. The Housing Industry Association's survey of volume builders for August shows continuing trend growth for sales and starts. Private housing approvals for the first two months of the September quarter were 13.1 per cent above the equivalent period a year ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I agree that private consumption spending continues to grow at a modest pace, as we expected for this stage of the recovery. Business investment and employment will recover in the wake of an increase in GDP, which we talked about earlier in this debate. Indeed, in the Channel 9 interview, which Senator Short highly selectively quoted from, as did everybody else, I made that point about business anticipation and the sort of reports that businesses were making to me. Employment recovery is, sadly, a slow indicator following any period of recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have already said, concerns about international economic conditions which affect Australian Budget forecasts ignore the fact that those Budget forecasts were not at the time based on an assumption of strong overseas growth. Much play is made of a difference in scenario one, as it was called, in the One Nation statement in February for an increase in growth of 4 1/2 per cent or 4.75 per cent&mdash;I forget which&mdash;and the subsequent growth figure forecast in the Budget that is affected by changes in the international economy.

It is no good looking at John Hewson's Thatcher model in Britain to get a clear picture of what is happening because that is just a disaster area, as is the low growth of, and the failure to expand, the economy in New Zealand, where the Opposition's eyes are also sometimes cast.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Short says, I know that some large businesses have said that economic growth will not be as fast as they anticipated.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The September quarter surveys of manufacturers by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Westpac showed the best investment intentions response for two years. It is fair to say, as the Prime Minister said at the weekend, that the economy is growing and we are moving away from the recession. Some countries are not moving away from recession at all, but we are, although more slowly than anyone in the Government would like.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program, the 13 monetary policy easings and the One Nation and subsequent fiscal measures will continue to help boost the economy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Button for finishing on that note, because it is the very point that I want to pick up&mdash;namely, it is a great pity that this debate today should have been couched in those rather narrow econometric terms which hinge on definitions of growth and economic indicators. It should have dealt with the far more important question, which is how we address the very severe social problems of this country and how we can put Australians before economic indicators and address the problems of fairness, equity and a fair go.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accept the Opposition's criticism of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for saying that the recession is long over. Again, the Prime Minister was doing the same thing; he was simply pointing to that abstract, esoteric indicator that shows that there were so many quarters of growth as measured by economists, which was sufficient for him to say that the recession was over. He totally ignored the plight of the very many people who are unemployed and living in poverty and the very many single families and children who are living well below the poverty line, and so on. The really important issue is how we put Australians before these narrow economic indicators. I will return to that in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did not see Senator Button yesterday on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program, so I am not sure whether he talked about expectations for growth and jobs. What I heard from the Opposition centred on expectations for growth. As I say, I will return to that matter in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the economic growth rates in the One Nation statement were wildly optimistic, and I said so at the time. Senator Short mentioned that many other commentators at that time said that they were quite unrealistic. At that stage, the Australian Democrats called for a $6 billion fiscal expansion program to get employment growing strongly, but the Prime Minister only delivered $2 billion. We were right, and the Government had to adopt a more expansionary Budget. Certainly the Prime Minister should be condemned for the false expectation of jobs that he created at that time and for not following our proposals in getting to work to raise the money necessary for those jobs out of taxation rather than simply increasing the deficit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 4 3/4 per cent growth rate from One Nation was revised down to a more realistic 3 per cent in the Budget. Last year the Australian economy grew by 1.6 per cent but it is not outlandish to forecast a 3 per cent growth rate for this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does this growth rate actually mean? It means an increase in the gross domestic product this year compared with last year. That gross domestic product is a dollar measure of all the goods and services which are made available in the country in that particular year, having taken out the inflation factors. So it means a real increase in the dollar value of goods and services. But we should note that it also includes a lot of bad things. When Senator Walsh was the Minister for Finance some years ago I asked him: where does the $6 billion that we spend on motor vehicle accidents appear in the national accounts? He pointed out, quite correctly, that it appears as an addition to the gross domestic product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that members of both the Labor and Opposition parties seem to very willingly ignore is that both benefits and disbenefits, or costs, are included in GDP. It is possible to have our GDP growing and not necessarily have an increase in either employment or human welfare. As long ago as 1982, Barry Jones published the book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sleepers, Wake!</EMPHASIS> and he pointed out that it would be possible to produce all the goods and services made at that time with some 6 per cent to 10 per cent of the population working if we were to go down the high-tech road and use all the gadgetry then available. One can easily imagine that it would be possible to have a `growing economy' with a very small proportion of the population working. Provided that the benefits in terms of some of the cash which was available was redistributed so people could buy those goods and services, one could have very low levels of employment and nonetheless have a growing economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the late 1970s an American socialist, Morris Morris, worked out an index of human welfare, an objective measure of human welfare based on equal parts of literacy, infant mortality and longevity. He showed that there was no correlation whatsoever between economic growth or per capita GDP and human welfare. When he did this work in the late 1970s Sri Lanka came out very high on the index of human welfare but very low on per capita GDP whereas Saudi Arabia was very high on the index of per capita GDP but extremely low on the index of human welfare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One needs to be extremely careful when both government and opposition simply use GDP or growth of GDP, which is what economists mean when they are talking about growth, as a surrogate for human welfare and link it in with ideas of jobs. We need to move away from that index and move more closely to one which is a real measure of human welfare. It is that measure which we need to move towards improving or increasing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Button's comments yesterday that the economy may not attain a 3 per cent growth target simply reflect the fact that at this stage he was being more candid than other members of the Government. Presumably, he has been advised of this lower than expected economic activity and as such the Government should release that advice and rethink its economic strategy. His subsequent statement that Australia is well placed to achieve the target simply reflects the pressure put on him by his own Party to not tell the truth. In this, we would agree with the Opposition. This shows the basic immorality of the Government's approach. The cartoon in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> highlights the absurdity of this situation. It shows schoolboy Senator Button being caned by principal Keating and being castigated for telling the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real issue concerning the false expectations is the outrageous and callous remarks of Mr Keating last week to which I have already referred. His boast that the recession is over simply shows that he views Australia and the people of Australia as less important than these abstract economic indicators. The fact that the Opposition has raised this debate in those narrow terms indicates that the Opposition itself should be castigated for dealing with what has happened to those narrow economic indicators and not concentrating on the more substantial human issues. </PARA>

<PARA>Returning to Senator Button's assertion, we then have the most unbelievable assertion that the Government has saved this country. This is more than simply a cruel hoax; it is a delusion of grandeur. Exactly what have his economic policies saved us from? They have saved us from publicly owned businesses, they have saved us permanently from low unemployment, they have saved us from owning the businesses operating in Australia and they have saved us from being able to control the supply of credit and the interest rates in the economy.

It is also one in which there can be very significantly lower environmental contamination because the heat from that mill will be used for power generation, either 200 or 300 megawatts of power.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need to condemn the false expectations for growth and jobs promoted by the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, as exposed by Senator Button on national television yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA>Without wishing to be distracted for more than but a moment from the comments I wish to make, I refer for a fleeting second to Senator Coulter's comments. I notice that Senator Coulter agreed with us that Senator Button told the truth on television and changed the truth when he left the television studio about the level of expectation of growth in this period. Our view is that a growth of less than 3 per cent will be a disaster for the Australian economy. I do not know whether the Australian Democrats agree with that, but where we and the Democrats part company is on the Democrats' amendment where they are suggesting that we are using narrow economic and social indicators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can think of no other way of better articulating the social welfare of this country than looking at its level of growth. Senator Button says that we need 3 per cent growth just to stabilise employment or, to put it another way, to stabilise unemployment. If we do not have the growth, we do not have the jobs; if we do not have the jobs, then of course we will not have the social standards, social expectations and quality of life which, I am sure, even the Democrats would wish us to have. Senator Coulter talked about value adding and the steel mill in Western Australia. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XF4">Senator CRICHTON-BROWNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it is in Australian dollars in both cases. I agree with Senator Button, in his blush of honesty on television, when he said that he did not expect us to reach growth of 3 per cent. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We gave growth figures in the Budget forecasts. I'm not absolutely confident that we will attain those now but as we move towards them, unemployment will improve.</PARA>
<PARA>He is saying that he has grave reservations about them; otherwise he would not have raised them. It was not a matter on the margin; it was a matter clearly of concern to him. That is, frankly, a view I have under this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The acute embarrassment in which this Government finds itself as a result of a rare blush of honesty from Senator Button is that the truth has been exposed. As a result of that, Senator Button exposed the projections for what they really are. It is a great pity that Senator Button did not show the same honesty in the euphoria of the One Nation statement, the first statement made by this new Prime Minister, when the Government was projecting 4 per cent or 5 per cent, which was never going to be visited on this economy, although it suited the purpose for that modem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sadly, Senator Button's outburst of honesty lasted no longer than it took him to vanish from the glow of the television lights. We are now told that Senator Button, upon leaving the theatre of the studio, immediately repented and suggested that he had made a mistake. The only mistake that Senator Button made was that he told the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Mr Dawkins says, that was one of the statements for which Senator Button has become famous. What does Mr Dawkins mean? He means that every now and then as a result of an aberration Senator Button stands up and tells us the truth and causes grave embarrassment for the Government. Of course, Senator Button is in some respects a liability to this Government because he insists on these outbursts of truth from time to time. Does anybody seriously believe that Senator Button was in a flight of fancy and did not have good reasons and substantial evidence for saying what he did? Of course not. Has anybody suggested that Senator Button went on television and told a lie and then left the studio, repented and told the truth? Of course not. Senator Button simply forgot the Government's script. To suggest that he lied on television and then owned up afterwards is absurd nonsense. He told the truth on television and repented for his weakness later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that Mr Willis says that Senator Button was speaking for himself and not for the Government and was not expressing publicly the Government view. The truth, of course, is that Senator Button's portfolio requires him to rub shoulders with private industry and to consult with industry. It requires him to have some primitive knowledge of the circumstances of the economy. It is no doubt as a result of that knowledge that he felt, in his blush of embarrassment under the hot lights of the television studio, the need to own up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Button's Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce is also that department which, on a daily basis, deals with business and private enterprise. I believe that they are telling him that the forecasted figures as given by the Prime Minister and the Government are not true and that they have given him their own assessments. As I say, Senator Button, in his rare moment of honesty, is nothing more than an aberration for this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The history of this Government is one of cruel deception and dishonesty, creating false hopes only to have them dashed by broken promises. This comes from a government which pretends to be both open and honest. I quote Mr Keating in his very first days as Prime Minister:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I want to make three commitments&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>to the Australian people. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first is I pledge to give everything I have got to the job and the country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second is to deal honestly with the people, to tell them the truth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In tough times of course the temptation is always to gild the lily. I will be resisting that temptation as much as is humanly possible. I'll speak honestly with them, to them, and realistically, and I'll listen accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA>What Mr Keating was saying was, `Forgive me for all my past lies. Now that I am the Prime Minister, now that I have grabbed office from poor Bob, trust me for the first time and expunge all my dishonesty and my untruths of the past'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, let us look at the record of this Government and  of this Prime Minister. I remind honourable senators of what he said immediately before ascending into the Lodge:</PARA>

<PARA>That was followed by the honesty of Graham Richardson:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The truth is that we were always going to challenge; the research made it legitimate.</PARA>
<PARA>Let us look at the economy according to the Prime Minister, Mr Keating. Here are some of his quotes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you look at Australia in a few years' time . . . you're going to see the Australian economy emerge as one of the most successful and balanced economics in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .       . . .       . . . </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are now well on our way back to prosperity.</PARA>
<PARA>In the Economic Statement of April 1989, the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is why . . . Labor not only claims a superior economic strategy and performance&mdash;it has proved it.</PARA>
<PARA>In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday </EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 11 March 1990, the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the next term we will see investment coming up, the capital stock going into place, the production rising, the current account declining and inflation declining. When that happens, all of this imagery will change at such a pace that I really will have, I'm sure, some difficulty dealing with the popularity breakout.</PARA>
<PARA>In an interview on radio 3AW, that same month, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No there'll be a slower year of growth, but there won't be a recession ahead.</PARA>
<PARA>In 1988, the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are now well on our way back to prosperity.</PARA>
<PARA>In March 1990, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We won't let there be a recession.</PARA>
<PARA>Then, but seven months later:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I knew there had to be a [recession] but I didn't want to tell you.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the man who says, `I am courageous enough to tell you the truth and tell it to you as it is'. Then on 5 December 1990, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This [recession] is not a condition beyond control; it is a condition in fact engineered by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA>It was Mr Reith who, on 15 May 1990 in the House of Representatives, asked the following question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Does the Treasurer agree with Senator Button's assessment that the Australian economy is in a state of severe downturn. If not, why not?</PARA>
<PARA>Rather than going through the whole answer, whereby Mr Keating disagreed with every single proposition that was put, I will just quote part of Mr Keating's answer. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But my judgment is that the economy is slowing but it has not slowed to the point where we will have&mdash;I cannot remember the words he used&mdash;a recession or&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr Hawke</EMPHASIS>&mdash;A severe downturn.</PARA>
<PARA>On 15 May 1990, we were not having a recession or even a severe downturn. Some months later we were plunged into a recession. One does not forget that it was this man who said in August 1988 on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tonight</EMPHASIS> program:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is the one which brings home the bacon.</PARA>
<PARA>In 1985 Mr Keating said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we were providing these policy settings and outcomes in Western Europe, they'd be lighting candles to us in cathedrals.</PARA>
<PARA>Two years later, in the May Economic Statement, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tonight I can report that Australia is winning.</PARA>
<PARA>Then, at last year's Premiers Conference, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The economy is now moving into the recovery phrase of the cycle.</PARA>
<PARA>Also in 1991, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The worst is now behind us.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet another of Mr Keating's statements was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These are definitely the golden years of change. Of course they are the golden years of change.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the history of this Prime Minister&mdash;call it confusion, call it doubt, call it dishonesty or call it incompetence. The truth of the matter is that this Government has never got it right and has never been prepared to tell the truth. The tragedy is that this is not the recession that we needed to have; this is the recession we needed to have because we had this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The particular tragedy of this recession is that it is so different from all those that have gone before it. On this occasion, we are seeing the burden carried by the young and, in many respects, the middle management, white-collar, middle-aged and middle income earners. Those people will wear the burden of this recession for the rest of their lives; irrespective of whether the recession finishes tomorrow, next week, next month or next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tragedy for these middle management people, these middle-aged people, these white-collar workers, is that they will probably never get another job in their lifetime; their skill, their ability and their experience are intrinsic to the company for which they have worked for probably 20 years; that is their knowledge of that company. Retrench them from that position and they are on the scrap heap. These are the men and women who are probably still paying off their mortgage, their children's school fees and mum's second car. They are now in a state of despair, doom and gloom as they confront the reality that they are unlikely to be employable again in their lifetime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a different way, the same circumstances visit the young people. There was a time when this Prime Minister was able to leave school at 14 and make his mind up as to what stream of employment he wanted to enter. When I left school, given commitment and hard work, I could decide whether I wanted to go into a profession, a trade, or the skilled work force&mdash;I had a choice. The tragedy is that the young people of Australia no longer have a choice. Thirty per cent of unemployed youth have never had a job. Many of them are confronted with years of unemployment. There are more than 350,000 Australian people who have been unemployed for 12 months. Australia has more than one million unemployed. There are more than 160,000 breadwinners who have been unemployed for longer than 12 months. More than 30 per cent of young people are unemployed as a result of the mismanagement, the incompetence and the corruption of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth of the matter was articulated by Senator Button on television on Sunday when he again said that the prognosis, as proffered and offered by this Government, shall not be that which will manifest itself at the end of this period.

The point that I made in my speech  made it absolutely relevant, and showed quite definitively, I think, that growth is measured as an increase of GDP and that there is no correlation whatsoever between the increase or decrease of GDP and jobs.

I think what the Australian people want from us and from this Parliament is a discussion about the policies most suited to dealing with the problems that they see us confronting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I made a speech in a forum in this building on Friday night about ways in which we might enhance the role of the parliament by involving it in debates about national issues in the struggle for ideas that is going on in society between the policies advocated by the Opposition and the Government, and alternative viewpoints that are not reflected in either. I have to say that the debate about this particular urgency motion and, with respect to Senator Coulter, the amendment, does not fit into that category. It is bogging us down in the semantics and in the detail. Let us get down to the policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to deal briefly with part of the detail of the motion before I get to what is behind it. Senator Button has obviously made it clear at Question Time and in his contribution that his view is that the Budget forecasts will be met.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is in a journal of record whose words I am prepared to accept. It is entirely consistent with what Senator Button said today and what he said about the evidence from business and the increased stimulus to come. The key issue before us really is not what words Senator Button, Dr Hewson, Mr Keating or Mr Reith might have used to describe projections, which are not really very far apart, about what is likely to happen in the Australian economy. The projections Dr Hewson made after the Budget and those the Government made in the Budget are very close together.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> What we really want to know is what is the likely outcome, and what are the policies likely to lead to the most favourable outcome.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An international perspective is always helpful&mdash;people outside Australia looking at how our policies are going and what our prospects are, and delivering their judgment. In the brief time available I was able to pick up two respected analysts' views. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AMEX Bank Review</EMPHASIS> of July 1992 surveyed five countries&mdash;Australia, the USA, Canada, the UK and Japan. The best prospects for a stronger performance in the next 12 months are in Australia, followed by the United States and Canada, with the UK trailing and Japan far behind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It then goes on to look at the reasons for this. It says that three real sources of economic growth in the Australian economy give us the best prospects. They are consumer confidence, fiscal policy and, overwhelmingly, monetary policy. We have a contrast between Government and Opposition in those areas. In the area of consumer confidence I think there is room for speculation about whether there would be differences between Government and Opposition. It depends on one's view about the GST, which is an issue I am happy to debate but which takes us off the subject.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of fiscal policy and monetary policy there is no room for doubt about the distinction. The Opposition says there should not be fiscal stimulus, and the independent bank review says quite clearly that that is a plus for economic growth in Australia. I think every responsible economic commentator says that, at this stage in the economic cycle, it is the appropriate and responsible thing to do to provide fiscal stimulus. Other governments of much more conservative political persuasions are doing the same, including the liberal-democratic party government of Japan, the conservative party in the United Kingdom and the conservative government in Canada. On monetary policy the United States, Canada and Australia all get double pluses for very stimulatory monetary policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition strongly resisted the initial decisions by the Government to lower monetary policy. Dr Hewson strongly opposed those decisions and said they were just political&mdash;just designed as a matter of politics, not good economics. He did not think we should have been reducing interest rates when we did, and he opposed the first few of those reductions. All the objective evidence is that it is clear there would be an increase in interest rates under the Opposition's policy, for reasons which others have articulated and which I have not got time to do today. It is clear that the American Express Bank says that Australia has the best prospects of recovery of any of the major economies it surveyed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not only Amex. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Economist</EMPHASIS> on 8 August surveyed the 13 leading world economies of which Australia is one. It took a poll of forecasters around the world and asked, `Which economies do you think will perform the best in the next two years?' In 1992, which economy did they predict would have the best economic results? Australia. In 1993, which of those 13 leading economies did they think would have the best result in the world? Australia. That is not to say they think that happy days are here again and there will be no problems again. They are saying 2.5 per cent for 1992 and 3.7 per cent for 1993. When one thinks about that, it quite clearly says they are predicting about 3 per cent for 1992-93&mdash;the Budget prediction. More importantly, their prediction is that Australia will be the most successful of all those economies in terms of economic growth for the next two years because of the policy of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is need to do more&mdash;that is not a ground for complacency&mdash;but it is an indication that we do not have to hang our heads in shame. The world is in an economic slow-down and it is very hard for any country to grow quickly within a world economy growing very slowly, but within the limits imposed by that international constraint, we are doing, comparatively, very well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at some of the major forecasters in Australia. They have, as the Government has reflected in its projections during the first half of this year, revised down their growth assessments a little. Both the bodies I will quote&mdash;Westpac and the Commonwealth Bank&mdash;have revised down their growth forecasts for 1992-93. What are they predicting now? Westpac is forecasting for 1992, 1.7 per cent and for 1993, 4 per cent. That is slightly down on what they were predicting before, but when you think about what it reflects for the average for 1992-93, it is about 3 per cent. They are saying, essentially, that the Government's predictions are on track but the growth will be more in the second half of the year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The August 1992 <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economic Newsletter</EMPHASIS> of the Commonwealth Bank says that the Government's projection for 1992-93 is too conservative and that, in fact, growth will be 3.3 per cent. That is revised down on the bank's previous estimate. We have all underestimated the nature of the international effect and probably put too much confidence on a rural upturn that has not yet been reflected this season. Growth prospects are not as good as we thought at the start of the year, but the general consensus is that 3 per cent is certainly not ambitious; it is on the modest end of the range of industry predictions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not surprising because if we look at the secondary indicators, at the indicators that suggest where growth is going, where the economy is going, they all suggest that there is a modest recovery under way, that the fundamentals are right. The most worrying and difficult of the economic criteria relates to jobs. This area has the most profound social consequences. It is always the slowest to recover from a recession. The job figures are the last to fall, but also the last to rise. Disturbing and worrying as those figures are&mdash;nobody can underestimate the problem&mdash;the employment trend is clearly up and there are tentative signs that the job advertisements are starting to increase. The figures are indicating an improvement. That is exactly what one would expect, because the figures are showing that GDP has been growing since June of last year and also that gross non-farm product is growing strongly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at other figures, like the trend line of the turnover of retail establishments since June of 1991 or that of motor vehicle registrations or dwelling approvals, each of these bounces up and down month by month for a variety of seasonal reasons and, when they are seasonally adjusted, for a variety of statistical reasons because they are sampling. But the trend line is clearly positive. Even in those areas that have been very slow to improve, like manufacturing production and new capital expenditure, the seasonally adjusted indications are that the first signs of improvement are emerging. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course everybody wishes the growth rates were higher. I think even Opposition members wish the rates were higher. They have a political wish that they were not, but they are citizens; they would like to see their friends and relations able to get jobs too. Perhaps I am being too positive about them. There are those who think those opposite sit over there, as Senator Button once so beautifully described it, `buoyant with gloom'. I would be the last to say that about them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear that the tentative signs of improvement are there. It is also quite clear that we wish growth rates were higher and that we should be doing more to stimulate the economy. That is why the significant issue is not what Senator Button said on Sunday; it is what the respective policies of the alternative governments suggest for the future of the Australian economy. It is why it is very important that we continue with monetary policy that continues to provide stimulus. That is what we have, because we can deliver low inflation and therefore we can deliver low interest rates and people who wish to invest can do so at a low cost of money. That is not possible if one introduces a GST in these circumstances and jacks up the price levels. Even if, in the most optimistic expectations, one can get it out in 12 months&mdash;I do not share that view, but let us assume it is right&mdash;it has a temporary impact and it means one is asking people to lend money at a negative rate of return; that is, if the Opposition is going to keep the rate of interest as it is now, and it will not do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need a stimulatory fiscal policy, not a proposal to cut $6 billion to $10 billion out of government outlays and reduce the government stimulus from the economy&mdash;the classic prescription of the 1930s which has not been adopted by anybody since. Not even Margaret Thatcher adopted that policy. We need a recognition of the role of wages policy in generating economic growth and we need a balanced approach to tariff policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had a lot of speculation that the people who criticise Fightback are some sort of left wing conspirators. It may be that all those banks I cited earlier are part of a left wing conspiracy; it may be that the Australian Bureau of Statistics&mdash;which showed all that data about the improvement in the indicators&mdash;is part of the left wing conspiracy. Maybe even Mr Ian Macphee, who said that the Opposition's policy has been hijacked by right wing think tanks, is part of a left wing conspiracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a proposal that the Federal Liberal Party's Fightback package of economic reforms is to cost tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs. I do not think the architect of that is a member of any left wing conspiracy because that comes from the Leader of the Liberal Party in South Australia. That is why we need to be concerned not about who said what to whom yesterday. We need to be worried about whose policies are more capable of providing economic growth for Australia into the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the stark contrast in monetary policy, fiscal policy, wages policy and tariff policy. It is who has those policies to create jobs for tomorrow. Growth is under way; we have been growing for quite some time, but we are growing too slowly and we need to give more stimulus to the economy. That is the choice. That is what the debate in this Parliament should be about. It is a pity we continually get diverted by these semantic quibbles about who said what to whom yesterday. It is of great fascination to those opposite; it is the contemporary equivalent of how many angels can dance on the head of a pin. Let us get the Parliament back to the issues that worry the people out there in the street, and that relates to whose policies are most likely to create jobs for today and tomorrow. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have sat here for 15 minutes listening to Senator McMullan telling us that his monetary and fiscal policy was correct and&mdash;he did not quite say that, but using his Leader's words&mdash;that `it had saved Australia'. I ask Senator McMullan to tell the people of Australia&mdash;if his monetary and fiscal policies have been so successful&mdash;why there are now almost two million of our fellow Australians unable to get the hours of work that they need. Why are almost one million of our fellow Australians officially on the unemployment queues? If Senator McMullan's Government has done so well with its monetary and fiscal policies, why are we in the mess we are in? Why are we, to use the words of Senator Walsh, in an economy that has been `stuffed'? I ask Senator McMullan to explain that to the people of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McMullan did mention the consumption tax, the GST. I found his words on that subject very amusing, seeing it was only a few short years ago that his Leader, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), was the leading protagonist for a consumption tax. His Leader argued the subject very, very well. Some of Mr Keating's words are words that I use when I go around the countryside promoting the GST, because he promoted it so well in 1985; but we was snowed, he was done over by the ACTU for purely political reasons. He knew it was right economically but he caved in for political reasons. </PARA>

I was not trying to be rude to Senator Button; I was only trying to be helpful. I was trying to get him away from the stress from which he is obviously suffering these days in trying to continually cover up for the ridiculous statements that Mr Keating continues to make, and in some way trying to rationalise and make reasonable some of the more outrageous statements that Mr Keating makes. I was only trying to help Senator Button in suggesting that he might, having announced his retirement, take it early so that he would not be put into this stressful situation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is essential that those statements be exposed. I refer to the statement made by Mr Keating, `The fact is that this Government has saved Australia'. Tell that to the one million unemployed. Tell that to those whose whole life savings have been ruined by this Government in bankruptcy. And that further statement by Mr Keating, again breathtaking in its arrogance and hypocrisy, `We were out of the recession long ago'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those statements have to be exposed for the recognition of the people of Australia. They are just two statements in a long line of breathtakingly deceitful statements from this Government&mdash;statements like, `No child will live in poverty'; `There will be no recession; We will not let there be a recession'. Statements like that made by the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, the head of this Government, who said, `I will be leading you at the next election', just a short time after he had promised Mr Keating and his union mates that he would step aside and give Mr Keating the Prime Ministership. That sort of breathtaking hypocrisy and deceitfulness must be exposed to this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statement by Mr Keating, that the recession finished long ago, is a cruel hoax. Such statements are a cruel hoax on the unemployed, small business, tourist operators, farmers and welfare agencies because they give the unemployed some wrongful hope for the future. The despair that they suffer daily is wrongfully dealt with by Mr Keating. The unemployed are given some hope when Mr Keating knows they have none. They are given a false sense of hopefulness&mdash;something that they might be able to look forward to, and it is entirely false. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a cruel hoax on small businessmen who want to expand, who want to try to get their businesses going, who might happen to believe that the recession is finished and might want to get ahead. It is a cruel hoax on tourist operators who are looking for the people driving up to their resorts and do not see them coming. They wonder what is happening when Mr Keating has said he has saved Australia, when Mr Keating has said the recession is finished but there are no more people coming to their tourist facilities. And it is a cruel hoax on the welfare agencies, the people who hope to have some relief from the daily despair that they see of people whose lives have been absolutely shattered by the actions of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How do we know that it is a cruel hoax? We know it is now a cruel hoax because Senator Button exposed it on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program. As Senator Button said on that program:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'm not absolutely confident that we will attain those Budget forecasts.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Button has exposed Mr Keating for what he is, but he is not the only one. Senator Button has this record, as Mr Dawkins said, of making these statements. On 29 May 1990, when talking about Government estimates, Senator Button said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is pretty clear to anybody who can do arithmetic that the Budget forecasts in respect of the current account deficit cannot be met.</PARA>
<PARA>So it is certainly not the first time that Senator Button has made those statements which have tried to put some realism into the exaggerated statements that Mr Keating has made. Senator Walsh, who follows me in this debate, has also exposed the Government for its hypocrisy in the statements it has made. Not too long ago Senator Walsh said&mdash;and no doubt he will mention it himself in his speech&mdash;that Labor had `stuffed Australia's economy' and he warned the Government that the One Nation statement was based on rubbery figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 31 March this year in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, Senator Walsh said he doubted whether the Government's growth forecasts of more than 4 per cent could be taken seriously. On one of the Government's proposals he further said that the decision to spend an additional $602m on roads over three years was suspect, adding that the original so-called black spots road program was opinion poll driven. He further said that Mr Keating was deluding himself by refusing to believe Australia was heading for a recession up to the end of 1990 and he suggested the Prime Minister did not really believe in the decision not to reverse the ban on mining at Coronation Hill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Walsh is quoted further as saying that the tax cuts could not be underwritten by the 4 per cent plus growth forecasts in One Nation. He said, `That was the figure which was cited, but I doubt that it should be taken seriously'. So there was Senator Walsh as well exposing the untruthfulness of these statements by Mr Keating. If one needs any further exposition, one has only to look at the facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1991-92 Budget there was a growth forecast of 1.5 per cent, which came down in the One Nation statement to zero per cent. In the 1991-92 Budget there was a deficit forecast of $4.7 billion, which in the One Nation statement increased to $6.8 billion. In the 1991-92 Budget the result was $9.3 billion. So it went from $4.7 billion to $6.8 billion to an actual of $9.3 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1992-93 Budget the growth was forecast at 3 per cent, although Senator Button is now calling that into doubt. In the One Nation statement, of course, it was forecast at 4.75 per cent. In the One Nation statement the deficit was forecast at $8 billion and in the 1992-93 Budget the deficit was forecast at $13.4 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So one can understand why Senator Button and other people on the Labor side are confused as to which estimates might be right. One can understand why Senator Button comes out and exposes the crueler hoaxes of Mr Keating when he talks about the recession being finished. It is necessary and urgent that we expose these expectations of growth and jobs for the hoaxes they are because the Australian people must understand the lies and the misinformation&mdash;deliberate untruths&mdash;that this Government is perpetrating on the Australian public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It really does not need much going back in history to look at the statements that Mr Keating has made. Going right back to 1983-84, when he was talking about the Budget, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be a considerable improvement in the coming year. </PARA>

<PARA>And further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is the one that brings home the bacon.</PARA>

<PARA>But the facts were that our foreign debt rose to $117 billion and 7,435 businesses became bankrupt. And he later said in the 1989-90 Budget Speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of the Government's economic policies Australia will emerge from the recent high level of spending without a recession and with its economic and social structures improving.</PARA>
<PARA>And following that, the unemployment rate rose from 6 per cent to 7.3 per cent and another 122,000 Australians joined the dole queue. And so it went on. In the 1990-91 Budget Speech, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This year our financial situation will markedly improve without the misery and despair of high unemployment and a savage recession.</PARA>
<PARA>That was just in 1990 and in that year the unemployment rate rose from 7.3 per cent to 9.8 per cent and another 225,000 Australians joined the dole queue. So how can one believe anything that this Government says?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a need to expose these statements because people do take notice of them.

<PARA>Returning to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program, about three years ago I began to ask myself: why do politicians keep going on that program?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question that I then put to myself still puzzles me: why do politicians go on that program when they know that the whole of Canberra's press gallery and a number of people outside Canberra, if they do not actually watch the program, get a video of it, read the transcripts and search through diligently to see whether they can find one loose line, one loose sentence or even a loose phrase which they can then take out of context and beat up in all Monday morning's newspapers, on the ABC <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> program and all the rest of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sunday is usually a pretty slack news day and those journalists habitually feed off the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program. What gets published on Monday is at best a gross exaggeration and, indeed, often if viewed in context, a complete misrepresentation because journalists focus not on the entire content of a 10-minute interview but one thoughtless line or a loose or imprecise sentence. Senator Button himself has acknowledged that he should and could have put the point he was making better and more clearly than he did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, as everybody knows that that is the case with the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program and the press reporting of it, why did those opposite move this urgency motion today? The answer to that, I suggest, is that they knew Michelle Grattan would bucket them and say that they were a bunch of dills if they did not&mdash;and she probably would be right. But, because those opposite have moved this motion, Michelle will not bucket them tomorrow and say that they are a bunch of dills because they let Senator Button get away with this loose line and did not try to beat it up into something much more important than in fact it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The subject, in so far as it does have any context in the debate, is of course economic forecasts or the type of economic forecasts that are contained in Budgets. Economic forecasting at any time is an imprecise science, even in Budget-type forecasting which is rarely projected more than 12 months ahead. Long term economic forecasting, defined as 10 years or more, is sophistry or worse. Indeed, taking money for long term forecasting is tantamount to theft because, by the time the forecaster is proved wrong, everybody has forgotten the content of the forecasts anyway and whoever received the money is no longer in business. I repeat: taking money for long term forecasting is tantamount to theft. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I do not imply that there is absolutely no merit in forecasting or in attempting to make forecasts or in attempting to measure economic variables after the event. That leads me to the amendment moved by the Democrats which wants to trade off the imperfection of economic forecasting for the imprecision and warm cuddly nonsense of trying to embrace within it things which cannot be measured&mdash;and of course the Government will not be accepting that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Treasury has often been wrong with its economic forecasts, sometimes quite seriously wrong.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When 11 months ago the then Treasurer John Kerin at a press conference was asked, `Has the recession ended?' or some question like that, he answered, `Your guess is as good as mine'. He got ridiculed for that answer, but it was in fact a very sensible and honest one to make because at that stage nobody knew for certain whether, even in the technical sense, we had moved out of the recession&mdash;that is, having had two consecutive quarters of positive economic growth&mdash;but we do now know that, shortly after Mr Kerin said that, we had in the technical sense moved out of the recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having knocked back numerous invitations to poke my face in front of a microphone and/or a camera and adjudicate on this alleged discrepancy between Senator Button's view of the world and that of Mr Dawkins or the Prime Minister or someone, I was asked today by a journalist, `Do you think that the growth forecasts will be met?'&mdash;that is, in this financial year. I said, `Your guess is as good as mine'. Then I thought again and said, `No, your guess is probably better because you have been studying the recent economic statistics more diligently than I have'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sure, in the lifetime of this Government there have been a number of Budget forecasts which have differed quite substantially from the Budget outcomes. Foremost among those, I hasten to point out, is that until the last two financial years the bottom line of the Budget, the deficit or surplus, whichever way we like to look at it, came out much more favourably&mdash;that is, if the objective is to improve the Commonwealth's financial position&mdash;than the forecasts which were made at the time the Budget was introduced had anticipated. But it predates this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard a fair bit about Budget deficits from Senator Macdonald, I think it was. The last Budget brought down by the Liberal Party&mdash;the disgraceful 1982 Budget which was bereft of any sort of economic strategy, which contained only a political strategy which consisted of a sequence of bribes designed to buy off every pressure group in sight in the hope that the Liberals could get themselves past the next election&mdash;forecast a deficit of $1.7 billion; the outcome was $4.9 billion. It almost trebled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know whether that was actually a Treasury estimate because that Budget was hijacked by PM&amp;C under the direction of Malcolm Fraser. However, it was certainly dishonest. I just do not believe that this was ever a Treasury estimate. The notorious section 10BA film concession was introduced as part of the 1982 Budget at an estimated cost of $2m a year. As I recall, that ultimately blew out to about $150m a year before the Labor Government cleaned it up. It also said that unemployment would peak at about 8 per cent when in fact it peaked at 10.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover&mdash;and this is very important&mdash;if the public is to understand Federal Government budgeting, and if ongoing discipline is to be applied to it, they must understand that no government had published Forward Estimates of outlays until this Government was elected in 1983. It published Forward Estimates of outlays in the first year and has continued to do so ever since. Even if a subsequent government of a different party should want to revert to the dark, old days of Fraser, when everyone was kept in the dark because it made it easier to lie to them before the next election, it will not be able to avoid the degree of disclosure that is entailed in the publication of Forward Estimates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again just before the last election, in the very week of the poll, the then Fraser Government was still insisting that the impending Budget deficit for the following financial year&mdash;that is, 1983-84&mdash;was $6 billion. Of course, John Stone had told the then Government, in a minute which was subsequently published, that the impending deficit was in fact almost $10 billion, or 5 per cent of GDP&mdash;a record level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Returning briefly to the Democrat amendment, it is incongruous to say the least&mdash;I will be as polite as I can&mdash;that the Democrats should be expressing concern about high levels of unemployment on the very same day that they gave notice of a motion the effect of which, if implemented, would be to close down about half of the timber industry. They cannot have it both ways. If they want to close down half of the timber industry, they cannot expect anybody to take them seriously when they pretend to be concerned about unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even more startling was the denial by the Democrat leader that there is a linkage between economic growth and the level of employment. Has he never noticed that when economic growth turns negative, unemployment goes up? It does not always go down when economic growth turns positive, because a threshold has to be reached before unemployment goes down following economic growth going up. But whenever economic growth goes down, unemployment goes up. I would have thought that even the Democrats might have noticed that. It is truly mind-blowing that he should deny any linkage between economic growth and the level of employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chamarette did not speak on this matter today, but she delivered some pious notice of motion as well.

But, no, Senator Chamarette will not be advocating that, of course, because some of the new class spivs who vote for her also use that road to come into Perth five days a week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The members of the Liberal Party will stop laughing now because it is their turn. It is also a bit hypocritical for the Liberal Party to talk about its concern for unemployment when it proposes to bring in its goods and services tax, or, more accurately, its value added tax. It proposes to do that, should it win the next election, in just under two years time, on 1 October 1994. If a Liberal government, should one be elected, manages to sustain growth, that is just about the period when we are likely to be drifting into another balance of payments crisis; that is, if we have reasonably high growth between now and then. If we are not actually in one, we will be drifting perilously close to one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What would the Liberal Party do? There would be a major loosening of fiscal policy&mdash;major tax cuts, which will not be funded because there is a $6 billion hole in their arithmetic, and a 5 per cent boost in the CPI. The only way we would be able to control the haemorrhaging current account and the inflationary pressures which the Liberals' policy would generate would be to have another credit squeeze. In other words, interest rates would be at 20 per cent&mdash;a repeat of the mistake that was made in 1989. If the honourable senators opposite are really concerned about employment and unemployment, they should get rid of their GST. That means they will have to get rid of their leader as well, but they are probably thinking about that anyway. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a report from the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, which is a body that hears applications by people who feel that they have not been properly treated by the Department of Social Security. It does quite outstanding work. It is a body which hears matters in a relaxed, inexpensive and expeditious fashion and it does good work. Appeals from it go to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, which handles them very well. I would hate the Senate to simply pass over this opportunity of giving some credit where credit is due. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice in appendix 3 of the report that there is a list of the personnel who staff the Tribunal; there is the national convener, Anne Coghlan, and senior members in the various States. I note that in Melbourne, for example, Deirdre FitzGerald has performed quite outstandingly, not only in this Tribunal but also in others. I highlight those two people. I notice that Terry Carney, who originally came from Melbourne, is now in Sydney. I do not want to pick out any more because they are all worthy of great praise. Once again, I acknowledge the great service of this Tribunal. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the 1991-92 annual report of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. The 1991-92 financial year was a very busy one for the Tribunal. As a result of a number of factors, not the least being the effects of the recession that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) claimed we had to have, the number of applications to the SSAT during 1991-92 was 33 per cent higher than in the previous year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As is noted on page 1 of its annual report, the Tribunal managed to increase its output during this period by 19 per cent. It deserves to be congratulated for this fact, particularly when it is recognised that staff resources increased by less than 4 per cent during the financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The SSAT also deserves the Senate's commendation for managing to improve the overall time for finalising appeals from 10.5 weeks in the previous year to 9.8 weeks in 1991-92. However, by the end of the 1991-92 financial year, it was becoming fairly obvious that the Appeal Tribunal's added workload was getting almost too much. The average time for the finalisation of cases had risen to 10.9 weeks. The number of cases not finalised at the end of the 1991-92 financial year was 81 per cent higher than in the previous year. The Tribunal was not able to maintain its 21-day standard for the provision of hearing applicants, with an average of 24.8 days between the date of appointment and the hearing to be held. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These figures indicate that the SSAT may have a resources problem. In its annual report, the Tribunal admits that this is a possibility when it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we have only to look at the vast increase in workload this year to see that it is imperative to have a structure that is flexible enough to meet fluctuating demands.</PARA>
<PARA>Thankfully, in terms of its resources problem, there are two factors which the SSAT can look forward to in the coming year. First, a resources review is currently being undertaken at the direction of a steering committee chaired Professor Cheryl Saunders, which I am informed will develop a workload model that will be used to adjust the resources for the SSAT in light of the workload. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, in the 1992 Budget, the Government decided to provide compulsory reviews by the Department of Social Security authorised review officers. It is estimated that these additional reviews by the Department will result in more than 3,000 fewer appeals spread across all program areas to the SSAT each year. However, partially offsetting these factors will be the growing number of reviews by the SSAT of decisions taken by the Commonwealth Employment Service in relation to Newstart and the Jobsearch allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As at 30 June 1992, 14 per cent of all the Tribunal's decisions related to applications for reviews of CES decisions. By 16 December 1992, CES related reviews had grown to nearly 18 per cent of the Tribunal's total workload, with nearly 60 per cent of all unemployment related reviews emanating from CES decisions. Not only are CES cases becoming more commonplace for the SSAT, but these cases are also adding to the Tribunal's workload as well as to the cost of cases. Each CES case involves two departments rather than one, which means that the Tribunal often must receive submissions from, and liaise with, both departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In answers provided to me during the recent Estimates hearings, and in chapter 7 of this annual report, the Tribunal recognised that it received many cases where the CES had cancelled a benefit due to a person failing to attend an interview. In an extremely high proportion of cases, these decisions to cancel were set aside because the Tribunal found that applicants had a reasonable excuse for not attending the interview in accordance with the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is disturbing that, in such cases, the SSAT often found that the CES appeared to address only the issue of whether the person had attended the interview and not whether the person had a reasonable excuse for not attending, as is required by the legislation. In fact, in some cases, the Tribunal commented that the CES was not able to supply copies of correspondence or satisfactory evidence of postage, nor did it give details of a client's history. I find this matter disturbing because it shows how a government department's sloppy administration and mediocre interpretation of the law is obviously resulting in an even higher workload for the SSAT than it really ought to have, if what the SSAT is saying is correct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I await the results of the review of the SSAT's resources and trust that these results will be provided to me on the conclusion of the review. I commend the Government for attempting to lighten the burden of cases coming before the SSAT by providing an additional review by authorised review officers in the Department of Social Security. But I urge the CES to look at the concerns that have been raised in this report. </PARA>

<PARA>Part (c) of the terms of reference states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">whether sections 45D and 45E now provide adequate protection against secondary boycotts&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I come to the very particular reason for expressing it in this way, where the last part of the sentence reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in particular, for small businesses, and the alternative means to provide such protection.</PARA>
<PARA>The motion suggests that the Committee report by the end of May 1993. At first glance, such a date may appear to be so far into the future as to provide a buffer for the debate to reach a succinct and effective conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a matter which was first drawn to my personal and political attention soon after I became the Australian Democrats' spokesperson for industrial relations, just before Christmas 1991. At that stage the shuffling positions with regard to sections 45D and 45E had been going on for many years already. My contribution was to be part of the process which was examining a path for the transference of sections 45D and 45E away from the Trade Practices Act and into a more logical cocoon or collection within the industrial relations ambit. After months of negotiation and discussion between the various affected parties it proved to be too difficult a task for the Government to achieve with the package that was proposed just before Christmas last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With that experience, I suggest that there is more to this than meets the eye. It is not a superficial matter at all. It requires concerted and considerable discussion by a wide variety of groups, especially if my suggested terms of reference are to include consideration of what means of protection from secondary boycotts might be provided for small businesses. That is not an easy matter to resolve. I propose that this matter be given a comprehensive inquiry, not a superficial one by any means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The attempts to deal with this matter have been several and unsuccessful to date. I believe that this matter should not be prolonged. I believe that it must be addressed. In discussions with members of trade unions, people who are practising employers and people who are practising individual small businesses&mdash;those aspects of our community who are most affected by these measures&mdash;I have received total agreement that this is a contentious part of the Trade Practices Act and also that it needs to be considered in depth and resolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the period that I have been involved with this I have found that of all the aspects of industrial relations practice&mdash;I do not say law because this is not part of industrial relations law&mdash;this particular little bundle of legislation has great mystique and little practical understanding. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7U4">Senator BELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Its effectiveness lies not in its particular legislative procedure, but rather in the threat of its application. Perhaps that threat of application has attached to it as much mystique as actuality. I think that it is time that mystique is removed, that we find out what we are dealing with and examine, as I propose in the terms of reference, whether sections 45D and 45E now provide adequate protection against secondary boycotts, in particular for small businesses, and whether there be alternative means to provide such protection.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are notorious threatened applications of sections 45D and 45E which are directed not against industrial action but against other actions taken by other groups. We are familiar with the problematical threat of application of these sections to community groups such as Greenpeace, which, in conducting actions which can hardly be termed as industrial actions, have had the threat of running foul of this section. It is as much for that reason that the Democrats have as a priority in their policy that sections 45D and 45E should not be within the Trade Practices Act but rather that we should seek other means of addressing this particular problem. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition will not support this motion. The reason came through very clearly in Senator Bell's final words. Having started off by saying that he was referring this matter to a committee so that it could be sorted out to decide what is the best way to protect innocent people against secondary boycotts, he then went on to say in his closing remarks that it was his view and the view of the Democrats that it should not be part of the Trade Practices Act. This was basically the intent of referring it to a committee. I do not know what the Government believes about this, but I think it would be very foolish to support it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act are colloquially known as the Howard amendments to the Trade Practices Act. They were introduced in 1977 by then Minister, John Howard, for a very specific purpose. They were to protect innocent people against thuggery and standover by very powerful unions, almost in a mafia-like way, to threaten them to do something that some other union wished would occur. As a secondary boycott, it does not involve a direct dispute between an employer and his or her employees. It represents action done by a third party, specifically a union, which in the main would have no relationship whatsoever with the employer or his employees. In most cases I understand that the union which was threatening the secondary boycott did not have any members of its union in the organisation where there was a dispute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major effect of sections 45D and 45E is that they have been a deterrent. No-one would disagree with that because there have been very few instances where sections 45D and 45E have been implemented. I will refer to one later in this debate. </PARA>

That was the threat made by the then President of the ACTU to try to get Mr Howard to desist. He did not. Over 15 years it has served this country very well. There are many Labor people and many people involved in the trade unions, maybe even Senator McKiernan, who have had a long history of trade unions, who deep within their hearts would hope that sections 45D and 45E stay where they are. Senator McKiernan has to smile and shake his head, otherwise he would lose it. Perhaps the Government is committed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to the suspension of the sitting for dinner, we were discussing the motion moved by the Australian Democrats to refer sections 45D and 45E to the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. I had indicated that sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act are what are commonly called the Howard amendments. They were introduced to stop belligerent and militant trade unions from quite unfairly attacking small and medium sized organisations in a way equivalent to the sort of tactic that one would expect from the mafia rather than a civilised society. That legislation has now been in place for something like 15 years and has proved very effective, not because it has been used very often but simply because it acts as a deterrent to those who would otherwise engage in this quite obnoxious practice of secondary boycotts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned earlier that I would give a little example because in the late 1970s I was somewhat involved in the shipments of coking coal into the European steel mills. Up until that time, the majority of our coking coal was sold into Asia, mainly into Japan, and it was thought wise to diversify, in the same way that the Japanese diversify their own supply sources. One of the difficulties we encountered back in the 1970s, because of OPEC pricing and so on, was an incredibly volatile shipping market. It was thought that a way around this&mdash;not as a method of making money, because there is no way to, or we could not, make money from large size vessels&mdash;was to predict the freight rate between Australia and Europe. In the absence of that predictability, the market that we were attempting to build up to diversify Australian resources could not survive. In the process, some eight ships were purchased, mainly second-hand, and they were generally named after lakes around the world. They were crewed by Spanish seamen, which is not unusual in the bulk trades because the Spanish have a long history going back hundreds of years&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Going back to Christopher Columbus, as Senator Cooney says. The Spanish have a tradition of being great seamen. However, the Seamen's Union of Australian decided that its members should man the ships. It must be understood that to bring back empty these large 100,000-tonne vessels, which go full from Australia to Europe, would be a quick way to go broke; therefore, some methods had to be worked out so they could be partly loaded for part of the way back from Europe. One method used was to pick up oil in the Middle East and bring it into places such as Port Stanvac in South Australia. When <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lake Berryessa</EMPHASIS> arrived at Port Stanvac it was basically arrested by the trade unions and impounded, where it sat idle for something like six months. The only way in which that situation could have been addressed&mdash;it was clearly a secondary boycott&mdash;was to invoke sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make it very clear that we had nothing whatsoever against the use of Australian seamen if they had been competitive with other ships around the world. If we are not competitive with other vessels, then there is no way in the world that we can continue to compete. That market into Europe where some 25 per cent or 30 per cent of our coking coal was being diversified would have come to nought. From the point of view of lost sales, not only would that have been a disaster for the Australian mining industry but also would have been a disaster for the viability of supply. So it was a very vital action which took place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sections 45D and 45E were invoked. This meant a fairly lengthy court case. Eventually, the seamen's union released the vessel which it had held illegally for six months. The net effect was that the company involved decided that it was not worth taking the risk of building up a merchant navy, which at that time everyone wanted, which we should have in Australia today and which, with the passage of time, with a bit of commonsense, we may have been able to maintain and expand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can recall very well the then president of the seamen's union, Elliott V. Elliott, making the remark in front of the judge hearing the case that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lake Berryessa</EMPHASIS> could actually stay in Port Stanvac until the bottom fell out of the ship. That was the sort of aggressive attitude of these people in the union who, in time, cut off their noses to spite their faces. With that sort of attitude, no-one I knew was brave enough to contemplate putting vessels onto the international market. That is a very sad reflection. The point is that it was only through sections 45D and 45E that there could have been some resolution; otherwise Mr Elliott V. Elliott would have been right and the ship would have stayed in port until the bottom fell out of the ship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that the action I initiated under section 45D never came to a conclusion. The point I made earlier was that, by the section being there, it acted as a deterrent in the future. Those who pursued this illegal action thought twice before doing so because of the potential damages that they themselves would incur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This whole question of sections 45D and 45E has come up a number of times. Back in 1984, the Government, in an agreement with the unions on accord mark one, I presume it was in those days, agreed to get rid of sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act. It was debated in this place at great length. It is very interesting to note the comments of the Australian Democrats, led at that time by former Senator Chipp. Their spokesperson at that time was former Senator Jack Evans. He made the point, with all the toing and froing that goes on in this place, that the Democrats would not support the removal of sections 45D and 45E. In a debate that took place on 8 October 1984, Senator Jack Evans said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we protect the interests not of the heavy pressure groups, but, for instance, the interests of small business people. . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is a very telling remark, because probably the most important aspect of section 45D is that it did protect the interests of small business people who could have been up until that stage singled out for belligerent attention. It is my belief that probably thousands of man hours have been saved in this country as a result of the existence of sections 45D and 45E. Former Senator Siddons, in a similar debate on 21 August 1985, made the remark:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1984 the Government introduced legislation to repeal sections 45D and E of the Trade Practices Act.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the commitment under the accord. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government was unable in 1984 to give the Democrats adequate guarantees for the protection of small business and innocent third parties.</PARA>
<PARA>The two key phrases are `small business people' and `innocent third parties'. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a consequence the Democrats opposed the repeal of those two sections.</PARA>
<PARA>As I mentioned earlier, I believe that if the truth were known responsible people in the Labor Party were relieved when the Government could not meet the accord mark one promise. They know and I know and the business people are aware that those two pieces of vital legislation have helped not only our domestic industrial relations scene but also our reliability on world markets as a result of similar examples to that which I quoted in regard to the famous <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lake Berryessa</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also notice that in the motion on the reference to the Committee, the Australian Democrats talk about sections 45D and 45E being `unduly harsh and restrictive'. How on earth can these sections be unduly harsh and restrictive when they refer to something that is quite clearly illegal! It is not as if we are talking about disputes within an organisation between the employer and employee, some of which could be classified as legitimate. It is not as if we are talking about the right to strike. We are not. The right to strike comes when a person or a group of people in an organisation perceive an injustice and they talk about their right to withdraw their labour. That has nothing to do with this. This is no more or less than an attack by a group of unions who are trying to coerce an employer to capitulate because the direction in which that particular organisation is going does not happen to suit them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also notice here&mdash;and I find this quite fascinating&mdash;that they somehow link into this request, as part of their terms of reference, the `right to free speech apparently implicit in Australia's Constitution'. What an extraordinary statement! This refers to the ad ban Bill and the High Court decision where the Chief Justice of the High Court&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I was making is that the Chief Justice of the High Court made it very clear that it was to do with parliamentary representation. I believe he went to great lengths to point out that one could not draw a long bow and say that this referred to some bill of rights or whatever. The judgment, in regard to all the judges, referred to political free speech, and to somehow lock into the High Court decision last week something to do with sections 45D and 45E is beyond belief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next term of reference, item (b), talks about `a worker's right to withdraw labour'. I think I touched on that by saying that sections 45D and 45E have no relevance whatsoever to that point. The next term of reference, item (c), talks about `whether sections 45D and 45E now provide adequate protection against secondary boycotts'. I suppose Senator Bell will clarify this, but I presume that the Democrats are saying that there was a time when sections 45D and 45E did provide adequate protection against secondary boycotts, in particular, for small business. He is now asking whether that still occurs. Yes, it still occurs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bell mentioned in his opening remarks that this legislation was contentious and notorious in the field of industrial relations. I have not heard a peep about that in recent years. I have no doubt that if one talks to some of the left wing militant trade union leaders, they will raise it. The reason for their fury at the time about the Howard amendment to the trade practices legislation was that it reduced their power base; it reduced their ability to exercise power over others. In the main, those others that they were exercising the power over were the innocent people within an industrial dispute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for these reasons that the Opposition will not support this reference. We believe it is mischievous. It could be that because the Democrats have lost a lot of support, mainly from the civil libertarians in society&mdash;who were appalled and shocked by their approach to the ban on electronic advertising of political matter&mdash;that they are now looking to pick up that little skerrick&mdash;I do not know how little or big it is&mdash;of support from the left wing trade union groups. Maybe the Democrats think that with this sort of approach they will pick up the support of people like John Halfpenny. I hate to use this term, because Senator Baume has used it so often in recent times, but let me say that pigs might fly. What will happen is that the Democrats will get exactly the same treatment from these union people at an election as they have always received in the past. In other words, they are being drawn into a matter which I believe has been to the great benefit of this country&mdash;most thinking people on all sides of politics will agree to that&mdash;and they are talking about reference to a committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A remark has been made by Senator Bell that the Committee should report by the end of May 1993. We in the Opposition are opposed to that because we strongly believe in the positive benefits that have accrued to this nation because of sections 45D and 45E. If the Government agrees with the Democrats and refers this matter to the Committee, it will be of great benefit to people on this side of politics because all those people who feel so strongly about the protection given to them as innocent third parties will, I am sure, be only too pleased to give evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I reiterate that the Opposition opposes this reference for no other reason than that we believe it has been of great benefit to the Australian community. It has benefited not just employers&mdash;small, medium or large&mdash;but also those responsible elements in the trade union movement who did not engage and have never engaged in secondary boycotts. I think they were rather pleased with the fact that their more militant brothers&mdash;or perhaps I should call them comrades&mdash;did engage in that because in the process they helped give the union movement the bad name that it has today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in the debate on Senator Bell's reference to sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act and to move an amendment which seeks to change the reporting date:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Paragraph 3, omit "the end of May 1993", substitute "the last sitting day in November 1992".</PARA>
<PARA>Having just heard what Senator Parer said, I think it may be obvious in one sense why I seek that amendment. I am not here to make life easy for either the Opposition or the Government. I honestly and openly state at the outset that I believe sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act should be repealed. Indeed, this morning I gave notice of my intention to introduce a private member's Bill to that effect in the next week of sitting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not by any means alone in that view. The Australian Labor Party and the ACTU have such a policy, as has the Australian Democrats. In 1984, as Senator Parer has said, the ALP in government sought to repeal sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act. I can do little better than quote Senator Button&mdash;today is probably an appropriate day to do that&mdash;who is now the Leader of the Government, from the debate on 5 October 1984 in which he made several very interesting points. Senator Button said on that occasion that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the section was so widely drawn that its main operation is in respect of industrial action which often has little, if any, effect on competition.</PARA>
<PARA>He further stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it has become more a weapon directed at the industrial relations activities of trade unions under the guise of competition policy.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Fraser Government amended Section 45D in 1978 and 1980 to broaden its application against union activities. In addition, during 1980, Section 45E was introduced into the Trade Practices Act. Section 45D commonly operates to prohibit boycott situations arising from a refusal by employees to handle goods intended for a third party for the purpose of pressuring the third party to accede to certain demands.</PARA>
<PARA>Unlike the impression that Senator Parer has given, and may have wanted to give, these sections do not just operate against unions, they operate against persons&mdash;individuals&mdash;as well. We should bear that in mind in this debate.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Button also said in that debate in October 1984:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is concerned about the possible effect of the remedies of penalties and damages which are available under the Trade Practices Act for contraventions of Sections 45D and 45E. These are potentially highly disruptive to Australia's industrial relations. Their application, where boycotts occur, is unlikely to lead to the effective or satisfactory resolution of the dispute.</PARA>
<PARA>This question, of course, is one that arises in the terms of reference put forward in Senator Bell's motion.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Button went on to note that practical experience had, even up until that time, shown that the remedies provided under the Trade Practices Act had not been effective in the way which is often claimed. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . when the evidence is examined, there is not much reason to conclude that the injunctive process has been particularly speedy or that using this legal remedy will help to resolve a dispute. In some cases, the issuing of an injunction under the Act has even led to a worsening of the dispute.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Button also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have argued to this stage that action under the Trade Practices Act in respect of secondary boycott disputes is neither the most appropriate course for resolution of the dispute nor necessarily a particularly quick or effective course of action.</PARA>
<PARA>So the debate went on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the same debate, possibly to the delight of those Opposition members present, I will also quote from the then Democrat spokesperson, Senator Jack Evans. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government should have a clear and concise message from the Australian Democrats. The repeal of sections 45D and 45E is not on as long as the Australian Democrats have the balance of power in this Parliament. . . </PARA>
<PARA>I regret to say that quite possibly the situation may be no different now from what it was when Senator Evans made that statement, in spite of the fact that since that time, and because of the work of many people within the Australian Democrats, myself included, there has been a change in the Democrat Party policy. That change occurred via ballot in the second half of 1991. The policy, republished in February 1992, reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Item 1: Support the repeal of Sections 45D and E of the Trade Practices Act.</PARA>
<PARA>On 31 July this year I resigned from the Australian Democrats and, to that point, no action on 45D and E had been taken by the Democrats.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did set myself an agenda for parliamentary work as an independent and sections 45D and E repeal was high on that agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 4 September I announced at a public sector seminar at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology my intention to give priority to drafting the introduction of a private member's Bill to repeal sections 45D and E during the October or November sittings of the Senate. I have had discussions with people in the Labor movement and begun preparation of that Bill. Knowing that the Democrat policy was in place, and with the ALP and the ACTU also having longstanding policies, I did believe that this initiative would get the issue off the backburner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have felt particularly strongly the need for action in this area as we have come closer in this country, and very much closer in my own State, to facing the New Zealand experience, one that we will probably face also federally.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In taking this action I think it is important to stress that I believe the Australian working people will need every possible avenue that is open to them to protect their hard-won rights and protections as they move into the coalition's industrial relations wasteland, State by State and, as I said, probably, after the next election, federally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here I want to note that I lay it at the feet of the ALP in government that we face the possibility of a federal coalition government. The ALP in government has caved in to economic rationalism&mdash;to corporate government, with corporate unions and corporate business. It has brought us the recession and agonisingly high levels of unemployment and consequent justified anger in the community&mdash;anger which was vented in the Victorian State election a week and a half ago. There is no guarantee at all, despite obvious wishful thinking within Government, that such anger will not also be vented at the next federal election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scenario is that we may be given a coalition government by virtue of the ALP's failure to act as a Labor government in the truest sense. The least that this Labor Government could do is give the Labor movement what it promised, as Senator Parer outlined, back in 1984&mdash;repeal of sections 45D and E. Goodness knows, the Labor movement has had very little out of this Labor Government.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Working Australians, as I said, need the best armoury they can have in preparation for the industrial relations wasteland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would add that I think not to do this on behalf of the ALP in government could possibly ensure that the ALP does lose the next election. I do not see how the Labor Party could expect working Australians to rally round in quite the way that they need to, to support the re-election of a Labor government in these circumstances. They will not stand by and meekly watch the ALP, with the Democrats, bury sections 45D and E repeal in a Senate committee to a date which goes beyond when we all know the next federal election will be. As for the ACTU, it has an obligation to put pressure on its Labor government to implement the policy of its rank and file, and not to just operate as a corporate executive in collusion with corporate government and corporate business. I do not believe that that executive rule will be tolerated by the union membership in these circumstances, and anger will be vented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, for those who are concerned about environmental policy, repeal of sections 45D and E of the Trade Practices Act also has a much greater sense of urgency and necessity as we move on towards the next election. There is some irony, I think, that the proposed burial of repeal, which I believe Senator Bell's motion in its present form represents, should be being debated in this chamber today, on the very day when the Democrats have effectively and justifiably sought to put a spotlight on the shortcomings of this Government in terms of its environmental promises at the 1990 election.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have expected that those issues which are important to the environmental movement would have had higher priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondary boycotts can often be the only weapon that is available to protect the environment from unsustainable exploitation. I can hear now the bulldozers in the forests; I can see the sands being dug up; and I can see the endangered species disappearing before the onslaught of the ultimate economic rationalists who will make the Labor Party in government look like a bunch of pussycats. Unless this legislation is repealed, environmentalists&mdash;community people&mdash;will agonise over the question. I remind the Labor Party, the Opposition and, indeed, the Democrats, that when people have been polled on their issues of major concern, issues of the environment remain the highest priority as long term issues. People's memories do not fade and their concerns do not go away when it comes to the long term survival of the planet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondary boycotts can be used to stop uranium exports, or to halt the importation of rainforest timber. They can also be used in the fight against environmentally damaging developments at local level by the people who are excluded from this sort of process. Not the unions, necessarily, I  tell Senator Parer, but real people at their local level fighting for the future of the planet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight's debate and ultimate vote is not the end of this issue in the life of this Parliament. Though it is obvious that both the ALP Government and the Democrats will combine to ensure an end to this particular debate&mdash;in spite of the policies of their memberships&mdash;they are really saying, `We have a policy to repeal sections 45D and 45E but we want to spend the next seven months considering the whole issue'. By then, the next election will be over and it will be too late to act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party and the Democrats can give the lie to my view only by supporting my amendment to bring forth the reporting date to the end of November, a quick reference&mdash;and we all know that Senate committees are very good at quick references; we do them weekly&mdash;and one which would enable legislation implementing the policies of both those parties to be before this place and to be carried on the basis of the policies of those parties before we face the next election. As I said, I gave notice today of a Bill to effect repeal of sections 45D and 45E. The debate is alive and it will persist. In an ultimate vote on an unamended motion, I will oddly enough be voting with the Opposition in opposition to this motion, but for very different reasons, because I do not wish to officiate at the burial of all hope of repeal of sections 45D and 45E in the life of this Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague Senator Knowles says, that support is dropping. Senator Knowles has probably been focusing on the figures in Western Australia which show an even worse trend than the overall national figures. If we ask ourselves why this fall in support has occurred&mdash;and it has occurred during the time that Senator Powell was Leader of the Australian Democrats, and now Senator Coulter is Leader&mdash;I suspect one of the reasons is that the former leadership of Don Chipp and then Senator Haines was not only more in touch with the views of their own supporters but also with the views of the Australian community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The former leaders of the Australian Democrats&mdash;as mentioned by my colleague Senator Parer&mdash;were vehement supporters of sections 45D and 45E. In 1984, and again in 1987 before the election, the Labor Government attempted to repeal sections 45D and 45E. Make no mistake&mdash;I say this for those people who are listening to the debate this evening&mdash;these sections remain in the Trade Practices Act because of the Australian Democrats' support for the views of the Liberal National Parties that it was vital to retain those sections, in the legal arrangements governing the behaviour of trade unions, in an attempt to bring some order and some fairness and equity into the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Don Chipp perhaps reflected the older style approach of the Australian Democrats and the role they should play, which is in complete contrast to the current role that Senator Coulter and Senator Bell apparently see. I ask honourable senators to contrast this thought and the views of Don Chipp in 1983, as the Leader of the Australian Democrats, with the views we have heard this evening from Senator Bell and a former Leader, Senator Powell:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Labor Party and the trade union movement are by definition, inseparable. With these intractable vested interests, there's no way either of these parties can `bring Australia together' . . .</PARA>
<PARA>How right was Don Chipp, as time has shown. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . would you feel contented to have that power transferred to Bob Hawke, knowing the extravagances of the trade union movement could be ruthlessly impacted on him?</PARA>
<PARA>We have seen, in the relentless changes which have been made to industrial law during the period of the Hawke-Keating Government, a deliberate attempt to entrench the power and privilege of the trade union leadership&mdash;often at the expense of their members&mdash;in the law of this country. But until now they have not had the support in the Senate to remove sections 45D and 45E. We can recall that, under Senator Powell's leadership, Senator McLean went out of his way to establish very close links&mdash;in contrast to the previous policy of Senator Powell's Party and under her leadership&mdash;with the trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 15 March 1991, a little over a year and a half ago, Senator McLean paid a much publicised visit to the ACTU. Senator McLean of the Australian Democrats said he would brief the executive on the Democrat's industrial relations policy and review legislation likely to come before the Parliament in the next two sessions. He indicated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The appearance will cap off a strengthening of relations between the two which began after the ACTU Secretary, Mr Bill Kelty, and the President, Mr Martin Ferguson, took office.</PARA>
<PARA>That was a very important meeting, a quite historic meeting&mdash;historic in the sense that it perhaps symbolised more than others the complete about-turn in policy that the Australian Democrats had taken in relation to the trade union movement and the appropriate role of the law in governing the relations with trade unions. I suggest to Senator Powell that history will show that this was one of her fundamental mistakes. Another was her strong support for the ban on political advertising. The strong support she gave to that ban which served to inhibit the right of free speech is probably one of the reasons why, in the end, her colleagues did not wish to retain her as Leader of the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I suggest that another fundamental mistake made by the Democrats under Senator Powell's leadership was their unthinking support for former Senator McLean's approach to remove sections 45D and 45E from the Trade Practices Act, which was out of touch not only with community thinking but also, as all the polls showed, with those people who in the previous election had supported the Australian Democrats. One of the opinion polls that was taken showed that some 70 per cent of Australian Democrat voters thought that governments should introduce stricter laws to regulate trade unions. But, under Senator Powell's leadership, her party ignored the wishes of Democrat voters and it encouraged Senator McLean to cosy up to the trade union movement. That is one of the reasons why some sections of small business that used to support her party, and which former Senator Chipp went out of his way to cultivate, decided that they would have no more to do with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that Senator Powell and Senator Bell ask themselves: who in the community demands the repeal of sections 45D and 45E? There is no up-swell of fury in the community about the use of 45D and 45E.

I suggest to Senator Powell that her support for increased trade union power&mdash;along with her support for banning political advertising&mdash;is one of the reasons she is no longer the Leader of the Australian Democrats.</PARA></TALK.START>

I have always listened very carefully to what Senator Bell has had to say about the IR area to see whether he had the courage to return the Australian Democrats to their traditional base.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, I put it to you that Senator Bell and his party will pay a further price for threatening the rights of small business and for threatening the rights of ordinary workers who, above all, are the ones who suffer most from capricious trade union action. Senator Bell worries about secondary boycotts legislation in terms of the right to strike. It is interesting, and I think fair to say, that in his remarks he did not seem to worry about people and families who lost their income as a result of a strike in a plant unconnected with the work in their own plant; and he did not worry about the massive disruption which a strike in a certain key area could cause people in the wider community. He did not worry about those rights at all. </PARA>

We can now see where these people&mdash;the Australian Democrats, Senator Powell and the Independents&mdash;now stand on this issue, which I believe will be an important one in the next Federal election. If by some great mischance or misfortune the Keating Government were returned to office, there is no doubt that the removal of sections 45D and 45E would occur and that the trade union bosses, the Bill Keltys and Martin Fergusons of this world&mdash;who have never stood for office but still wish to run this country&mdash;would find themselves in possession of greatly enhanced power.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak in support of my colleagues in the debate on this motion and to make some comments of my own. I begin by dealing with the comments of Senator Chamarette. The first question I would like to ask her is who wrote her notes. She read them very assiduously. She did not know what she was talking about and she got herself in one hell of a muddle in the process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chamarette made some comments about environmental matters and environmental concerns. I thought I might just make one comment about that, although I do not see the relevance to this debate, in terms of the coalition's position on environmental matters. I would like to inform her, as I have informed other people in this chamber before, that in terms of practical environmental action the coalition believes in positive action. What are now known as soil conservation districts or Landcare districts were established in Western Australia after changes to the Western Australia Soil Conservation Act following a meeting between myself and the honourable Dick Old, who was the conservative Minister for Agriculture at that particular time. That model operates right across Australia. So Senator Chamarette can say what she likes about environmental concerns, and who cares&mdash;but that is fact, it is on the public record and I think she should know about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I think the tragedy of this reference is that, once again, we see an endeavour to link an industrial matter with what is essentially a restriction of trade matter. I doubt whether anybody on the other side of the chamber, the Democrats or the Independents, has actually read what the Trade Practices Act says. Section 45D of the Trade Practices Act states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subject to this section, a person shall not, in concert with a second person, engage in conduct that hinders or prevents the supply of goods or services by a third person to a fourth person (not being an employer of the first-mentioned person). . .</PARA>
<PARA>Et cetera. For whatever reason, a number of people quite incorrectly have pulled this in and tried to make out that it is an industrial issue. It is not. It is a matter of movements of goods and services in the strictest sense of trade. Section 45E, which is also very important, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subject to this section, a person who has been accustomed, or is under an obligation, to supply goods or services to, or to acquire goods or services from, a second person shall not make a contract or arrangement, or arrive at an understanding, with a third person (being an organization of employees, an officer of such an organization, or another person acting for or on behalf of such an organization or officer) if the proposed contract, arrangement or understanding contains a provision that. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Et cetera. It then goes on to outline what it is about. It is about the restriction of or the interference in the movement of goods and services. That is what the Trade Practices Act is about; it is what sections 45D and 45E are about. The fact that it has been abused in an industrial sense by a number of persons, a number of employers and a number of unions does not alter the fact that sections 45D and 45E are about the freedom of movement of goods and services within Australia and across its shores either by aircraft or by sea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This part of the Trade Practices Act has been a very effective and cheap mechanism whereby in many cases, and I will touch on a couple of them in a moment or two, serious damage that could have been done to a particular business or persons&mdash;that is, a group of people or an individual&mdash;or to our position as a trading nation has been prevented. That is what section 45D and section 45E are about. This matter should not be confused with an industrial matter, although this motion does exactly that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not going to cover all the points that my colleagues made in relation to the particular aspects of this motion, but some are worth re-emphasising.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main part of the motion before us is cut up into parts (a), (b) and (c). Firstly, in my time in this Parliament, which has been just over two years, this is the first time, certainly on a committee on which I have served, that a reference from a committee member has not been brought to the committee before it came to this chamber for some discussion. From that point of view, I say to Senator Bell that I am very disappointed and alarmed about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Had this reference come before the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, there could have been an opportunity to clarify it, make it better or amend it with the wisdom of all Committee members around. I do not know whether with other committees it is the practice that notices of motion in terms of references to committees go to the committees concerned or come to this place. Obviously, there is no reason why they cannot come here directly. As a matter of practice, one would get better resolutions before the Senate if the committee had the opportunity to examine them in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first part of the motion, which is broken into parts (a), (b), and (c), goes straight to the point of section 45D and section 45E of the Trade Practices Act 1974. It then goes on to talk about industrial relations in Australia. As I have already said, section 45D and section 45E are about restrictions of trade. In my view, if this motion is passed and amended by Senator Powell's amendment or Senator Cooney's amendment, I am quite prepared to look at the various aspects of it. As I said, this issue is about trade; it should not be confused with industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part (a), which tries to tie section 45D and section 45E to the High Court decision with regard to free speech, is the most extraordinary part of the motion. I cannot in my wildest dreams ascertain how one can relate the restriction of the movement of goods and services to the right of an individual to free speech. In fact, if the two were to be tied together, I would have thought that the right to freedom of movement of those goods and services would go closer to free speech than what is suggested in part (a) of this motion, where it talks about section 45D and section 45E being unduly harsh and restrictive when compared with the International Labour Organisation conventions on freedom of association. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cooney also mentioned ILO conventions and where I stood in terms of Australia's signatory to those. While Australia remains a signatory to a particular convention, I believe that we should respect that signature. I also give notice that that does not stop Australia, as a nation, examining some of these conventions and treaties that we have signed over the years. I do not believe at this time that some of those are in the best interests of Australia for a variety of reasons, which I will not go into tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part (b) of the motion, which clarifies a worker's right to withdraw labour and states under what conditions such withdrawal may or may not be pursued, raises a very interesting point. That is what section 45D and section 45E of the Trade Practices Act in one sense, although it is a trade matter, are all about; that is, it is the right of an individual to trade his goods or services without interference by other people, particularly those who exist outside a direct relationship with the people doing the trading. I believe that section 45D and section 45E have clarified this position very succinctly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I relate to what was part of the embryo of section 45D and section 45E. I am not going to claim here that it was the sole issue, because I know it was not, but it was very important in terms of the necessity for section 45D and section 45E to be placed in the Trade Practices Act. There was no section 45D and section 45E in the Trade Practices Act in 1974 for protection against people who interfered, be it individually, collectively or otherwise and from whatever spectrum, with the movement of goods and services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time, the Western Australian Farmers Federation, which was then known as the Farmers Union&mdash;I was a member of the executive&mdash;decided to take legal action against the bans that were applied to the movement of wheat in Chilean and Indonesian flagships. Our only effective recourse in law to the bans that were placed on that, which put at risk a very significant amount of Western Australian wheat trade, not to mention wheat from other States, was the Crimes Act. We were successful in using the Crimes Act in that case to have those bans lifted from those ships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were a number of problems with using the Crimes Act. The two principal ones were that, firstly, one had to go through the process of proving prima facie evidence, which meant it was then handed over to the State to run one's particular case. It was slow, cumbersome and expensive. The other thing which I did not like about being forced to use the Crimes Act was that one of the penalties involved with it was a mandatory gaol sentence. I emphasise that point. Either section 30 or section 31 was the part of the Crimes Act which dealt with restrictions on trade. Even though at that time I and other members of the executive that I served on were determined to go through with that measure, we did not sit comfortably with the fact that the people involved in creating the bans on the loading of those ships could end up in gaol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When sections 45D and 45E were introduced not only were the injunctive powers much quicker but also they were much cheaper, and the penalties&mdash;this may not be exactly the correct way to put it&mdash;far more befitted the crime than what existed and still exists in the Crimes Act today. That is part of the reason that section 45D came into being. Paragraph (c) of the terms of reference states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">whether sections 45D and 45E now provide adequate protection against secondary boycotts, in particular for small businesses, and the alternative means to provide such protection.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very interesting clause because one would have thought that if the Democrats, through Senator Robert Bell, thought that they had a better way of overcoming the alleged problems that sections 45D and 45E have in terms of restrictions on trade in Australia, they would have put it on the table. It is not on the table. I believe that this is a political manoeuvre to try to create a situation which might well occur where they think they can pick up a few disenchanted Labor Party votes in the lead-up to the next election. I think that is what the ploy of this little exercise is about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn further to what is in the terms of reference and another reason why I could not support them. I am talking about the reference to the Industrial Relations Act 1988. In the 2 1/2 years that I have been here I have sat on a number of committees. In a vast majority of cases it was expected that the terms of reference be precise and be designed to look at a particular aspect of a problem, deal with that and then get on with the next aspect of the terms of reference relating to that particular inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paragraph (b) mentions the Industrial Relations Act 1988. I seriously ask the Democrats, the Independents and the Government whether they are really serious about us conducting an inquiry with the scope which exists in the Industrial Relations Act 1988. Are they suggesting that we look into certified agreements? Are they suggesting that we look into the contractors legislation? Are they suggesting that we look into all aspects of industrial relations law which exists in Australia at this time? I would suggest that these terms of reference say precisely that. That is what I interpret them to say, although there is an emphasis on sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we start looking at how broad and how wide the International Labour Organisation conventions that Australia is a signatory to are I would have thought it would be far better if we were going to look at a particular concern of sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act that we should be looking at the Trade Practices Act. Sections 45D and 45E are about restrictions of trade and the movement of goods and services. It is spelt out very clearly in the Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of other points that I would like to make about this particular reference relating to things that have been said here tonight. I particularly refer to Senator Powell's remarks about having the Committee report by the end of November or thereabouts. Senator Powell may have changed her stripes as far as being a Democrat is concerned but she has not changed her stripes as far as using the guillotine is concerned. If we are going to have an inquiry into this matter and look at some of the things that I have mentioned in terms of the width and breadth of it, it is absolutely ludicrous to suggest that the Committee could report in any comprehensive or responsible manner between now and the end of November. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also interesting to note that the repeal of sections 45D and 45E is the policy of the ACTU, the policy of the Government and the policy of the Democrats. Senator Powell made reference to Senator Button and made it quite clear that her position was for repeal of section 45D and 45E as was that of Senator Chamarette. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this reference were to go to the Committee&mdash;despite what Senator Cooney said about giving it a fair and equitable hearing, we already have a policy position adopted by all the main players in the game&mdash;there is no way that it would get a fair and equitable hearing and come to a just conclusion. For those and other reasons, I nor my colleagues can support this particular reference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to close with some brief comments relating to the application of sections 45D and 45E and the number of situations which have been brought to a head or short-circuited because of sections 45D and 45E. It has not so much related to the use of sections 45D and 45E in the strict legal sense. I can relate to both sides of the equation, not just employees but also employers. There are a number of famous cases where employers colluded with individuals and unions to place a boycott on the movement of goods and services. Once two or three cases had gone through the law courts all it took was a phone call to say to the individuals involved, whether it be the employee, the employer, the union or the organisation, `If you don't restrain yourself from that particular activity we will have no option but to take action under sections 45D or 45E of the Trade Practices Act'. For that reason, if for no other, it has been a very effective measure to stop the interference with the movement of goods and services in this country and it has also been very cheap. It has not run into the thousands of dollars that has been spent on legal fees when dealing with particular interferences in goods and services and other legal cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have touched on a number of things relating to this reference before us tonight. The two most compelling reasons why this reference should not go ahead are, firstly, it is not confined to dealing with the alleged problems which exist in the movement of goods and services under the Trade Practices Act. It totally opens up the Industrial Relations Act 1988. Secondly, the situation which exists in terms of the people who will be sitting down in judgment, as Senator Powell has already explained to us, all have very strong strict policy positions and it would require a decision of their parties or the Australian Council of Trade Unions to change their position and we all know that that is not going to happen. </PARA>

Senator Parer quoted former Senator Jack Evans as saying that these sections were about protecting the interests of small business people. Senator Parer then quoted former Senator Siddons as saying that the Government had been unable to give the Australian Democrats sufficient guarantees for the protection of small business and innocent third parties and that, therefore, the Australian Democrats at that time had not been supportive of moves to repeal the two sections. </PARA>

In that period of time&mdash;and the results are irrefutable&mdash;we have developed a consultative and cooperative attitude towards workplace negotiation rather than the confrontationalist attitude that is inherent in the adversarial injunctive method summarised and exemplified by sections 45D and 45E. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That development begs the question whether these sections are suitable now. That is the question being asked by this motion. No answer is proposed by me or its supporters either by implication or directly. However, the question is asked whether these sections are adequate now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Powell suggested a couple of times that this motion served the function of burying the repeal of sections 45D and 45E in a committee. I suggest that is not so. I made it clear in my earlier remarks that those affected by this matter can hardly afford to ignore their considerable responsibility to fully present their case to the Committee. That is a responsibility which all parties affected by this legislation must recognise. It is a nonsense to suggest that they would shy away from putting that case. That case is public property and is in the forum of the election debate that will surely occur. That election debate will be running at the precise time that these positions will be being fully presented and, I suggest, will be anything but buried. I suggest that in fact it will be exposed to the fullest extent. To ignore the opportunity to expose this argument to the fullest extent possible will be at the peril of those groups, individuals and bodies that are at all affected by this issue. This Committee will be a vehicle for providing that opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The information gleaned by this committee process will be available and there for all to see. The recommendations of the Committee will be there for all to see and available to whichever party claims government after June 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next contribution came from Senator Kemp, who spent a good deal of time making sure that we understood some latest poll results. I say in passing that I can readily demonstrate that this action which I am taking&mdash;it has come to fruition today&mdash;is not motivated by any attention I have paid to polling. I have a thoroughly cynical attitude to polling. That is because the poll immediately prior to my election predicted that I would receive about one-seventh of the primary votes that I actually received. If at the next election I receive a similar increment over the present poll in Tasmania, I could bring in more Australian Democrat senators than there would ever be of Labor and Liberal senators from Tasmania combined. I recognise the ridiculousness of such a position. Senator Watson is alarmed by it&mdash;and so am I. I am therefore most cynical of polling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kemp knows little about the exigencies of Tasmanian voting habits. I recognise and respect the balloted and established policy of our Party, and that is what I am required to put forward. We in our Party do not have the option of hopping around in response to an opinion poll or the hottest pressure group of the month. As honourable senators have been reminded several times during this debate, Democrat policy is clear on this matter and it is that which has motivated this matter being brought to a head. As a matter of fact, it was before Christmas 1991 that we were first attracted to the prospect of being able to do something about section 45D. It was in fact a part of the proposed industrial relations amendment package which was being negotiated at that time. At that moment I thought that there may have been offered by the Government a path of dealing more sensibly with these aspects of the legislation. That package was withdrawn&mdash;not followed through&mdash;by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the interim we have seen some other amendments to the Industrial Relations Act. We have seen the successful introduction of those amendments without the doom and gloom which had been predicted by pressure groups at the time. Subsequently, I know&mdash;and Senator Watson may also know this&mdash;that recent figures on the building approvals that have been passed in southern Tasmania at least have shown a remarkable improvement over the previous month. I think the increase is of the order of 7 per cent. That is a trend which is also reflected in the ACT where there has been somewhat of a boom in housing over the past few months. That is in contradiction of the predictions of those who lobbied against the Industrial Relations Act. That is by the by. We have these dire predictions after the passage of some legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have reached the stage where we could see that the Government was not proposing any other additional amendments to industrial relations legislation. We could also see the opportunity for any examination of this slipping past, thus reducing the opportunity for reference or even consideration of this aspect of our industrial relations practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his contribution to the debate, Senator Cooney demonstrated the reasonableness of this inquiry and suggested, lo and behold, that the inquiry would elicit facts. That is a matter which seemed to escape previous contributors to the debate. Senator Cooney then went on to consider reasons why the coalition might not want to expose its policy on this matter to a committee of inquiry. He searched for reasons why the coalition might not want to refer the matter for impartial inquiry. He searched but could not find any reasons for that refusal. In fact, we have had some reasons promoted by the coalition, but I suggest that they do not stand up to scrutiny. I suggest that the reasons are hollow because the inquiry simply seeks to establish facts, as Senator Cooney suggested, which can lead to a balanced consideration of this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chamarette contributed a few words in support of the amendment by Senator Powell to introduce a reporting date in November. I was not convinced. In fact, Senator Chamarette did not mention in her contribution&mdash;perhaps she was not required to mention it, but I thought it would have come into the discussion at some stage&mdash;the actual work of the Committee. I may be criticised for referring this matter to this Committee, but search as I might, I could not find the opportunity for other committees to take on this matter, or its relevance to any other committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are told in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> that the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training is involved in at least two inquiries at the moment: one into the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Act and another into the implications of sustained high levels of unemployment among young people. Both seem to me to have some degree of importance and should not be overshadowed by a quick, slick inquiry which could only be superficial in the time allowed. Also, they could impinge on that inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps I could have suggested and even made a case to refer the matter to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs chaired by Senator Cooney, as he is such a reasonable sort of fellow. We are told again in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> that the five inquiries being run concurrently by that Committee are perhaps just a little overwhelming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also remind honourable senators that at the moment the Senate has some 115 Bills remaining for consideration in the 20 sitting days until Christmas. In the time since the Senate was presented with the list of 132 Bills in early September, we have managed to pass 17. I was never confident of a reporting date which required any degree of haste from honourable senators in their consideration. I use the words of another honourable senator who contributed to the debate when I say that haste would remove the opportunity to provide a comprehensive and responsible reaction to this reference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I usually listen carefully to and am entertained by what Senator Crane says. Senator Crane was meticulous in his presentation. He said that sections 45D and 45E were about freedom of movement of goods and services and thus belonged within the Trade Practices Act. I do not dispute that that is Senator Crane's opinion. There are perhaps thousands of Australians who consider that is not correct, but that is not what I would contend now, either for or against. I think what we are talking about is the time to clarify the correct home of this particular aspect of industrial relations practice. What I was interested in and what I did find entertaining was that Senator Crane reminded us that this particular section had been abused by employers and employees alike. I am indebted to Senator Crane for reminding us of that. That is how I understood his contribution and it confirms my contention that it is time to re-examine sections 45D and 45E in terms of their relevance, applicability and success in doing what they claim to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were also given the benefit of Senator Crane's wildest dreams. I wonder about the relevance of those in this place, but in those wildest dreams, Senator Crane was struggling to find a relevance for part of my motion. I suggest that the inquiry could probably benefit from the content of those wildest dreams, but they are not particularly relevant to proving that sections 45D and 45E should not be examined. In fact, Senator Crane was already exercising his brain about what the Committee could do with its inquiry&mdash;how wide it could be and how much time it would need to produce that comprehensive and responsible report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate also heard Senator Cooney foreshadow an amendment to be proposed on behalf of the Government and relating to whether these sections are a satisfactory means of preventing and settling industrial disputes. The word `preventing' is significant in that additional clause. It seems to me entirely appropriate that in keeping with the notion that we now have a much more cooperative, consultative attitude to industrial relations practice, rather than a confrontationist attitude, we should seek to find out whether these particular sections contribute to the prevention of industrial disputes. For that reason alone I think that this additional clause is admissible. Of course there are other questions that can be asked from that clause. Whether the sections are satisfactory is a matter of quite some content in the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is with those thoughts, and with thanks to the contributors to the debate, that I conclude. I commend my motion to the chamber. The Democrats will support the amendment foreshadowed by Senator Cooney, but not the amendment moved by Senator Powell. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I refer to the amendment moved by Senator Powell, and indicate that the Liberal-National Party Opposition will not be supporting this amendment on the grounds that if the hearing goes ahead&mdash;which it appears it will in some shape or form&mdash;it will be like hitting a hornet's nest. Our belief is that sections 45D and E have not been major issues except in the minds of a handful of militant trade unions which have an unlimited lust for power. It has not been a major issue because it has acted as a deterrent and has been used very rarely, something which is not understood, apparently, by Senator Chamarette, Senator Powell or the Democrats.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it does go ahead, it will need time to be seriously considered. Bringing it forward, with that limited time span, is tantamount to a guillotine on those who would give contrary evidence. It is a gag on expressions of contrary opinion. I suppose that is not surprising, in view of the attitude taken by Senator Powell when she was Leader of the Democrats in supporting the broader ad ban Bill, which would have banned all advertising for political purposes on radio and television for 365 days of the year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the amendment foreshadowed by Senator Cooney, on the face of it, it has some merit, but the Liberal-National parties will be opposing it simply because we oppose the reference to the committee itself. It is all very well for Senator Bell and Senator Cooney to say this would be an impartial committee and there would be an impartial inquiry. I can see by the grin on Senator Bell's face that even he does not believe that. I think most of us in this place have sat on committees long enough to know that a matter such as this will inevitably be predetermined by the Labor majority who have no option but to support the items moved in the motion by Senator Bell. To do otherwise, by any Labor senator in this place, would be tantamount to political suicide. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators will recall that some four months ago, when we were discussing the Development Allowance Authority Bill, I raised in this chamber the fact that some of the measures before us then had been designed to lead Australia out of recession but time and time again the proposals were too narrow and too restrictive&mdash;and I referred in particular to the infrastructure proposals and the lack of use of limited partnerships in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) which was being discussed at that time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But tonight I rise to comment on the Bill before us, the Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill, which certainly acknowledges some of the limitations that we drew attention to some four months ago. The Government states that the primary purpose of the Bill is to increase the flexibility of the principal Act, otherwise known as the Development Authority Allowance Act, so that a more consistent approach is available for the various types of prospective applicants for the development allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Development Allowance Authority was announced as one of the measures of the One Nation statement and was established as recently as May of this year to assess the eligibility of large projects for the development allowance. Since then, according to the Government, it has become clear that amendments are desirable. Consequently, this Bill will allow for applicants for the development allowance to elect to aggregate two or more joint venture projects or specified projects and bring expenditure incurred in the long term lease of certain new units of a plan within the ambit of the original legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the original legislation was introduced into the Parliament three months ago, I indicated that there were certain problems associated with the set of criteria determining which were the companies which could avail themselves of this deduction&mdash;a deduction which is equal to 10 per cent of the eligible plant expenditure in the first year that plant is installed ready for use. I noticed specifically that the Government's proposed development allowance could discriminate against small projects, that is projects with a capital cost of less than $50m. I stated that this $50m threshold was arbitrary and distorting and encouraged vertical integration which may or may not have been the most efficient production structure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With pleasure, I note that the amendments proposed by this Bill to the original Development Allowance Authority Act include some of the changes I noted that were then necessary. Two new types of schemes are introduced with this legislation. They are described as an `individual pilot scheme' and a `joint venture project scheme'. These schemes will allow projects involving new productive facilities to be added to projects which expand existing productive facilities and, therefore, will qualify for the allowance by meeting the $50m threshold test. Further flexibility in meeting the $50m threshold can be obtained by combining purchases and leased assets in a project. A mechanism is also introduced whereby a lessor can claim the development allowance benefit by way of a pre-qualifying certificate that has been issued by the Development Allowance Authority to the lessee. There is also now going to be a new vertical integration test and a number of other consequential amendments to the original legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, the amendments contained in this Bill will allow the aggregation of new productive facilities with other projects consisting of the expansion, upgrading or improvement of existing facilities where the new and existing productive facilities are vertically integrated. At the time of the introduction of the original legislation, I further stated that this development allowance was nothing more than a band-aid solution which would only provide a small drop in the ocean of reforms that were needed to put this country back on its feet. This allowance is only expected to provide $40m in 1993-94 and $70m in 1995-96&mdash;a rather modest allowance. For example, Mr Colin Myers, a spokesman from MIM Ltd, one of Queensland's largest companies, said that it was not the sort of benefit that would make the difference between projects commencing or not. The very modest benefit that such an allowance would provide to industry must be contrasted with the coalition's Fightback program which provides $20 billion in tax relief for business; this $20 billion would encourage investment and create real jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As this chamber has heard time and time again, this country does need major tax reforms if it is to become a viable economic nation once again. If this Government were serious about investment in Australia, it would abolish payroll tax, wholesale sales tax, fuel excise tax and cut personal income tax. However, though I welcome the amendments, the proposals are still too restrictive, in particular the $50m threshold. This threshold will deliberately cut out highly efficient and productive capital projects which just happen to fall below the $50m threshold. Therefore, although these amendments will make the development allowance more attractive, the coalition will continue to doubt the benefit of this Bill and the concept that it espouses for the same fundamental reasons it had when it opposed the original legislation. Not only does it discriminate against projects with a capital cost of less than $50m, it also does not make it available for investment in plant and equipment in all the areas of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The original legislation specifically excluded projects from the following areas: retailing, wholesaling, office accommodation, non-tourist accommodation, business or financial services, residential real estate, and print or electronic media. The legislation is specifically confined to factories, mines, quarrying, wharves and other port facilities, hotels, pipelines, and transport facilities. Further, a test of absence of structural assistance or protection is also applied so as to exclude projects predominantly in textile, clothing and footwear; passenger motor vehicle or parts; dairy products; tobacco; and raw and refining sugar industries. The exclusion in the latter does not apply where the Development Allowance Authority is satisfied that the projects will receive industry specific assistance of 10 per cent or less. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another one of the arbitrary qualifying criteria is that projects must meet the competitiveness test. Included in this test is the provision that the projects must espouse industrial relations agreements or arrangements which promote the achievement of world best practice as well as projects themselves needing to be the `world best' in economic terms and efficiency. How the Government intends to determine this `world best' criteria I believe is difficult to understand as the criteria for the competitiveness test are given scant attention in the explanatory memorandum in the original legislation, although they are mentioned in clauses of the legislation. This suggests that the Government could be giving scant attention to these criteria when it comes to interpreting the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question that arises is with regard to the phrase `world best practice'. What is the sense behind setting up a scheme of special assistance when the recipients are firms that already are identified as having little or existing assistance but have in place world best management and industrial relations arrangements? Obviously, if firms have world best arrangements in place, they would not require any additional assistance from taxpayers to compete in the international marketplace. However, this competitiveness test will not apply to projects commenced prior to 31 December. This calls into question just how serious the Government is about applying the competitiveness test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As my colleague in the other place Mr Bruce Scott, the honourable member for Maranoa, has pointed out, this waiving of the competitiveness test has raised serious contentions within industry. For example, Mr Peter Wade, the Director of North Broken Hill Peko, has argued that this exemption has defeated the whole purpose of the legislation. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why should we have one set of rules for a project which starts this year and another for the next?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Wade said that world best industrial practice in the mining industry may be to have no union rather than single union coverage, as is proposed by the Government's guidelines for the allowance. </PARA>
<PARA>He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not mean to be facetious about it but it is almost an impossible series of situations to measure up to.</PARA>
<PARA>These comments come from one of the nation's major investors. This company wants to invest in this nation, but to do so it requires, as do all other business leaders in this country, long term, reliable policies, and not ad hoc, one-off government proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Development Allowance Authority Act and the amendments proposed by this Bill before us tonight are a deliberate attempt by this Government to pick the winners and give selective industry assistance. In this instance the Government seems to have completely ignored the Industry Commission's detailed criticism of selective industry assistance which it made in its 1989-90 annual report. There is a chapter in that report entitled `Strategic Trade Theory and the East Asian Experience' which demonstrates exactly why the approach taken by this original legislation is precisely the wrong approach. The Industry Commission concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Economic success in Japan and the dynamic Asian economies cannot be closely associated with strategic Government intervention. . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Industry specific assistance far from being a prerequisite for success is likely to be harmful especially if it is extensive and maintained over long periods.</PARA>
<PARA>The way ahead for Australia is not down the path of selective industry assistance. The way ahead lies in relieving industry, and Australians more generally, of the burden of government and its operations at all levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should not be within the capacity of government to identify investments, businesses or industries that are likely to be successful in the future. The taxpayer should not be paying for failed businesses. The responsibility for this lies with the shareholders because they can make the decision whether or not to invest and will either reap the rewards or suffer the consequences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The original criteria of the legislation passed in this chamber only three to four months ago were too restrictive. Companies have not been applying for this allowance. The Government could not advertise that capital investment was occurring. Therefore, the only reason the Opposition can see why the Government is proposing these amendments before us today is that, with the relaxation of the criteria, one or two capital projects will register with the DAA for this particular allowance. The Government can then state that the economy is recovering and say, `Look at the investment that is occurring'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, the coalition believes that this current Bill is clearly a blatant attempt by the Government in a pre-election environment to maximise the number of companies that will qualify, at least on paper, for assistance. When this happens the Government can then state that it is getting investments back on track. Since this Bill is an attempt to acknowledge certain of the defects in the parent legislation&mdash;although as I have explained, it is quite inadequate&mdash;the Liberal-National coalition will not be opposing this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are discussing the Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill 1992 which seeks to amend the original legislation, the Development Allowance Authority Act 1992. This piece of legislation seeks to reduce the restrictions which govern the eligibility of a particular project to qualify for the development allowance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The development allowance is a tax concession which was announced in the One Nation statement and is an investment allowance at a rate of 10 per cent for projects registered before 31 December 1992 and with a value greater than $50m. It was a measure specifically designed to stimulate investment to assist in returning decent levels of economic growth. However, we would agree with Senator Watson that it is a fairly cynical election ploy to fast track investment and development to create jobs in the lead-up to an election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that there are numerous amendments to various sections and I am concerned that there has been a need for such major surgery on this legislation just four months after the principal Act was put in place. Indeed, I note that the Scrutiny of Bills Committee has requested an explanation from the Minister as to why these amendments were required so soon after the passage of the principal Act. The need for these amendments highlights the fact that this concession was conceived and introduced on the run as part of the Government's political agenda and, hence, was not properly thought through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is therefore obvious that this amending Bill is in response to the valid criticisms levelled against the principal Act by wide sections of industry. I find it hard to believe that the Government did not perceive a necessity to allow applicants for the development allowance to elect to aggregate two or more joint venture projects or specified projects and to bring expenditure incurred in the long term lease of certain new units of plant within the ambit of the original Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hesitate to use the term `sloppy legislation' in this place, but this would appear to be the case. It is obvious that the original legislation has not been able to attract the high level of investment that the Government had envisaged. The Opposition opposed the original legislation on the basis that it was too restrictive and that it was only available to large projects and was too interventionist. It is clear that this criticism of its being applicable only to large projects has in fact been vindicated by the Opposition and the necessity for this particular amending Bill. I would suggest to the Government that perhaps we might see even further amendments to the development allowance which might bring down the threshold of projects that are eligible for the concession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can the Opposition oppose restricting industry assistance to those initiatives which involve international best practice as is the case with the development allowance? At the very time when we are facing the imperative of becoming more efficient or perishing, it is essential that we as legislators insist that new projects which obtain special concessions be as competitive as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Democrats see no reason not to support this legislation. We have previously criticised the principal Act in that it does not make the allowance available for projects within industries whose nominal and effective rate of assistance is greater than 10 per cent. This badly impacts on the textile, clothing and footwear industries and on the passenger motor vehicle industry. We voiced that criticism when this legislation came before us last time, and we voice it now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would also agree with Senator Watson's assertion that the original Bill discriminated against small projects and against ventures with a low development threshold. We believe that in particular this discriminates against new developing high-tech industries. The exclusion of any sector which is protected is a short-sighted and flawed notion and will act against the longer term restructuring that these industries must undergo. Indeed, it is these very industries which need high levels of investment in new plant and equipment in order to survive into the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's and Opposition's determination to butcher these vital industries&mdash;industries which employ thousands of Australians&mdash;through a blind commitment to the almost total abolition of tariffs is quite beyond reason. These industries cannot compete against low wage countries without far superior productivity and this can only occur through massive new investment in plant and equipment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the bleak outlook for domestic production, it is little wonder that there is a dearth of investment which is essential to these industries' survival. As such, the development allowance should be available for investments which meet the best practice criteria, irrespective of the state of protection, especially since there may be no protection at all during the lifetime of the facility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am led to believe that the Development Allowance Authority is, as we speak, receiving applications on the assumption that these proposed amendments will become law. The Government appears to be eager to be viewed favourably by a wider section of industry than that covered by the original legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We did attempt to get some figures from the Development Allowance Authority to see exactly how the original legislation has been performing. We were unable to obtain those statistics. However, I do believe that Senator McMullan has some figures here and will present them later on in the debate. We will certainly be very interested to hear what he has to say. I wish that we had had an opportunity to obtain that information before this legislation came before the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to honourable senators that the original legislation has not had the anticipated effect of revitalising business investment. It is a white elephant and the Government is now frantically legislating amendments in an attempt to encourage business to invest and soak up  some  of  the  mass  of unemployed</PARA>
<PARA>people who are presently floating forlornly through CES offices with no hope of a job in the immediate future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, the legislation has failed in its aim of attracting major investment. This is why I have circulated the second reading amendment which states:</PARA>

For example, as I said, the $50m threshold will remain although improvements in and upgrading of existing facilities will be able to be aggregated with new facilities for the threshold test. In addition, the existing law does not allow for the aggregation of leased and purchased interests to be combined in assessing eligibility for the allowance. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are various other technical amendments effected by the legislation. I will only comment on one of these&mdash;that is, the extension of the definition of Australia to include all offshore waters. The effect of this change is to deliberately extend the development allowance to certain offshore oil and gas projects. Whilst not opposing this change, I feel it is useful to examine the recent record of the Government in extending assistance to fossil fuel industries. We saw the abolition of the coal export duty from 1 July 1992 at a cost of $47m per year. In 1990 we saw a significant relaxation of the petroleum rent resource tax at the cost of hundreds of millions of dollars over the next five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had numerous amendments to income tax legislation in terms of the timing of the deductibility of resource rent tax payments and the allowance of offshore platform removal expenses as a deduction. Yet at the same time, we have seen the pathetic dribble of a couple of million dollars a year in funding renewable energy research and development. This from a government which claims to be pursuing sustainable development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Getting to Work</EMPHASIS> policy statement, the Australian Democrats state that the development allowance of 10 per cent should be broadened into an ecologically sustainable development allowance. All firms, regardless of size, would be entitled to an ESD allowance in respect of investments which qualify for immediate deduction as pollution abatement or renewable energy efficiency conversions. We have also set out a variety of taxation measures to encourage ecologically sustainable practices in industry, such as restructuring the sales tax on motor vehicles to favour fuel efficient vehicles and to penalise non-efficient vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats is the only party which supports reasonable encouragement of this industry into the twenty-first century. As detailed in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Getting to Work</EMPHASIS>, we must encourage the shift from fossil fuels to low carbon fuels and renewable energy. We have to seriously address energy efficiency, primarily at the design stage in products and buildings. Such an approach is also integral to fulfilling the Toronto targets of stabilising greenhouse gas emissions. What we need is recognition of the leading edge work of our academics. This is no longer theory; it is technical reality. Professors David Mills, Martin Green and Stephen Kaneff would be highly honoured in Japan. In Australia they are almost totally unknown and have to scrimp to obtain any kind of funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the 1980s, the funding for renewable energy fell by more than 80 per cent in real terms at a time when great technical progress was made and by a government which claimed it was the greenest in the world. We need to foster this expertise with financing to start building commercial scale plants and to create markets for the private sector to thrive on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax changes needed to foster this industry are immediate tax deductibility for renewable energy systems installed by business, whether in new buildings or retro-fitting existing structures, accelerated depreciation rates for energy efficient buildings, elimination of sales tax on all items which conserve energy or generate renewable energy, a reinstatement of the taxation rebate which used to exist for the cost of domestic insulation and a system of financing renewable energy technologies for widespread use&mdash;for example, to enable households to install solar hot water systems and pay off the capital cost by diverting the savings in energy costs. Private industry will not do it, so the public sector will have to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even the US Congress is preparing a landmark energy Bill which contemplates that about 50 per cent of the US's total energy will come from renewable sources by the year 2030. Japan has also started seriously pursuing this area so unless we commercialise our expertise fast, we will be left behind. We will also steadily lose our energy export markets as the world switches to renewables. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is what sustainable development means. This is what the clever country means. It is about time the old parties stopped ignoring this emerging technology and started supporting Australian ingenuity and creating Australian jobs. The Australian Democrats support the Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill for the same reason that we supported the original legislation. We believe that the potential benefits to Australia's high technology export industries are too great to be put at risk by petty political point scoring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the view of the Australian Democrats, industry is fighting backwards in one lost nation. The level playing field is really a vertical cliff over which industry is falling into an abyss of bankruptcy, rising imports and increased regulation. We do not support the level playing field. For industry to prosper we need pro-active measures on behalf of the Government to encourage investment in manufacturing, plant and equipment and to encourage Australians to throw off the enveloping cloak of recession depression and start actively promoting business investment to foster economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the development allowance was first legislated, the Australian Democrats requested the opportunity to reassess it in 18 months' time and make any necessary amendments to improve it. The Government itself has needed to do this just four months after the principal Act was brought before us. I would agree with Senator Watson that the existing terms of the development allowance are far too restrictive and, as I said earlier, it would not surprise me if we are once again faced with having to make amendments to this legislation to provide a climate in which investment can take place in this country. We do however support the notion of sectoral assistance and suggest that this particular measure could be broadened to make it more accessible to a whole range of Australian industries that are currently excluded from the legislation. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate for its cooperation in facilitating the passage of the Development Allowance Authority Bill this evening. I thank all senators, particularly Senator Watson and Senator Sowada, for somewhat shortening their contributions to make it possible for us more readily to deal with this legislation. I hope they will therefore forgive me if in reciprocating I do not respond specifically to the points they raised in the way I usually would because we all want to get the legislation passed quickly and not abuse the cooperation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will deal with the response to the amendment in some detail, but first I think some matters that are of some importance for those seeking to interpret the legislation need to be put on the record. The Development Allowance Authority Act 1992 provides an income tax deduction in addition to depreciation of 10 per cent of the amount of capital expenditure incurred by taxpayers on the acquisition or lease of new units of plant and equipment to be used in Australia within projects of $50m or more which meet certain criteria. The allowance applies in the year in which the particular plant is first used or held ready for use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The allowance is targeted towards the stimulation of investment in large projects which can satisfy the DAA that they are world competitive and that the environment within which they operate is also competitive. Projects which are heavily assisted are excluded from eligibility. Each applicant must satisfy the DAA that the project does not have a nominal or effective rate of assistance, taking the lower, exceeding 10 per cent. These measures of assistance are to be calculated separately for each project taking into account all assistance received by the particular project from all levels of government in a manner consistent with the methodology used by the Industry Commission to calculate assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of key dates in the legislation, the most immediately pressing of which is 1 January 1993, before which all applications must have been received by the DAA if they are to be considered. Obviously the primary purpose of this Bill is to amend the principal Act to increase the flexibility of the legislation so that a more consistent approach is available to the various types of prospective applicant for the development allowance. These amendments provide that additional flexibility for claiming the benefit, in particular in passing the $50m threshold. The opportunity is also taken to make minor adjustments to the drafting of certain provisions in the principal Act to facilitate interpretation by applicants for the allowance and to make some minor administrative adjustments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think I can construct everything else I want to say as a response to the second reading amendment that was moved by Senator Sowada. It is important to say that, notwithstanding that no application has been approved so far, the development allowance is a long way from having been a failure. Over 200 persons have approached the Development Allowance Authority secretariat seeking information and application forms. A number of these people are consultants, professional firms or very large companies which are working on more than one project. There are a large number of projects under consideration for application for this allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Authority has received a number of applications&mdash;a number of applications are currently before the Development Allowance Authority&mdash;and other draft applications. These are being processed at this moment. Most interest has been expressed by the mining industry and the minerals processing industry&mdash;two areas where most Australians would agree that new investment would be of great benefit to the Australian economy&mdash;because of the investment itself and the jobs and exports which may well be generated. A large proportion of companies that are expressing interest are proposing export oriented projects, which is what we hope would be the case, and offering some cause for optimism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the amendment is not to remedy a failure of the allowance, because there are a number of applications being processed under the Act as it stands, but, as I said, to increase the flexibility of the legislation. The development allowance was an important One Nation initiative. The Development Allowance Authority and the legislation which underpins it will have a very important role to play in enhancing the speed and the nature of the recovery. As this recovery is developed and enhanced, its nature and rate of development will be significantly enhanced by the projects which are approved and received. They will be either initiated when they otherwise might not have been or, at the very least, brought forward so that they may be undertaken more quickly. That is exactly what Australia needs at this stage of the economic cycle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the normal course of speaking on such a Bill&mdash;even though it is not an important Bill; it is a Bill about an important matter&mdash;I would have addressed in more detail some of the questions that were raised.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I rise to pay tribute to a great public servant. I am referring to the just retired Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner, Mr Richard Beetham. As a consequence, it would be remiss if this Senate did not recognise Richard Beetham's retirement as a commissioner. Mr Beetham's resignation was announced in the press last Friday after the ISC confirmed this move last Thursday night.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Beetham had just completed his five-year appointment on 30 September. During those five years he headed a commission which had been inadequately resourced and yet managed, through unstinting dedication from both himself and his staff, to cope with the vast overload of work presented. For this he deserves the full respect of this chamber and the superannuation and insurance industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To state that this man's resignation has come as a surprise to both myself and the superannuation and insurance industry would be an understatement and is indicative of the respect of the work done by the Commission under his leadership. I am disappointed to see him not continue his career within the Public Service. I note that when the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> contacted various insurance industry executives they all praised Mr Beetham's work and stated that there were few people within the ISC who were, or who were likely to be, successors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Richard Beetham was the inaugural commissioner of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, appointed in 1987 when the then Treasurer, Mr Keating, combined into one organisation the supervisory policy advising and industry liaison responsibilities within the Government in regard to the life insurance, general insurance and occupational superannuation industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequently, here we have a man who had the responsibility for the establishment and development of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. Over the years this body has had the supreme supervision of all life insurance, superannuation and general insurance industries and provision of policy advice on all matters relating to these industries. He came to the ISC fully qualified, having been the First Assistant Secretary of the Financial Institutions Division, Federal Treasury, for the eight previous years. In this position he was involved in giving policy advice and administration relating to most aspects of the structure and operations of the Australian financial system, including banking, other financial institutions, companies and securities markets, export finance, foreign exchange, insurance and superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, during those eight years as First Assistant Secretary he served on numerous committees, either as chairman or as a member, which all served to qualify him further for his role as commissioner of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. In particular, I note that he was the chairman  of the Commonwealth committee on retirement incomes and chairman of the Commonwealth task force on occupational superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Richard Beetham's career has been one of the public servant. He emigrated to Australia early in his career in 1962 to avail himself of the Reserve Bank of Australia scholarship at the University of Adelaide where he researched and published his thesis on the development of non-bank financial institutions in Australia and implications for monetary theory and policy. From here he served for several years at the Reserve Bank as an economist and from thence into the Federal Treasury in both the Banking and Insurance Branch and the already mentioned Financial Institutions Division. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Beetham's career with the Treasury was further extended during the three years he served at the Embassy of Australia in Washington, DC, and at the Australian High Commission, Ottawa, Canada. In Washington he was the Treasurer's senior representative. Whilst in these two posts he was involved in monitoring the economic and financial developments of both the US and Canada. He also represented Australia at the UN and liaised with private sector executives on economic and financial matters pertaining to Australia and North America. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Richard Beetham has been in charge of the ISC at a time of unprecedented change, both to policy and in the spread of superannuation, all against a backdrop of financial deregulation and turmoil. Indeed, it was the speed of Richard Beetham that prevented further chaos and loss in the ill-fated Occidental and Regal Insurance scam. The ISC stands on the verge of a massive strengthening of its supervisory powers and as the superannuation industry enters a new phase of growth in the wake of a superannuation guarantee charge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Richard Beetham's swan song will be the soon to be released prudential statement. I understand this is due out in a few days, or perhaps later this month. This prudential statement will provide a new framework for the superannuation industry with a considerable increase in ISC responsibilities and tight new regulations governing the activities of superannuation funds. I do not think that he would take it amiss if I were to say that he has performed his onerous tasks in the best traditions of the Public Service&mdash;that is, in a low-key, meticulous, cooperative and extremely competent manner. He has sought practical and sensible solutions to a mass of new problems in an area of intense policy debate and human interest and has resisted the temptation to engage in political debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whatever dissatisfaction we on this side may feel about the unrealistic pace and discretion of policy in superannuation, it does not extend to Richard Beetham, who has performed his duties admirably. I shall miss seeing him at the ISC section of the Estimates and at various superannuation and insurance inquiries at which I have had the pleasure of hearing him speak. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the resignation has come about for personal reasons. At 56, Richard Beetham is still young enough to be able to pursue his other interests. I have been informed that he may even consider another full time position. Personally, I believe that his qualifications would make him an excellent director or member of a company board. Indeed, I would like to take this opportunity of saying that I had always envisaged Richard Beetham on the Reserve Bank Board because of his outstanding financial and economic qualifications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that today the Federal Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) has announced the new ISC Commissioner as Mr George Pooley. Mr Pooley is another senior Treasury official and former member of the Foreign Investment Review Board. I have been told that Mr Pooley occupied Richard Beetham's old position in Treasury. It is indeed a mark of the ability of the ex-Commissioner that the Government has deliberately looked to another man with the same background. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate Mr Pooley on his appointment and look forward to having the same relationship that existed between myself and other members of this chamber with the ex-Commissioner. More importantly at this time I wish the retiring Commissioner, Mr Richard Beetham, well in whatever he decides to do next. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today, hundreds of thousands of people assembled in Mexico City. I quote from a letter written by Mary Salter, who is currently residing in Mexico City, describing this event:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Well, it so happens that 1992 is the year of the 500th anniversary of the "discovery" of America. And the big day is October 12th 1992. As you may well imagine, the celebration for many people is somewhat mixed, especially for the Indians of both North and South America. Here in Chiapas, where I live currently, there are many problems for the INDIGENAS (local Indians) in the terms of land rights, freedom of speech, poverty, education and political manipulation by the State.</PARA>
<PARA>She continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So&mdash;what is this all about? Well, to remind people all over the world that there has and very definitely still is another side to the story&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>of Columbus's discovery of America&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">there has been organised a very big walk/march. Indians from all over the continent will converge in Mexico City on October 12th. The march began in the north in Alaska and the south in Argentina. . . in approximately April of this year.</PARA>
<PARA>She goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As fate would have it, on 12th October last year, at lunchtime, I just happened to be in the centre of Mexico City and witnessed this amazing spectacle. All traffic stopped whilst hundreds of Indians, of all ages, converged on the central plaza. They came in broken down trucks, ancient cast-off school buses, by foot and in big open-sided cattle trucks. Many were very old and having arrived slept through most of the speeches. You could see that a lot had walked hundreds of miles. They spoke about world unity in a common cause, about their right to basic survival off the land, and much more. They left off with a global call to be in the same place, same time in 1992.</PARA>
<PARA>In Mary Salter's letter, she remarks on the similarity of the problems of the Indian people to those of Aboriginal people in Australia. The comparison is appropriate. I therefore remind the Senate of the importance of 1993 being the Year for the World's Indigenous People. While it does not officially commence until 10 December 1992, it is certainly not too early to raise the issue in the Senate, especially on this day, and to consider how this year can provide a landmark in the place of indigenous people in today's world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate of the national objectives of the Year for the World's Indigenous People so that we can seek to fulfil them in the year ahead. They are, first, to enhance relations between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and the broader community; secondly, to increase the knowledge and understanding in the domestic and international community about the world's indigenous peoples, in particular, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples; thirdly, to identify activities through policy and program development to improve the socio-cultural position of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples; and, finally, to maximise the involvement of non-government organisations, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and community-based individuals in the achievement of the national objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I seek to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> some words of Burnum Burnum, a man who, in his own words, had to search `to get closer to my own Aboriginality'. The words come from an extract from the foreword of Burnum Burnum's book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Traveller's Guide to Aboriginal Australia</EMPHASIS>. They present an authentic and authoritative account while seeking to extend the hand of friendship to guide us all into a respectful and enriching future together. It is a short extract, but to save the time of the Senate I seek leave to incorporate it into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The extract read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This book is the expression of that mission, an attempt to give the traveller a chance to view this extraordinary country as it was seen by the original Australians. On the journey we get a glimpse of the Dreamtime through the oral traditions of many of the nations which made up this great country. The work of archaeologists is also illuminating, as they scrape through layers of history in their own search for the roots of perhaps the most successful people who ever lived on this planet. Modern ecology can learn a great deal from a people who managed and maintained their world so well for 50 000 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we move through the landscape and the traditional lands of the nations who once ruled this continent, we see how they lived, the foods they ate and the traditions which kept their culture alive for so long. Much of this lives on today and Australians are gaining a new pride in their real heritage, the one which covers 2000 generations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The story has an inevitable edge of sadness, as we understand the process and pattern of dispossession suffered after 1788. This material has been included not to provoke guilt, but to give a perception of the extraordinary differences between the original Australians and the invaders who came in 1788. In most areas of early contact, they were greeted warmly by the Australians, who had no idea that these strange white people intended to stay. The land had been under their control and guidance going back to the Dreamtime; every hill, valley, river, animal and plant had been placed in the landscape for the use of the people. The thought of somebody arriving from the edge of the ocean to simply take their lands was inconceivable and the reality of their new position was slow to dawn. When it did, resistance grew and we will look at the efforts of several individuals who stood courageously against the invasion of firepower of the Europeans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also see the ongoing struggle for land rights, as attempts are made to redress the imbalance of dispossession created by the doctrine of terra nullius, which meant, literally, that there were no people on the continent. Non-Aboriginal people often find it difficult to understand the traditional relationship between the land and its people. The concept of land ownership, in the western model, was simply beyond the comprehension of the original Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Europe, as people developed their civilisation from the caves to the cathedrals, they left clear evidence of their achievement for future generations to admire. In Australia, the land itself is the cathedral and worship is not confined to any four walls. Each step is a prayer and every form in the landscape&mdash;and every thing that moves in it&mdash;were put there specifically for the people to use and manage. And the mythic beings made clear the responsibility of the people in preserving and nurturing the environment. Their success in managing their world so successfully, and sustaining their culture for so long, is now attracting the world-wide respect it deserves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope the reader will find no bitterness in the story: the past cannot be turned back. The story of dispossession is a sand and moving one, but many of the Dreamtime stories are equally tragic. The challenge of the future is the important issue, and an acceptance of the past is the first step to a positive future.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My attention has been drawn to an anomaly that I hope can be rectified in relation to the issuing of passports. The problem relates to people who were born in the United Kingdom, many of whom served in the Second World War but who had migrated to Australia prior to the commencement of the Second World War. They are now being asked when they renew their passports to produce documents of citizenship, which they were not originally required to do when they were granted Australian citizenship in the 1950s, and at a very high cost.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These people are now quite advanced in years. The correspondent who has raised the issue with me is 76 and, as he says, is `still going'. It is an enormous difficulty. If I might highlight the problem that my constituent has raised, I think it will shed light on the general issue. My constituent, a Mr Thompson, migrated to Australia in 1936. At the outbreak of the Second World War he joined the 2nd AIF. At the end of the Second World War, he was demobbed and returned to Australia, and in 1949 he became an Australian citizen by virtue of an Act of Parliament. In 1950, he applied for and was granted an Australian passport which stated inside the cover that he was an Australian subject in accordance with the Nationality Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1989, Mr Thompson sought to renew his then expired passport and was told that he could not do so unless he provided documents of citizenship, which were going to cost him a not insubstantial sum of money. He refused to do so on principle, the principle being that he already had an Australian passport and was now being put to extra expense notwithstanding the fact that by an Act of Parliament he had been granted Australian citizenship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the intervening period, he does not seem to have had any luck in getting this matter properly addressed. As he quite neatly points out, when he came back from the Second World War and returned to Australia, having been demobbed, he was not asked to pay $50 for a visa. Because of the rush to get overseas in 1989, he had to get a British passport but was required to pay $50 on top of the cost of the British passport to get his visa to come back into the country, notwithstanding the fact that he has dual citizenship. He had to get the visa of course because he did not have an Australian passport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No doubt many people are in Mr Thompson's position. Something needs to be done to rectify this position. These men and women are veterans who have served this country very well. They are Australian citizens, but by a quirk of government regulation they are now required to go to additional expense should they wish to renew their passports. If these fine men and women wish to display and be proud of their Australian nationality by carrying an Australian passport, I believe it is inappropriate for the Government to make it more difficult for them to do so. I hope that somebody in the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs or somebody else within the Government can write to me or perhaps Mr Thompson to clarify the position and, hopefully, eliminate this absurd problem which currently exists. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1989-90 Budget it was announced that age and service pensioners, both full rate and part rate, would be removed from the taxation system by 1995 in the context of removing disincentives to individuals undertaking retirement savings and encouraging greater self provision in retirement. The cost of the reforms for the aged announced in the April 1989 Economic Statement and the 1989-90 Budget&mdash;including the 1995 commitment&mdash;was put at over $1 billion.</PARA>

This will ensure that effective marginal tax rates are kept to acceptable levels.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In responding to this question I have taken advice from the Interim National Accreditation Council (INAC).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) A national child care accreditation system, which focuses on outcome measures such as curriculum and interactions between staff and children, is necessary to ensure children have access to quality child care and ensure accountability for government expenditure on child care centres (estimated at $283m in 1992-93). State regulations vary widely and deal generally with costly building and staffing inputs but do not deal with actual quality outcomes for children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accreditation provides an opportunity for parents and staff to work on low-cost improvements to quality in their services by a process of self-assessment endorsed by peer review. Accreditation also provides a self regulatory alternative to other quality measures, which have traditionally been characterised by very high costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Committee of Child Care Industry Representatives, chaired by Ms Mary Crawford MP, identified the desirability of linking elements of accreditation to eligibility for Child Care Fee Relief to ensure that the Government and the community had quality assurances.</PARA>

The Committee acknowledged the weight of community support for accreditation.</PARA>

The Government included the development of detailed costings and budget for the accreditation system in INAC's Terms of Reference.

Final estimates will be included in the final report to the Government.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The release of the names and addresses of both individuals and groups who made submissions in relation to this legislation raises serious issues of privacy. I am not prepared to release such details.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The overwhelming majority of responses were in favour of the Commonwealth legislating in this area and gave broad support to the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were, however, a number of areas where some concerns were expressed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Definition of Disability</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of submissions indicated that a less medical definition of disability would help to preclude value judgements being made on the abilities of people with disabilities. There were also concerns that certain disabilities such as cognitive and neurological disorders were not covered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The definition is based on existing legislation in the States and Territories. The use of the terms such as `condition' as suggested by some submissions was thought capable of including such temporary states as drunkenness or the effects of the recreational use of drugs. Whilst it is arguable that this is not the case it was thought that to use this word would have the potential to cause confusion and as result no amendment was adopted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to cognitive and neurological disorders, subclause (g) of the definition was inserted specifically to include such disabilities. The Explanatory Memorandum has been amended to include reference to these disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unjustifiable Hardship</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of submissions considered that not only should the evidentiary burden of proving that unjustifiable hardship be with the person asserting that he or she will suffer it but that that person should have the legal burden of proving unjustifiable hardship on the balance of probabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst a number of State Acts do contain such a burden this is not consistent with usual Commonwealth policy and could impose considerable burdens upon small business and industry. It is believed that the existing provision represents a satisfactory compromise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Action Plans</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were a number of concerns expressed about the lack of a formal mechanism to check, monitor and review action plans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concept of action plans is that they be voluntary and not be forced upon service providers as another way of enforcing minimum standards. To establish an effective monitoring mechanism would involve the establishment of another agency with the attendant cost involved in that process. The incentive is there for service providers to compile such plans in that they are able to plan for a longer term solution to the problems of discriminatory practices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Disability Standards</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was considerable comment received in relation to the need for all parties potentially affected by such standards to be involved in an extensive consultation process if and when it is decided that such standards are necessary. Such comment has been received from those States who have responded to the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As indicated by the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services in the Second Reading Speech and reinforced by the Minister's Parliamentary Secretary during the Committee stage in the House the Government is very aware of the potential effect of any standards that may be introduced. The Government is quite prepared to give an unequivocal undertaking that such consultations will be entered into both on the formulation of draft standards and on the actual draft standards prior to them being enacted in regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some submissions also asked why the standards do not cover all areas of discrimination covered by the Bill.

The clause is closely based upon similar provisions in the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 and the Sex Discrimination Act 1984.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to telecommunications carriers, this exemption only relates to their operations as service providers not as employers and only operates for a period of three years.

They particularly raised the issue of people who were HIV positive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government considers that the legislation provides sufficient protection to health professionals. Firstly, the provisions of clause 48 provide that it is not an unlawful practice to discriminate where that discrimination relates to infectious diseases and is necessary to protect public health. Further the provision of health services would come under clause 24 of the Bill. That provision is subject to the exemption relating to unjustifiable hardship. When determining whether unjustifiable hardship exists clause 11(a) requires the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to take into account the nature of the benefit or detriment likely to be suffered by all concerned including, in this case, the health professional.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator Collins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) I am advised by AOTC that ISDN is a network which interworks with AOTC's other network based services including the Public Switched Telephone service (PSTN), MobileNet, CustomNet Spectrum and the various information services. Therefore, it is possible for voice calls to be established between any two customers connected to any of these network based services. ISDN is currently unique because it is designed to carry digital data and voice services all on the one network. However, digital data will only be carried between two parties if they are both connected to the ISDN.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The technology of ISDN is complex and it is unlikely that accidental interception would occur. Not only are the communications channels separated from the signalling channels but there is a significant level of partitioning between the paths of communication between any two customers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the possibility of illicit or illegal interception can never be ruled out, the probability of such an incident is diminished on ISDN because of the technical complexity of the service and the cost of the required equipment. If customers require a higher degree of privacy or security it is possible for them to include encryption devices in the path of the communications circuit on their customer equipment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) No, I am not aware of any specific cases of inadvertent access to ISDN lines. However, as indicated in my response to question (1), there is the potential for such connections to be established because of the interworking of networks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) ISDN customers who subscribe to the calling line identification presentation (CLIP) service can receive the calling line identification (CLI) of callers who are also on the ISDN.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the honourable senator has any information of a specific incident where this was not the case, AOTC has indicated that it would be pleased to investigate the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) A customer who is connected to ISDN has control over the forward presentation of identification information to a called party. It is a matter of choice whether the customer forwards identification information with calls.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A customer who is connected to ISDN has the capability to screen incoming calls to selectively deflect unwanted calls if the incoming call includes CLI. This capability is most useful if CLI is normally presented as part of a normal call and enhances a customer's level of privacy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The signalling systems which are available between the carriers will provide Optus with the ability to manage the privacy of their customers in a similar manner to AOTC.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) Disclosure by AOTC of information on Government agencies connected to ISDN is not permitted under the Telecommunications Act 1991. The information on their subscription to CLIP is therefore also confidential.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) On the information available to the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), the regulatory situation in foreign countries for the cyclodiene pesticides chlordane and heptachlor is as follows. In the USA, chlordane and heptachlor maintain conditional registration pending the receipt of air monitoring studies. To date, these studies have not been received by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and therefore these products are precluded from sale or use in the USA. In the United Kingdom, registrations for chlordane and heptachlor have been revoked due to persistence of these chemicals in the environment. In Canada most registrations for heptachlor have been withdrawn due to environmental persistence, while limited registrations of chlordane remain. These chemicals apparently continue to be used in some other countries, particularly for termite control, with varying degrees of restriction. Further details on the status of these chemicals in other countries is outlined in the draft Report of the NHMRC Working Party on Cyclodiene Insecticide Use in Australia which was released for public comment in January 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The use of these chemicals in Australia has been severely restricted. Further restrictive steps were proposed in the draft report referred to in (1) above and the issue will be further considered by the NHMRC at its Council meeting in November this year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Two agencies which classify chemicals as carcinogens in the way the Senator refers are the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The IARC has recently re-reviewed the epidemiological data and animal toxicology data on the potential carcinogenicity of chlordane and heptachlor which is published in volume 53 of its monograph series. On the basis of the epidemiological data and case reports, it was concluded that there is inadequate evidence in humans for the carcinogenicity of chlordane and of heptachlor. On the basis of the animal toxicology data, it was concluded that there is sufficient evidence in experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of chlordane and heptachlor. The overall evaluation according to the criteria of the IARC classification scheme, was that both chlordane and heptachlor are possibly carcinogenic to humans. The US EPA classify chlordane and heptachlor similarly, according to the EPA's Guidelines for Carcinogenic Risk Assessment.</PARA>
